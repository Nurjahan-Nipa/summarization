2056,2067,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View). In some cases the model can also be used to turn a data source into a higher level abstraction as well. A good example of this is the MVC Storefront project. There is a discussion here regarding the differences between MVC vs MVP. The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view. Having said that, ASP.NET MVC is by these definitions an MVP framework because the Controller accesses the Model to populate the View which is meant to have no logic (just  displays the variables provided by the Controller). To perhaps get an idea of the ASP.NET MVC distinction from MVP, check out this MIX presentation by Scott Hanselman.","MVP and MVC are presentation patterns that separate domain objects, UI, and behavior. The key difference is that in MVC, the Model directly updates the View, whereas in MVP, the Presenter accesses the Model and interacts with the View.","Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View).

3058,3082,What is Inversion of Control?,"Wikipedia Article. To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. Instead of your program explicitly controlling everything, your program sets up a class or library with certain functions to be called when certain things happen. It solves code duplication. For example, in the old days you would manually write your own event loop, polling the system libraries for new events. Nowadays, most modern APIs you simply tell the system libraries what events you're interested in, and it will let you know when they happen. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control. Inversion of control is made easy in many languages through the concept of delegates, interfaces, or even raw function pointers. It is not appropriate to use in all cases, because the flow of a program can be harder to follow when written this way. It's a useful way to design methods when writing a library that will be reused, but it should be used sparingly in the core of your own program unless it really solves a code duplication problem.","Inversion of Control is a design pattern that turns sequential code into a delegation structure, allowing a program to set up a class or library to handle specific actions when certain events occur, reducing code duplication.","To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure.

For example, in an old school menu, you might have: thereby controlling the flow of user interaction. In a GUI program or somesuch, instead we say So now control is inverted... instead of the computer accepting user input in a fixed order, the user controls the order in which the data is entered, and when the data is saved in the database.

For example, say your application has a text editor component and you want to provide spell checking. Your standard code would look something like this: What we've done here creates a dependency between the <code>TextEditor</code> and the <code>SpellChecker</code>. In an IoC scenario we would instead do something like this: In the first code example we are instantiating <code>SpellChecker</code> (<code>this.checker = new SpellChecker();</code>), which means the <code>TextEditor</code> class directly depends on the <code>SpellChecker</code> class. In the second code example we are creating an abstraction by having the <code>SpellChecker</code> dependency class in <code>TextEditor</code> constructor signature (not initializing dependency in class). This allows us to call the dependency then pass it to the TextEditor class like so: Now the client creating the <code>TextEditor</code> class has the control over which <code>SpellChecker</code> implementation to use because we're injecting the dependency to the <code>TextEditor</code> signature. This is just a simple example, there's a good series of articles by Simone Busoli that explains it in greater detail.","Inversion of Control (IoC) removes dependencies from code by decoupling classes.

It's the same idea as Jeff's but I think it's a little clearer because it separates out the logic for subtracting one, so it's a little easier to understand.

2056,4087,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"MVP: the view is in charge. The view, in most cases, creates its presenter. The presenter will interact with the model and manipulate the view through an interface. The view will sometimes interact with the presenter, usually through some interface. This comes down to implementation; do you want the view to call methods on the presenter or do you want the view to have events the presenter listens to? It boils down to this: The view knows about the presenter. The view delegates to the presenter. MVC: the controller is in charge. The controller is created or accessed based on some event/request. The controller then creates the appropriate view and interacts with the model to further configure the view. It boils down to: the controller creates and manages the view; the view is slave to the controller. The view does not know about the controller.","MVP: The view creates its presenter and delegates to it, interacting through an interface. The view knows about the presenter.

2056,5712,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Also worth remembering is that there are different types of MVPs as well. Fowler has broken the pattern into two - Passive View and Supervising Controller. When using Passive View, your View typically implement a fine-grained interface with properties mapping more or less directly to the underlaying UI widget. For instance, you might have a ICustomerView with properties like Name and Address. Your implementation might look something like this: Your Presenter class will talk to the model and ""map"" it to the view. This approach is called the ""Passive View"". The benefit is that the view is easy to test, and it is easier to move between UI platforms (Web, Windows/XAML, etc.). The disadvantage is that you can't leverage things like databinding (which is really powerful in frameworks like WPF and Silverlight). The second flavor of MVP is the Supervising Controller. In that case your View might have a property called Customer, which then again is databound to the UI widgets. You don't have to think about synchronizing and micro-manage the view, and the Supervising Controller can step in and help when needed, for instance with compled interaction logic. The third ""flavor"" of MVP (or someone would perhaps call it a separate pattern) is the Presentation Model (or sometimes referred to Model-View-ViewModel). Compared to the MVP you ""merge"" the M and the P into one class. You have your customer object which your UI widgets is data bound to, but you also have additional UI-spesific fields like ""IsButtonEnabled"", or ""IsReadOnly"", etc. I think the best resource I've found to UI architecture is the series of blog posts done by Jeremy Miller over at The Build Your Own CAB Series Table of Contents. He covered all the flavors of MVP and showed C# code to implement them. I have also blogged about the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in the context of Silverlight over at YouCard Re-visited: Implementing the ViewModel pattern.","MVP = Model-View-Presenter, MVC = Model-View-Controller. The key difference is MVC allows the model to update the view directly. There are three MVP variations: Passive View, Supervising Controller, and Presentation Model (or Model-View-ViewModel). Passive View involves a fine-grained interface with properties mapping to UI widgets, while Supervising Controller handles synchronization and interaction logic. Presentation Model merges the model and presenter into a single class, adding UI-specific fields.","When using Passive View, your View typically implement a fine-grained interface with properties mapping more or less directly to the underlaying UI widget.

2056,26933,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"MVP is not necessarily a scenario where the View is in charge (see Taligent's MVP for example). I find it unfortunate that people are still preaching this as a pattern (View in charge) as opposed to an anti-pattern as it contradicts ""It's just a view"" (Pragmatic Programmer). ""It's just a view"" states that the final view shown to the user is a secondary concern of the application. Microsoft's MVP pattern renders re-use of Views much more difficult and conveniently excuses Microsoft's designer from encouraging bad practice. To be perfectly frank, I think the underlying concerns of MVC hold true for any MVP implementation and the differences are almost entirely semantic. As long as you are following separation of concerns between the view (that displays the data), the controller (that initialises and controls user interaction) and the model (the underlying data and/or services)) then you are acheiving the benefits of MVC. If you are acheiving the benefits then who really cares whether your pattern is MVC, MVP or Supervising Controller? The only real pattern remains as MVC, the rest are just differing flavours of it. Consider this highly exciting article that comprehensively lists a number of these differing implementations. You may note that they're all basically doing the same thing but slightly differently. I personally think MVP has only been recently re-introduced as a catchy term to either reduce arguments between semantic bigots who argue whether something is truly MVC or not or to justify Microsofts Rapid Application Development tools. Neither of these reasons in my books justify its existence as a separate design pattern.","MVP and MVC are presentation patterns that separate domain objects, UI, and behavior.

34510,34550,What is a race condition?,"A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are ""racing"" to access/change the data. Problems often occur when one thread does a ""check-then-act"" (e.g. ""check"" if the value is X, then ""act"" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the ""check"" and the ""act"". E.g: The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing. In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time.

34510,34578,What is a race condition?,"Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems. A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do. This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access. There's almost always a race condition when one thread calls sleep to give another thread time to finish a task (unless that sleep is in a loop, with some checking mechanism). Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals. Mutexes are good when you want to make sure you're the only one doing something. Signals are good when you want to make sure someone else has finished doing something. Minimizing shared resources can also help prevent unexpected behaviors Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs. Code which relies heavily on sleeps is prone to race conditions, so first check for calls to sleep in the affected code. Adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events. This can be useful for reproducing the behavior, seeing if you can make it disappear by changing the timing of things, and for testing solutions put in place. The sleeps should be removed after debugging. The signature sign that one has a race condition though, is if there's an issue that only occurs intermittently on some machines. Common bugs would be crashes and deadlocks. With logging, you should be able to find the affected area and work back from there.","A race condition occurs in multi-threaded or multi-process systems when assumptions are made about the order of events between threads or processes without ensuring synchronization.

This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access. Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals. Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs."

34510,34745,What is a race condition?,"A ""race condition"" exists when multithreaded (or otherwise parallel) code that would access a shared resource could do so in such a way as to cause unexpected results. Take this example: If you had 5 threads executing this code at once, the value of x WOULD NOT end up being 50,000,000. It would in fact vary with each run. This is because, in order for each thread to increment the value of x, they have to do the following: (simplified, obviously) Any thread can be at any step in this process at any time, and they can step on each other when a shared resource is involved. The state of x can be changed by another thread during the time between x is being read and when it is written back. Let's say a thread retrieves the value of x, but hasn't stored it yet. Another thread can also retrieve the same value of x (because no thread has changed it yet) and then they would both be storing the same value (x+1) back in x! Example: Race conditions can be avoided by employing some sort of locking mechanism before the code that accesses the shared resource: Here, the answer comes out as 50,000,000 every time. For more on locking, search for: mutex, semaphore, critical section, shared resource.","A race condition occurs when multithreaded code accessing a shared resource causes unexpected results due to concurrent modifications. This can be illustrated by incrementing a shared variable `x` across multiple threads, where the result is unpredictable due to overlapping reads and writes.","A ""race condition"" exists when multithreaded (or otherwise parallel) code that would access a shared resource could do so in such a way as to cause unexpected results.

In contrast, the IAE JavaDoc couldn't be more clear: ""Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument."" Yup, that's you! Second, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume? Probably that someone dereferenced a <code>null</code>. When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value. Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading. Third, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead? Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE's separately from IAE and do something different as a result? Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message? But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters.

62814,63084,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"The answer may depend on the target OS. For example, at least one RTOS implementation I'm familiar with will allow multiple sequential ""get"" operations against a single OS mutex, so long as they're all from within the same thread context. The multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex.

The idea behind this type of mutex is that you protect an object by only allowing a single context to modify the data at a time. Even if the thread gets the mutex and then calls a function that further modifies the object (and gets/puts the protector mutex around its own operations), the operations should still be safe because they're all happening under a single thread. Of course, when using this feature, you must be certain that all accesses within a single thread really are safe!

75191,75238,What is an unsigned char?,"This is implementation dependent, as the C standard does NOT define the signed-ness of <code>char</code>. Depending on the platform, char may be <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>, so you need to explicitly ask for <code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code> if your implementation depends on it. Just use <code>char</code> if you intend to represent characters from strings, as this will match what your platform puts in the string. The difference between <code>signed char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code> is as you'd expect. On most platforms, <code>signed char</code> will be an 8-bit two's complement number ranging from <code>-128</code> to <code>127</code>, and <code>unsigned char</code> will be an 8-bit unsigned integer (<code>0</code> to <code>255</code>). Note the standard does NOT require that <code>char</code> types have 8 bits, only that <code>sizeof(char)</code> return <code>1</code>.

It is common to see an RGB (or RGBA) colour represented as 24 (or 32) bits, each an unsigned char. Since unsigned char values fall in the range [0,255], the values are typically interpreted as 0 meaning a total lack of a given colour component 255 meaning 100% of a given colour pigment So you would end up with RGB red as (255,0,0) -> (100% red, 0% green, 0% blue). Why not use a signed char? Arithmetic and bit shifting becomes problematic. As explained already, a signed char's range is essentially shifted by -128. A very simple and naive (mostly unused) method for converting RGB to grayscale is to average all three colour components, but this runs into problems when the values of the colour components are negative. Red (255, 0, 0) averages to (85, 85, 85) when using unsigned char arithmetic.

While both types of semaphores have a full/empty state and use the same API, their usage is very different. Mutual Exclusion Semaphores Mutual Exclusion semaphores are used to protect shared resources (data structure, file, etc..). A Mutex semaphore is ""owned"" by the task that takes it. If Task B attempts to semGive a mutex currently held by Task A, Task B's call will return an error and fail. Mutexes always use the following sequence: Here is a simple example: Binary Semaphore Binary Semaphore address a totally different question: Task B is pended waiting for something to happen (a sensor being tripped for example). Sensor Trips and an Interrupt Service Routine runs. It needs to notify a task of the trip. Task B should run and take appropriate actions for the sensor trip. Then go back to waiting. Note that with a binary semaphore, it is OK for B to take the semaphore and A to give it. Again, a binary semaphore is NOT protecting a resource from access.

It typically makes little sense for the same task to so a give and a take on the same binary semaphore.","Binary semaphores and mutexes are distinct synchronization primitives used for different purposes.

86049,86052,How do I ignore files in Subversion?,"(This answer has been updated to match SVN 1.8 and 1.9's behaviour) You have 2 questions: Marking files as ignored: By ""ignored file"" I mean the file won't appear in lists even as ""unversioned"": your SVN client will pretend the file doesn't exist at all in the filesystem. Ignored files are specified by a ""file pattern"". The syntax and format of file patterns is explained in SVN's online documentation: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.special.ignore.html ""File Patterns in Subversion"". Subversion, as of version 1.8 (June 2013) and later, supports 3 different ways of specifying file patterns. Here's a summary with examples: 1 - Runtime Configuration Area - <code>global-ignores</code> option: This is a client-side only setting, so your <code>global-ignores</code> list won't be shared by other users, and it applies to all repos you checkout onto your computer. This setting is defined in your Runtime Configuration Area file: Windows (file-based) - <code>C:\Users\{you}\AppData\Roaming\Subversion\config</code> Windows (registry-based) - <code>Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\global-ignores</code> in both <code>HKLM</code> and <code>HKCU</code>. Linux/Unix - <code>~/.subversion/config</code> 2 - The <code>svn:ignore</code> property, which is set on directories (not files): This is stored within the repo, so other users will have the same ignore files. Similar to how <code>.gitignore</code> works. <code>svn:ignore</code> is applied to directories and is non-recursive or inherited. Any file or immediate subdirectory of the parent directory that matches the File Pattern will be excluded. While SVN 1.8 adds the concept of ""inherited properties"", the <code>svn:ignore</code> property itself is ignored in non-immediate descendant directories: (So the file <code>./subdirectory/ignoreThis</code> is not ignored, even though ""<code>ignoreThis.txt</code>"" is applied on the <code>.</code> repo root). Therefore, to apply an ignore list recursively you must use <code>svn propset svn:ignore &lt;filePattern&gt; . --recursive</code>. This will create a copy of the property on every subdirectory. If the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> value is different in a child directory then the child's value completely overrides the parents, so there is no ""additive"" effect. So if you change the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> on the root <code>.</code>, then you must change it with <code>--recursive</code> to overwrite it on the child and descendant directories. I note that the command-line syntax is counter-intuitive. I started-off assuming that you would ignore a file in SVN by typing something like <code>svn ignore pathToFileToIgnore.txt</code> however this is not how SVN's ignore feature works. 3- The <code>svn:global-ignores</code> property. Requires SVN 1.8 (June 2013): This is similar to <code>svn:ignore</code>, except it makes use of SVN 1.8's ""inherited properties"" feature. Compare to <code>svn:ignore</code>, the file pattern is automatically applied in every descendant directory (not just immediate children). This means that is unnecessary to set <code>svn:global-ignores</code> with the <code>--recursive</code> flag, as inherited ignore file patterns are automatically applied as they're inherited. Running the same set of commands as in the previous example, but using <code>svn:global-ignores</code> instead: For TortoiseSVN users: This whole arrangement was confusing for me, because TortoiseSVN's terminology (as used in their Windows Explorer menu system) was initially misleading to me - I was unsure what the significance of the Ignore menu's ""Add  recursively"", ""Add *"" and ""Add "" options. I hope this post explains how the Ignore feature ties-in to the SVN Properties feature. That said, I suggest using the command-line to set ignored files so you get a feel for how it works instead of using the GUI, and only using the GUI to manipulate properties after you're comfortable with the command-line. Listing files that are ignored: The command <code>svn status</code> will hide ignored files (that is, files that match an RGA <code>global-ignores</code> pattern, or match an immediate parent directory's <code>svn:ignore</code> pattern or match any ancesor directory's <code>svn:global-ignores</code> pattern. Use the <code>--no-ignore</code> option to see those files listed. Ignored files have a status of <code>I</code>, then pipe the output to <code>grep</code> to only show lines starting with ""I"". The command is: For example: ta-da!","To ignore files in Subversion, there are three methods: 

1. Runtime Configuration Area - use the `global-ignores` option in your SVN client's configuration file, which applies to all repositories on your computer.
2. Set the `svn:ignore` property on directories, which is stored in the repository and applies to immediate subdirectories. To apply recursively, use `svn propset svn:ignore <filePattern> . --recursive`.
3. Use the `svn:global-ignores` property (SVN 1.8 and later), which applies to all descendant directories and doesn't require the `--recursive` flag.

To list ignored files, use `svn status --no-ignore`, then pipe the output to `grep` to show only lines starting with ""I"".",Marking files as ignored: 1 - Runtime Configuration Area - <code>global-ignores</code> option: This setting is defined in your Runtime Configuration Area file:,"Subversion, as of version 1.8 (June 2013) and later, supports 3 different ways of specifying file patterns.

Materialized views are similar to regular views, in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement), however, the underlying query resultset has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view, you are querying a table, which may also be indexed. In addition, because all the joins have been resolved at materialized view refresh time, you pay the price of the join once (or as often as you refresh your materialized view), rather than each time you select from the materialized view. In addition, with query rewrite enabled, Oracle can optimize a query that selects from the source of your materialized view in such a way that it instead reads from your materialized view. In situations where you create materialized views as forms of aggregate tables, or as copies of frequently executed queries, this can greatly speed up the response time of your end user application. The downside though is that the data you get back from the materialized view is only as up to date as the last time the materialized view has been refreshed. Materialized views can be set to refresh manually, on a set schedule, or based on the database detecting a change in data from one of the underlying tables. Materialized views can be incrementally updated by combining them with materialized view logs, which act as change data capture sources on the underlying tables. Materialized views are most often used in data warehousing / business intelligence applications where querying large fact tables with thousands of millions of rows would result in query response times that resulted in an unusable application.","Views evaluate underlying table data at query time, offering the latest data but potentially poor performance due to complex queries.

It doesn't care what it publishes, but it needs a mapper to take something from a record to a message. I wrote it once, but now I can inject many types into this set of code if I publish different types of messages. I can also write mappers that take a record of the same type and map them to different messages. Using DI with Generics has given me the ability to write very little code to accomplish many tasks.

100003,100146,What are metaclasses in Python?,"A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves, a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows), the more useful approach is actually to make it an actual class itself. <code>type</code> is the usual metaclass in Python. In case you're wondering, yes, <code>type</code> is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won't be able to recreate something like <code>type</code> purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass <code>type</code>. A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. Like you create an instance of the class by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the 'class' statement) by calling the metaclass. Combined with the normal <code>__init__</code> and <code>__new__</code> methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to do 'extra things' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry, or even replace the class with something else entirely. When the <code>class</code> statement is executed, Python first executes the body of the <code>class</code> statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the <code>__metaclass__</code> attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the <code>__metaclass__</code> global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name, bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it. However, metaclasses actually define the <em>type</em> of a class, not just a factory for it, so you can do much more with them. You can, for instance, define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods, in that they can be called on the class without an instance, but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. <code>type.__subclasses__()</code> is an example of a method on the <code>type</code> metaclass. You can also define the normal 'magic' methods, like <code>__add__</code>, <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__getattr__</code>, to implement or change how the class behaves. Here's an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:","A metaclass is the class of a class, defining how a class behaves. In Python, the usual metaclass is `type`.

2056,101561,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Model-View-Presenter In MVP, the Presenter contains the UI business logic for the View. All invocations from the View delegate directly to Presenter. The Presenter is also decoupled directly from the View and talks to it through an interface. This is to allow mocking of the View in a unit test. One common attribute of MVP is that there has to be a lot of two-way dispatching. For example, when someone clicks the ""Save"" button, the event handler delegates to the Presenter's ""OnSave"" method. Once the save is completed, the Presenter will then call back the View through its interface so that the View can display that the save has completed. MVP tends to be a very natural pattern for achieving separated presentation in Web Forms. The reason is that the View is always created first by the ASP.NET runtime. You can find out more about both variants. Two primary variations Passive View: The View is as dumb as possible and contains almost zero logic. The Presenter is a middle man that talks to the View and the Model. The View and Model are completely shielded from one another. The Model may raise events, but the Presenter subscribes to them for updating the View. In Passive View there is no direct data binding, instead the View exposes setter properties which the Presenter uses to set the data. All state is managed in the Presenter and not the View. Pro: maximum testability surface; clean separation of the View and Model Con: more work (for example all the setter properties) as you are doing all the data binding yourself. Supervising Controller: The Presenter handles user gestures. The View binds to the Model directly through data binding. In this case it's the Presenter's job to pass off the Model to the View so that it can bind to it. The Presenter will also contain logic for gestures like pressing a button, navigation, etc. Pro: by leveraging databinding the amount of code is reduced. Con: there's less testable surface (because of data binding), and there's less encapsulation in the View since it talks directly to the Model. Model-View-Controller In the MVC, the Controller is responsible for determining which View to display in response to any action including when the application loads. This differs from MVP where actions route through the View to the Presenter. In MVC, every action in the View correlates with a call to a Controller along with an action. In the web each action involves a call to a URL on the other side of which there is a Controller who responds. Once that Controller has completed its processing, it will return the correct View. The sequence continues in that manner throughout the life of the application: One other big difference about MVC is that the View does not directly bind to the Model. The view simply renders, and is completely stateless. In implementations of MVC the View usually will not have any logic in the code behind. This is contrary to MVP where it is absolutely necessary because, if the View does not delegate to the Presenter, it will never get called. Presentation Model One other pattern to look at is the Presentation Model pattern. In this pattern there is no Presenter. Instead the View binds directly to a Presentation Model. The Presentation Model is a Model crafted specifically for the View. This means this Model can expose properties that one would never put on a domain model as it would be a violation of separation-of-concerns. In this case, the Presentation Model binds to the domain model, and may subscribe to events coming from that Model. The View then subscribes to events coming from the Presentation Model and updates itself accordingly. The Presentation Model can expose commands which the view uses for invoking actions. The advantage of this approach is that you can essentially remove the code-behind altogether as the PM completely encapsulates all of the behaviour for the view. This pattern is a very strong candidate for use in WPF applications and is also called Model-View-ViewModel. There is a MSDN article about the Presentation Model and a section in the Composite Application Guidance for WPF (former Prism) about Separated Presentation Patterns","MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are presentation patterns that separate domain objects, UI, and behavior. The key difference is that in MVC, the Model updates the View directly, whereas in MVP, the Presenter acts as an intermediary between the View and Model.

MVP variants include:
- Passive View: View is dumb, Presenter talks to View and Model, and all state is managed in the Presenter.
- Supervising Controller: Presenter handles user gestures and passes off the Model to the View for data binding.

MVC involves the Controller determining which View to display in response to actions, and the View is stateless, rendering only, without logic in the code behind. 

Presentation Model is another pattern where the View binds directly to a Presentation Model, which binds to the domain Model, allowing for removal of code-behind and encapsulation of behavior.",The Presenter is a middle man that talks to the View and the Model.

106508,106568,What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer In computer science, a smart pointer   is an abstract data type that   simulates a pointer while providing   additional features, such as automatic   garbage collection or bounds checking.   These additional features are intended   to reduce bugs caused by the misuse of   pointers while retaining efficiency.   Smart pointers typically keep track of   the objects that point to them for the   purpose of memory management. The   misuse of pointers is a major source   of bugs: the constant allocation,   deallocation and referencing that must   be performed by a program written   using pointers makes it very likely   that some memory leaks will occur.   Smart pointers try to prevent memory   leaks by making the resource   deallocation automatic: when the   pointer to an object (or the last in a   series of pointers) is destroyed, for   example because it goes out of scope,   the pointed object is destroyed too.","A smart pointer is an abstract data type that simulates a pointer with additional features like automatic garbage collection or bounds checking to reduce bugs caused by pointer misuse.

106508,106614,What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?,"A smart pointer is a class that wraps a 'raw' (or 'bare') C++ pointer, to manage the lifetime of the object being pointed to. There is no single smart pointer type, but all of them try to abstract a raw pointer in a practical way. Smart pointers should be preferred over raw pointers. If you feel you need to use pointers (first consider if you really do), you would normally want to use a smart pointer as this can alleviate many of the problems with raw pointers, mainly forgetting to delete the object and leaking memory. With raw pointers, the programmer has to explicitly destroy the object when it is no longer useful. A smart pointer by comparison defines a policy as to when the object is destroyed. You still have to create the object, but you no longer have to worry about destroying it. The simplest policy in use involves the scope of the smart pointer wrapper object, such as implemented by <code>boost::scoped_ptr</code> or <code>std::unique_ptr</code>. Note that <code>scoped_ptr</code> instances cannot be copied. This prevents the pointer from being deleted multiple times (incorrectly). You can, however, pass references to it around to other functions you call. Scoped pointers are useful when you want to tie the lifetime of the object to a particular block of code, or if you embedded it as member data inside another object, the lifetime of that other object. The object exists until the containing block of code is exited, or until the containing object is itself destroyed. A more complex smart pointer policy involves reference counting the pointer. This does allow the pointer to be copied. When the last ""reference"" to the object is destroyed, the object is deleted. This policy is implemented by <code>boost::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code>. Reference counted pointers are very useful when the lifetime of your object is much more complicated, and is not tied directly to a particular section of code or to another object. There is one drawback to reference counted pointers Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?the possibility of creating a dangling reference: Another possibility is creating circular references: To work around this problem, both Boost and C++11 have defined a <code>weak_ptr</code> to define a weak (uncounted) reference to a <code>shared_ptr</code>. UPDATE This answer is rather old, and so describes what was 'good' at the time, which was smart pointers provided by the Boost library. Since C++11, the standard library has provided sufficient smart pointers types, and so you should favour the use of <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, <code>std::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::weak_ptr</code>. There is also <code>std::auto_ptr</code>. It is very much like a scoped pointer, except that it also has the ""special"" dangerous ability to be copied Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?which also unexpectedly transfers ownership! It is deprecated in the newest standards, so you shouldn't use it. Use the <code>std::unique_ptr</code> instead.","Smart pointers abstract a raw C++ pointer, managing the object's lifetime. They abstract the need to manually delete objects, preventing memory leaks. Two main types exist: 

- `std::unique_ptr` (and `boost::scoped_ptr`): tied to the scope of the object, cannot be copied, useful for short-lived objects.

109023,109025,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"This is known as the 'Hamming Weight', 'popcount' or 'sideways addition'. The 'best' algorithm really depends on which CPU you are on and what your usage pattern is. Some CPUs have a single built-in instruction to do it and others have parallel instructions which act on bit vectors. The parallel instructions (like x86's <code>popcnt</code>, on CPUs where it's supported) will almost certainly be fastest. Some other architectures may have a slow instruction implemented with a microcoded loop that tests a bit per cycle (citation needed). A pre-populated table lookup method can be very fast if your CPU has a large cache and/or you are doing lots of these instructions in a tight loop. However it can suffer because of the expense of a 'cache miss', where the CPU has to fetch some of the table from main memory. If you know that your bytes will be mostly 0's or mostly 1's then there are very efficient algorithms for these scenarios. I believe a very good general purpose algorithm is the following, known as 'parallel' or 'variable-precision SWAR algorithm'. I have expressed this in a C-like pseudo language, you may need to adjust it to work for a particular language (e.g. using uint32_t for C++ and >>> in Java): This has the best worst-case behaviour of any of the algorithms discussed, so will efficiently deal with any usage pattern or values you throw at it. This bitwise-SWAR algorithm could parallelize to be done in multiple vector elements at once, instead of in a single integer register, for a speedup on CPUs with SIMD but no usable popcount instruction. (e.g. x86-64 code that has to run on any CPU, not just Nehalem or later.) However, the best way to use vector instructions for popcount is usually by using a variable-shuffle to do a table-lookup for 4 bits at a time of each byte in parallel. (The 4 bits index a 16 entry table held in a vector register). On Intel CPUs, the hardware 64bit popcnt instruction can outperform an SSSE3 <code>PSHUFB</code> bit-parallel implementation by about a factor of 2, but only if your compiler gets it just right. Otherwise SSE can come out significantly ahead. Newer compiler versions are aware of the popcnt false dependency problem on Intel.

On the GNU compiler for example you can just use: In the worst case the compiler will generate a call to a function. In the best case the compiler will emit a cpu instruction to do the same job faster. The GCC intrinsics even work across multiple platforms. Popcount will become mainstream in the x86 architecture, so it makes sense to start using the intrinsic now. Other architectures have the popcount for years. On x86, you can tell the compiler that it can assume support for <code>popcnt</code> instruction with <code>-mpopcnt</code> or <code>-msse4.2</code> to also enable the vector instructions that were added in the same generation. See GCC x86 options. <code>-march=nehalem</code> (or <code>-march=</code> whatever CPU you want your code to assume and to tune for) could be a good choice. Running the resulting binary on an older CPU will result in an illegal-instruction fault. To make binaries optimized for the machine you build them on, use <code>-march=native</code>  (with gcc, clang, or ICC). MSVC provides an intrinsic for the x86 <code>popcnt</code> instruction, but unlike gcc it's really an intrinsic for the hardware instruction and requires hardware support. Using <code>std::bitset&lt;&gt;::count()</code> instead of a built-in In theory, any compiler that knows how to popcount efficiently for the target CPU should expose that functionality through ISO C++ <code>std::bitset&lt;&gt;</code>. In practice, you might be better off with the bit-hack AND/shift/ADD in some cases for some target CPUs. For target architectures where hardware popcount is an optional extension (like x86), not all compilers have a <code>std::bitset</code> that takes advantage of it when available. For example, MSVC has no way to enable <code>popcnt</code> support at compile time, and always uses a table lookup, even with <code>/Ox /arch:AVX</code> (which implies SSE4.2, although technically there is a separate feature bit for <code>popcnt</code>.) But at least you get something portable that works everywhere, and with gcc/clang with the right target options, you get hardware popcount for architectures that support it. See asm from gcc, clang, icc, and MSVC on the Godbolt compiler explorer. x86-64 <code>gcc -O3 -std=gnu++11 -mpopcnt</code> emits this: PowerPC64 <code>gcc -O3 -std=gnu++11</code> emits (for the <code>int</code> arg version): This source isn't x86-specific or GNU-specific at all, but only compiles well for x86 with gcc/clang/icc. Also note that gcc's fallback for architectures without single-instruction popcount is a byte-at-a-time table lookup. This isn't wonderful for ARM, for example.","To count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer, use the built-in functions of your compiler, such as GCC's `<code>popcnt</code>` instruction, which can be enabled with flags like `-mpopcnt` or `-msse4.2`.

That means that in MVP standard web form page life cycle is just enhanced by extracting the business logic from code behind. In other words, page is the one servicing http request. In other words, MVP IMHO is web form evolutionary type of enhancement. MVC on other hand changes completely the game because the request gets intercepted by controller class before page is loaded, the business logic is executed there and then at the end result of controller processing the data just dumped to the page (""view"") In that sense, MVC looks (at least to me) a lot to Supervising Controller flavor of MVP enhanced with routing engine Both of them enable TDD and have downsides and upsides. Decision on how to choose one of them IMHO should be based on how much time one invested in ASP NET web form type of web development.

This is a slight variation on Jon's comments. First add this interface to your codebase. Its implementers can answer when a certain predicate is true of a certain type. E.g. If <code>T</code> were <code>User</code> and <code>AuthorizedUserPredicate&lt;User&gt;</code> implements <code>IPredicate&lt;T&gt;</code>, then <code>AuthorizedUserPredicate#apply</code> returns whether the passed in <code>User</code> is authorized.

The domain object that has the target collection would have filtering logic for the methods that initialize, add and set the target collection.

The following example looks for missing objects between collections: The following example, looks for an instance in a collection, and returns the first element of the collection as default value when the instance is not found: UPDATE (after Java 8 release): It's been several years since I (Alan) first posted this answer, and I still cannot believe I am collecting SO points for this answer.

129329,129397,Optimistic vs. Pessimistic locking,"Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, take note of a version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or checksums/hashes) and check that the version hasn't changed before you write the record back. When you write the record back you filter the update on the version to make sure it's atomic. (i.e. hasn't been updated between when you check the version and write the record to the disk) and update the version in one hit. If the record is dirty (i.e. different version to yours) you abort the transaction and the user can re-start it. This strategy is most applicable to high-volume systems and three-tier architectures where you do not necessarily maintain a connection to the database for your session. In this situation the client cannot actually maintain database locks as the connections are taken from a pool and you may not be using the same connection from one access to the next. Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it. It has much better integrity than optimistic locking but requires you to be careful with your application design to avoid Deadlocks. To use pessimistic locking you need either a direct connection to the database (as would typically be the case in a two tier client server application) or an externally available transaction ID that can be used independently of the connection. In the latter case you open the transaction with the TxID and then reconnect using that ID. The DBMS maintains the locks and allows you to pick the session back up through the TxID. This is how distributed transactions using two-phase commit protocols (such as XA or COM+ Transactions) work.","Optimistic Locking checks a record's version number before updating, ensuring the version hasn't changed, and aborts the transaction if it has. Pessimistic Locking locks the record exclusively until finished, providing better integrity but risking deadlocks, requiring a direct connection or an externally available transaction ID.","Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, take note of a version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or checksums/hashes) and check that the version hasn't changed before you write the record back.

The problem is that the pattern is often used by people developing software with object-oriented tools without having a solid grasp of OO concepts.

141525,141576,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"Let's say we have a single byte: Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte. The bits don't rollover; they are discarded. That means if you left shift 1101100 and then right shift it, you won't get the same result back. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N. Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2N and rounding to zero. Bitshifting can be used for insanely fast multiplication and division, provided you are working with a power of 2. Almost all low-level graphics routines use bitshifting. For example, way back in the olden days, we used mode 13h (320x200 256 colors) for games. In Mode 13h, the video memory was laid out sequentially per pixel. That meant to calculate the location for a pixel, you would use the following math: Now, back in that day and age, speed was critical, so we would use bitshifts to do this operation. However, 320 is not a power of two, so to get around this we have to find out what is a power of two that added together makes 320: Now we can convert that into left shifts: For a final result of: Now we get the same offset as before, except instead of an expensive multiplication operation, we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this (note, it's been forever since I've done assembly (editor's note: corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example)): Total: 28 cycles on whatever ancient CPU had these timings. Vrs 12 cycles on the same ancient CPU. Yes, we would work this hard to shave off 16 CPU cycles. In 32 or 64-bit mode, both versions get a lot shorter and faster. Modern out-of-order execution CPUs like Intel Skylake (see http://agner.org/optimize/) have very fast hardware multiply (low latency and high throughput), so the gain is much smaller. AMD Bulldozer-family is a bit slower, especially for 64-bit multiply. On Intel CPUs, and AMD Ryzen, two shifts are slightly lower latency but more instructions than a multiply (which may lead to lower throughput): vs. Compilers will do this for you: See how gcc, clang, and MSVC all use shift+lea when optimizing <code>return 320*row + col;</code>. The most interesting thing to note here is that x86 has a shift-and-add instruction (<code>LEA</code>) that can do small left shifts and add at the same time, with the performance as and <code>add</code> instruction. ARM is even more powerful: one operand of any instruction can be left or right shifted for free. So scaling by a compile-time-constant that's known to be a power-of-2 can be even more efficient than a multiply. OK, back in the modern days... something more useful now would be to use bitshifting to store two 8-bit values in a 16-bit integer. For example, in C#: In C++, compilers should do this for you if you used a <code>struct</code> with two 8-bit members, but in practice don't always.",,,"Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte.

141525,141873,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"The bit shifting operators do exactly what their name implies. They shift bits. Here's a brief (or not-so-brief) introduction to the different shift operators. The Operators <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the left shift operator, and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts. All of these operators can be applied to integer values (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, possibly <code>short</code> and <code>byte</code> or <code>char</code>). In some languages, applying the shift operators to any datatype smaller than <code>int</code> automatically resizes the operand to be an <code>int</code>. Note that <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> is not an operator, because it would be redundant. Also note that C and C++ do not distinguish between the right shift operators. They provide only the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator, and the right-shifting behavior is implementation defined for signed types. Left shift (&lt;&lt;) Integers are stored, in memory, as a series of bits. For example, the number 6 stored as a 32-bit <code>int</code> would be: Shifting this bit pattern to the left one position (<code>6 &lt;&lt; 1</code>) would result in the number 12: As you can see, the digits have shifted to the left by one position, and the last digit on the right is filled with a zero. You might also note that shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2. So <code>6 &lt;&lt; 1</code> is equivalent to <code>6 * 2</code>, and <code>6 &lt;&lt; 3</code> is equivalent to <code>6 * 8</code>. A good optimizing compiler will replace multiplications with shifts when possible. Non-circular shifting Please note that these are <em>not</em> circular shifts. Shifting this value to the left by one position (<code>3,758,096,384 &lt;&lt; 1</code>): results in 3,221,225,472: The digit that gets shifted ""off the end"" is lost. It does not wrap around. Logical right shift (>>>) A logical right shift is the converse to the left shift. Rather than moving bits to the left, they simply move to the right. For example, shifting the number 12: to the right by one position (<code>12 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1</code>) will get back our original 6: So we see that shifting to the right is equivalent to division by powers of 2. Lost bits are gone However, a shift cannot reclaim ""lost"" bits. For example, if we shift this pattern: to the left 4 positions (<code>939,524,102 &lt;&lt; 4</code>), we get 2,147,483,744: and then shifting back (<code>(939,524,102 &lt;&lt; 4) &gt;&gt;&gt; 4</code>) we get 134,217,734: We cannot get back our original value once we have lost bits. Arithmetic right shift (>>) The arithmetic right shift is exactly like the logical right shift, except instead of padding with zero, it pads with the most significant bit. This is because the most significant bit is the <em>sign</em> bit, or the bit that distinguishes positive and negative numbers. By padding with the most significant bit, the arithmetic right shift is sign-preserving. For example, if we interpret this bit pattern as a negative number: we have the number -2,147,483,552. Shifting this to the right 4 positions with the arithmetic shift (-2,147,483,552 >> 4) would give us: or the number -134,217,722. So we see that we have preserved the sign of our negative numbers by using the arithmetic right shift, rather than the logical right shift. And once again, we see that we are performing division by powers of 2.","Bitwise shift operators in programming languages shift bits in a binary number. The main operators are:
- `>>` (arithmetic right shift), which shifts bits to the right and fills the leftmost bits with the most significant bit (sign bit).
- `>>>` (logical right shift), which shifts bits to the right and fills the leftmost bits with zero.
- `<<` (left shift), which shifts bits to the left and fills the rightmost bits with zero.
These operators can be applied to integer values and are equivalent to multiplication and division by powers of 2.",They shift bits.

141525,142335,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming. If you read a specification for a device or even some binary file formats, you will see bytes, words, and dwords, broken up into non-byte aligned bitfields, which contain various values of interest. Accessing these bit-fields for reading/writing is the most common usage. A simple real example in graphics programming is that a 16-bit pixel is represented as follows: To get at the green value you would do this: <strong>Explanation</strong> In order to obtain the value of green ONLY, which starts at offset 5 and ends at 10 (i.e. 6-bits long), you need to use a (bit) mask, which when applied against the entire 16-bit pixel, will yield only the bits we are interested in. The appropriate mask is 0x7E0 which in binary is 0000011111100000 (which is 2016 in decimal). To apply a mask, you use the AND operator (&amp;). After applying the mask, you'll end up with a 16-bit number which is really just a 11-bit number since its MSB is in the 11th bit. Green is actually only 6-bits long, so we need to scale it down using a right shift (11 - 6 = 5), hence the use of 5 as offset (<code>#define GREEN_OFFSET  5</code>). Also common is using bit shifts for fast multiplication and division by powers of 2:",,,"Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming.

148747,148852,What is the difference between a framework and a library?,"Actually these terms can mean a lot of different things depending the context they are used. For example, on Mac OS X frameworks are just libraries, packed into a bundle. Within the bundle you will find an actual dynamic library (libWhatever.dylib). The difference between a bare library and the framework on Mac is that a framework can contain multiple different versions of the library. It can contain extra resources (images, localized strings, XML data files, UI objects, etc.) and unless the framework is released to public, it usually contains the necessary .h files you need to use the library. Thus you have everything within a single package you need to use the library in your application (a C/C++/Objective-C library without .h files is pretty useless, unless you write them yourself according to some library documentation), instead of a bunch of files to move around (a Mac bundle is just a directory on the Unix level, but the UI treats it like a single file, pretty much like you have JAR files in Java and when you click it, you usually don't see what's inside, unless you explicitly select to show the content). Wikipedia calls framework a ""buzzword"". It defines a software framework as A software framework is a re-usable  design for a software system (or  subsystem). A software framework may  include support programs, code  libraries, a scripting language, or  other software to help develop and  glue together the different components  of a software project. Various parts  of the framework may be exposed  through an API.. So I'd say a library is just that, ""a library"". It is a collection of objects/functions/methods (depending on your language) and your application ""links"" against it and thus can use the objects/functions/methods. It is basically a file containing re-usable code that can usually be shared among multiple applications (you don't have to write the same code over and over again). A framework can be everything you use in application development. It can be a library, a collection of many libraries, a collection of scripts, or any piece of software you need to create your application. Framework is just a very vague term. Here's an article about some guy regarding the topic ""Library vs. Framework"". I personally think this article is highly arguable. It's not wrong what he's saying there, however, he's just picking out one of the multiple definitions of framework and compares that to the classic definition of library. E.g. he says you need a framework for sub-classing. Really? I can have an object defined in a library, I can link against it, and sub-class it in my code. I don't see how I need a ""framework"" for that. In some way he rather explains how the term framework is used nowadays. It's just a hyped word, as I said before. Some companies release just a normal library (in any sense of a classical library) and call it a ""framework"" because it sounds more fancy.","A software framework is a reusable design for a software system, including support programs, libraries, scripting languages, or other software to develop and glue together project components.

154577,154673,Polymorphism vs Overriding vs Overloading,"<strong>Polymorphism</strong> is the ability of a class instance to behave as if it were an instance of another class in its inheritance tree, most often one of its ancestor classes. For example, in Java all classes inherit from Object. Therefore, you can create a variable of type Object and assign to it an instance of any class. An <strong>override</strong> is a type of function which occurs in a class which inherits from another class. An override function ""replaces"" a function inherited from the base class, but does so in such a way that it is called even when an instance of its class is pretending to be a different type through polymorphism. Referring to the previous example, you could define your own class and override the toString() function. Because this function is inherited from Object, it will still be available if you copy an instance of this class into an Object-type variable. Normally, if you call toString() on your class while it is pretending to be an Object, the version of toString which will actually fire is the one defined on Object itself. However, because the function is an override, the definition of toString() from your class is used even when the class instance's true type is hidden behind polymorphism. <strong>Overloading</strong> is the action of defining multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters. It is unrelated to either overriding or polymorphism.","Polymorphism is the ability of a class instance to behave as if it were an instance of another class in its inheritance tree.

154577,154675,Polymorphism vs Overriding vs Overloading,"Specifically saying overloading or overriding doesn't give the full picture. Polymorphism is simply the ability of an object to specialize its behavior based on its type. I would disagree with some of the answers here in that overloading is a form of polymorphism (parametric polymorphism) in the case that a method with the same name can behave differently give different parameter types. A good example is operator overloading. You can define ""+"" to accept different types of parameters -- say strings or int's -- and based on those types, ""+"" will behave differently. Polymorphism also includes inheritance and overriding methods, though they can be abstract or virtual in the base type. In terms of inheritance-based polymorphism, Java only supports single class inheritance limiting it polymorphic behavior to that of a single chain of base types.

171952,171961,Is there a destructor for Java?,"Nope, no destructors here. The reason is that all Java objects are heap allocated and garbage collected. Without explicit deallocation (i.e. C++'s delete operator) there is no sensible way to implement real destructors. Java does support finalizers, but they are meant to be used only as a safeguard for objects holding a handle to native resources like sockets, file handles, window handles, etc. When the garbage collector collects an object without a finalizer it simply marks the memory region as free and that's it. When the object has a finalizer, it's first copied into a temporary location (remember, we're garbage collecting here), then it's enqueued into a waiting-to-be-finalized queue and then a Finalizer thread polls the queue with very low priority and runs the finalizer. When the application exits, the JVM stops without waiting for the pending objects to be finalized, so there practically no guarantees that your finalizers will ever run.","Java has no destructor due to its garbage collection mechanism. Instead, it uses finalizers to release native resources like sockets, file handles, or window handles.

171952,172155,Is there a destructor for Java?,"First, note that since Java is garbage-collected, it is rare to need to do anything about object destruction. Firstly because you don't usually have any managed resources to free, and secondly because you can't predict when or if it will happen, so it's inappropriate for things that you need to occur ""as soon as nobody is using my object any more"". You can be notified after an object has been destroyed using java.lang.ref.PhantomReference (actually, saying it has been destroyed may be slightly inaccurate, but if a phantom reference to it is queued then it's no longer recoverable, which usually amounts to the same thing). A common use is: Separate out the resource(s) in your class that need to be destructed into another helper object (note that if all you're doing is closing a connection, which is a common case, you don't need to write a new class: the connection to be closed would be the ""helper object"" in that case). When you create your main object, create also a PhantomReference to it. Either have this refer to the new helper object, or set up a map from PhantomReference objects to their corresponding helper objects. After the main object is collected, the PhantomReference is queued (or rather it may be queued - like finalizers there is no guarantee it ever will be, for example if the VM exits then it won't wait). Make sure you're processing its queue (either in a special thread or from time to time). Because of the hard reference to the helper object, the helper object has not yet been collected. So do whatever cleanup you like on the helper object, then discard the PhantomReference and the helper will eventually be collected too. There is also finalize(), which looks like a destructor but doesn't behave like one. It's usually not a good option.","Java does not have a traditional destructor.

214741,214839,What is a StackOverflowError?,"Stack overflow means exactly that: a stack overflows. Usually there's a one stack in the program that contains local-scope variables and addresses where to return when execution of a routine ends. That stack tends to be a fixed memory range somewhere in the memory, therefore it's limited how much it can contain values. If the stack is empty you can't pop, if you do you'll get stack underflow error. If the stack is full you can't push, if you do you'll get stack overflow error. So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion. Some implementations optimize out some forms of recursions. Tail recursion in particular. Tail recursive routines are form of routines where the recursive call appears as a final thing what the routine does. Such routine call gets simply reduced into a jump. Some implementations go so far as implement their own stacks for recursion, therefore they allow the recursion to continue until the system runs out of memory. Easiest thing you could try would be to increase your stack size if you can. If you can't do that though, the second best thing would be to look whether there's something that clearly causes the stack overflow. Try it by printing something before and after the call into routine. This helps you to find out the failing routine.","A StackOverflowError occurs when a program's stack is filled to capacity, typically due to excessive recursion or large local-scope variable allocation. This can be mitigated by increasing the stack size or identifying the source of the overflow, such as a recursive function.","Stack overflow means exactly that: a stack overflows.

151969,226844,When to use self over $this?,"<code>$this-&gt;</code> is used to refer to a specific instance of a class's variables (member variables) or methods. $derek is now a specific instance of Person.Every Person has a first_name and a last_name, but $derek has a specific first_name and last_name (Derek Martin). Inside the $derek instance, we can refer to those as $this->first_name and $this->last_name ClassName:: is used to refer to that type of class, and its static variables, static methods. If it helps, you can mentally replace the word ""static"" with ""shared"". Because they are shared, they cannot refer to $this, which refers to a specific instance (not shared). Static Variables (i.e. static $db_connection) can be shared among all instances of a type of object. For example, all database objects share a single connection (static $connection). <strong>Static Variables Example:</strong>Pretend we have a database class with a single member variable: static $num_connections;Now, put this in the constructor: Just as objects have constructors, they also have destructors, which are executed when the object dies or is unset: Every time we create a new instance, it will increase our connection counter by one. Every time we destroy or stop using an instance, it will decrease the connection counter by one. In this way, we can monitor the number of instances of the database object we have in use with: Because $num_connections is static (shared), it will reflect the total number of active database objects. You may have seen this technique used to share database connections among all instances of a database class. This is done because creating the database connection takes a long time, so it's best to create just one, and share it (this is called a Singleton Pattern). Static Methods (i.e. public static View::format_phone_number($digits)) can be used WITHOUT first instantiating one of those objects (i.e. They do not internally refer to $this). <strong>Static Method Example:</strong> As you can see, public static function prettyName knows nothing about the object. It's just working with the parameters you pass in, like a normal function that's not part of an object. Why bother, then, if we could just have it not as part of the object? <li>First, attaching functions to objects helps you keep things organized, so you know where to find them. <li>Second, it prevents naming conflicts. In a big project, you're likely to have two developers create getName() functions. If one creates a ClassName1::getName(), and the other creates ClassName2::getName(), it's no problem at all. No conflict. Yay static methods! <strong>SELF::</strong>If you are coding <em>outside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you must call it using the object's name View::format_phone_number($phone_number);If you are coding <em>inside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you can <em>either</em> use the object's name View::format_phone_number($pn), OR you can use the self::format_phone_number($pn)  shortcut The same goes for static variables:<strong>Example:</strong> View::templates_path versus self::templates_path Inside the DB class, if we were referring to a static method of some other object, we would use the object's name:<strong>Example:</strong> Session::getUsersOnline(); But if the DB class wanted to refer to its own static variable, it would just say self:<strong>Example:</strong> self::connection; Hope that helps clear things up :)","In PHP, `$this` refers to a specific instance of a class's variables or methods, while `self` refers to the class itself. `ClassName::` is used to access static variables or methods, which are shared among all instances.

255898,256225,How to iterate over arguments in a Bash script,"Rewrite of a now-deleted answer by VonC. Robert Gamble's succinct answer deals directly with the question. This one amplifies on some issues with filenames containing spaces. See also: ${1:+""$@""} in /bin/sh Basic thesis: <code>""$@""</code> is correct, and <code>$*</code> (unquoted) is almost always wrong. This is because <code>""$@""</code> works fine when arguments contain spaces, and works the same as <code>$*</code> when they don't. In some circumstances, <code>""$*""</code> is OK too, but <code>""$@""</code> usually (but not always) works in the same places. Unquoted, <code>$@</code> and <code>$*</code> are equivalent (and almost always wrong). So, what is the difference between <code>$*</code>, <code>$@</code>, <code>""$*""</code>, and <code>""$@""</code>? They are all related to 'all the arguments to the shell', but they do different things. When unquoted, <code>$*</code> and <code>$@</code> do the same thing. They treat each 'word' (sequence of non-whitespace) as a separate argument. The quoted forms are quite different, though: <code>""$*""</code> treats the argument list as a single space-separated string, whereas <code>""$@""</code> treats the arguments almost exactly as they were when specified on the command line. <code>""$@""</code> expands to nothing at all when there are no positional arguments; <code>""$*""</code> expands to an empty string &mdash; and yes, there's a difference, though it can be hard to perceive it. See more information below, after the introduction of the (non-standard) command <code>al</code>. Secondary thesis: if you need to process arguments with spaces and then pass them on to other commands, then you sometimes need non-standard tools to assist. (Or you should use arrays, carefully: <code>""${array[@]}""</code> behaves analogously to <code>""$@""</code>.) Example: Why doesn't that work? It doesn't work because the shell processes quotes before it expands variables. So, to get the shell to pay attention to the quotes embedded in <code>$var</code>, you have to use <code>eval</code>: This gets really tricky when you have file names such as "" "" (with quotes and double quotes and spaces). The shells (all of them) do not make it particularly easy to handle such stuff, so (funnily enough) many Unix programs do not do a good job of handling them. On Unix, a filename (single component) can contain any characters except slash and NUL <code>'\0'</code>. However, the shells strongly encourage no spaces or newlines or tabs anywhere in a path names. It is also why standard Unix file names do not contain spaces, etc. When dealing with file names that may contain spaces and other troublesome characters, you have to be extremely careful, and I found long ago that I needed a program that is not standard on Unix. I call it <code>escape</code> (version 1.1 was dated 1989-08-23T16:01:45Z). Here is an example of <code>escape</code> in use - with the SCCS control system. It is a cover script that does both a <code>delta</code> (think check-in) and a <code>get</code> (think check-out). Various arguments, especially <code>-y</code> (the reason why you made the change) would contain blanks and newlines. Note that the script dates from 1992, so it uses back-ticks instead of <code>$(cmd ...)</code> notation and does not use <code>#!/bin/sh</code> on the first line. (I would probably not use escape quite so thoroughly these days - it is not needed with the <code>-e</code> argument, for example - but overall, this is one of my simpler scripts using <code>escape</code>.) The <code>escape</code> program simply outputs its arguments, rather like <code>echo</code> does, but it ensures that the arguments are protected for use with <code>eval</code> (one level of <code>eval</code>; I do have a program which did remote shell execution, and that needed to escape the output of <code>escape</code>). I have another program called <code>al</code> that lists its arguments one per line (and it is even more ancient: version 1.1 dated 1987-01-27T14:35:49). It is most useful when debugging scripts, as it can be plugged into a command line to see what arguments are actually passed to the command. [Added: And now to show the difference between the various <code>""$@""</code> notations, here is one more example: Notice that nothing preserves the original blanks between the <code>*</code> and <code>*/*</code> on the command line. Also, note that you can change the 'command line arguments' in the shell by using: This sets 4 options, '<code>-new</code>', '<code>-opt</code>', '<code>and</code>', and '<code>arg with space</code>'. ] Hmm, that's quite a long answer - perhaps exegesis is the better term. Source code for <code>escape</code> available on request (email to firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com). The source code for <code>al</code> is incredibly simple: That's all. It is equivalent to the <code>test.sh</code> script that Robert Gamble showed, and could be written as a shell function (but shell functions didn't exist in the local version of Bourne shell when I first wrote <code>al</code>). Also note that you can write <code>al</code> as a simple shell script: The conditional is needed so that it produces no output when passed no arguments. The <code>printf</code> command will produce a blank line with only the format string argument, but the C program produces nothing.","When iterating over arguments in a Bash script, use <code>""$@""</code> instead of <code>$*</code> to handle arguments with spaces. Unquoted <code>$@</code> and <code>$*</code> are equivalent and usually wrong.

27581,256447,What issues should be considered when overriding equals and hashCode in Java?,"There are some issues worth noticing if you're dealing with classes that are persisted using an Object-Relationship Mapper (ORM) like Hibernate, if you didn't think this was unreasonably complicated already! <strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return <code>false</code>. For example: <em>If you're dealing with an ORM, using <code>o instanceof Person</code> is the only thing that will behave correctly.</em> <strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong> ORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that <code>person.name</code> will be <code>null</code> if <code>person</code> is lazy loaded, even if <code>person.getName()</code> forces loading and returns ""John Doe"". In my experience, this crops up more often in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>. <em>If you're dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>.</em> <strong>Saving an object will change its state</strong> Persistent objects often use a <code>id</code> field to hold the key of the object.

A pattern I often use is But: you cannot include <code>getId()</code> in <code>hashCode()</code>. If you do, when an object is persisted, its <code>hashCode</code> changes. If the object is in a <code>HashSet</code>, you'll ""never"" find it again. In my <code>Person</code> example, I probably would use <code>getName()</code> for <code>hashCode</code> and <code>getId()</code> plus <code>getName()</code> (just for paranoia) for <code>equals()</code>. It's okay if there are some risk of ""collisions"" for <code>hashCode()</code>, but never okay for <code>equals()</code>. <em><code>hashCode()</code> should use the non-changing subset of properties from <code>equals()</code></em>","When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the following issues: 

- Lazy loaded objects are subclasses, so `this.getClass() == o.getClass()` may return false. Use `o instanceof Person` instead.
- Lazy loaded objects have null fields, so use getters instead of field references in equals() and hashCode().
- Persistent objects' state changes when saved, so avoid using an object's id field in hashCode() but it's okay to use it in equals().",<strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> <strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong> But you can use it in <code>equals()</code>.,"<strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store.

214741,307200,What is a StackOverflowError?,"Parameters and local variables are allocated on the stack (with reference types the object lives on the heap and a variable references that object). The stack typically lives at the upper end of your address space and as it is used up it heads towards the bottom of the address space (i.e. towards zero). Your process also has a heap, which lives at the bottom end of your process. As you allocate memory, this heap can grow towards the upper end of your address space. As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to ""collide"" with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!! ). The common cause for a stack overflow is a bad recursive call. Typically, this is caused when your recursive functions doesn't have the correct termination condition, so it ends up calling itself forever. However, with GUI programming, it's possible to generate indirect recursion. For example, your app may be handling paint messages, and, whilst processing them, it may call a function that causes the system to send another paint message. Here you've not explicitly called yourself, but the OS/VM has done it for you. To deal with them, you'll need to examine your code. If you've got functions that call themselves then check that you've got a terminating condition. If you have, then check that when calling the function you have at least modified one of the arguments, otherwise there'll be no visible change for the recursively called function and the terminating condition is useless. If you've got no obvious recursive functions then check to see if you're calling any library functions that indirectly will cause your function to be called (like the implicit case above).","A StackOverflowError occurs when the stack (where parameters and local variables are allocated) collides with the heap (where objects are allocated), typically caused by a bad recursive call without a proper termination condition.","As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to ""collide"" with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!! ).

62814,311648,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"At a theoretical level, they are no different semantically. You can implement a mutex using semaphores or vice versa (see here for an example). In practice, the implementation is different and they offer slightly different services. The practical difference (in terms of the system services surrounding them) is that the implementation of a mutex is aimed at being a more lightweight synchronisation mechanism. In oracle-speak, mutexes are known as latches and semaphores are known as waits. At the lowest level, they use some sort of atomic test and set mechanism. This reads the current value of a memory location, computes some sort of conditional and writes out a value at that location in a single instruction that cannot be interrupted. This means that you can acquire a mutex and test to see if anyone else had it before you. A typical mutex implementation has a process or thread executing the test-and-set instruction and evaluating whether anything else had set the mutex. A key point here is that there is no interaction with the scheduler, so we have no idea (and don't care) who has set the lock. Then we either give up our time slice and attempt it again when the task is re-scheduled or execute a spin-lock. A spin lock is an algorithm like: When we have finished executing our protected code (known as a critical section) we just set the mutex value to zero or whatever means 'clear.' If multiple tasks are attempting to acquire the mutex they the next task that happens to be scheduled after the mutex is released will get access to the resource. Typically you would use mutexes to control a synchronised resource where exclusive access is only needed for very short periods of time, normally to make an update to a shared data structure. A semaphore is a synchronised data structure (typically using a mutex) that has a count and some system call wrappers that interact with the scheduler in a bit more depth than the mutex libraries would. Semaphores are incremented and decremented and used to block tasks until something else is ready. See Producer/Consumer Problem for a simple example of this. Semaphores are initialised to some value - a binary semaphore is just a special case where the semaphore is initialised to 1. Posting to a semaphore has the effect of waking up a waiting process. A basic semaphore algorithm looks like: In the case of a binary semaphore the main practical difference between the two is the nature of the system services surrounding the actual data structure. EDIT: As evan has rightly pointed out, spinlocks will slow down a single processor machine. You would only use a spinlock on a multi-processor box because on a single processor the process holding the mutex will never reset it while another task is running. Spinlocks are only useful on multi-processor architectures.","Binary semaphore and mutex are semantically equivalent but have different implementations and services.

If all toilets are full,   ie. there are no free keys left, the   semaphore count is 0. Now, when eq.   one person leaves the toilet,   semaphore is increased to 1 (one free   key), and given to the next person in   the queue. Officially: ""A semaphore restricts the   number of simultaneous users of a   shared resource up to a maximum   number.

356645,356798,Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.,"It runs successfully the first time,   but if I run it again, I keep getting   a System.OutOfMemoryException. What   are some reasons this could be   happening? Regardless of what the others have said, the error has nothing to do with forgetting to dispose your DBCommand or DBConnection, and you will not fix your error by disposing of either of them. The error has everything to do with your dataset which contains nearly 600,000 rows of data. Apparently your dataset consumes more than 50% of the available memory on your machine. Clearly, you'll run out of memory when you return another dataset of the same size before the first one has been garbage collected. Simple as that. You can remedy this problem in a few ways: Consider returning fewer records. I personally can't imagine a time when returning 600K records has ever been useful to a user. To minimize the records returned, try: Limiting your query to the first 1000 records. If there are more than 1000 results returned from the query, inform the user to narrow their search results. If your users really insist on seeing that much data at once, try paging the data. Remember: Google never shows you all 22 bajillion results of a search at once, it shows you 20 or so records at a time. Google probably doesn't hold all 22 bajillion results in memory at once, it probably finds its more memory efficient to requery its database to generate a new page. If you just need to iterate through the data and you don't need random access, try returning a datareader instead. A datareader only loads one record into memory at a time. If none of those are an option, then you need to force .NET to free up the memory used by the dataset before calling your method using one of these methods: Remove all references to your old dataset. Anything holding on to a refenence of your dataset will prevent it from being reclaimed by memory. If you can't null all the references to your dataset, clear all of the rows from the dataset and any objects bound to those rows instead. This removes references to the datarows and allows them to be eaten by the garbage collector. I don't believe you'll need to call <code>GC.Collect()</code> to force a gen cycle. Not only is it generally a bad idea to call <code>GC.Collect()</code>, because sufficient memory pressure will cause .NET invoke the garbage collector on its own. Note: calling Dispose on your dataset does not free any memory, nor does it invoke the garbage collector, nor does it remove a reference to your dataset. Dispose is used to clean up unmanaged resources, but the DataSet does not have any unmanaged resources. It only implements IDispoable because it inherents from MarshalByValueComponent, so the Dispose method on the dataset is pretty much useless.","A `System.OutOfMemoryException` occurs when the application runs out of memory due to a large dataset consuming over 50% of available memory. To resolve this, consider reducing the amount of data returned by limiting the query to the first 1000 records, paging the data, or using a datareader for iterative access.

224664,366212,Difference between proxy server and reverse proxy server,"The previous answers were accurate, but perhaps too terse. I will try to add some examples. First of all, the word ""proxy"" describes someone or something acting on behalf of someone else. In the computer realm, we are talking about one server acting on the behalf of another computer. For the purposes of accessibility, I will limit my discussion to web proxies - however, the idea of a proxy is not limited to websites. FORWARD proxy Most discussion of web proxies refers to the type of proxy known as a ""forward proxy."" The proxy event, in this case, is that the ""forward proxy"" retrieves data from another web site on behalf of the original requestee. A tale of 3 computers (part I) For an example, I will list three computers connected to the internet. X = your computer, or ""client"" computer on the internet Y = the proxy web site, proxy.example.org Z = the web site you want to visit, www.example.net Normally, one would connect directly from <code>X --&gt; Z.</code> However, in some scenarios, it is better for <code>Y --&gt; Z</code> on behalf of <code>X</code>, which chains as follows: <code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code>. Reasons why X would want to use a forward proxy server: Here is a (very) partial list of uses of a forward proxy server. 1) X is unable to access Z directly because a) Someone with administrative authority over <code>X</code>'s internet connection has decided to block all access to site <code>Z</code>. Examples: The Storm Worm virus is spreading by tricking people into visiting <code>familypostcards2008.com</code>, so the system administrator has blocked access to the site to prevent users from inadvertently infecting themselves. Employees at a large company have been wasting too much time on <code>facebook.com</code>, so management wants access blocked during business hours. A local elementary school disallows internet access to the <code>playboy.com</code> website. A government is unable to control the publishing of news, so it controls access to news instead, by blocking sites such as <code>wikipedia.org</code>. See TOR or FreeNet. b) The administrator of <code>Z</code> has blocked <code>X</code>. Examples: The administrator of Z has noticed hacking attempts coming from X, so the administrator has decided to block X's IP address (and/or netrange). Z is a forum website. <code>X</code> is spamming the forum. Z blocks X. REVERSE proxy A tale of 3 computers (part II) For this example, I will list three computers connected to the internet. X = your computer, or ""client"" computer on the internet Y = the reverse proxy web site, proxy.example.com Z = the web site you want to visit, www.example.net Normally, one would connect directly from <code>X --&gt; Z.</code> However, in some scenarios, it is better for the administrator of <code>Z</code> to restrict or disallow direct access and force visitors to go through Y first. So, as before, we have data being retrieved by <code>Y --&gt; Z</code> on behalf of <code>X</code>, which chains as follows: <code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code>. What is different this time compared to a ""forward proxy,"" is that this time the user <code>X</code> does not know he is accessing <code>Z</code>, because the user <code>X</code> only sees he is communicating with <code>Y</code>. The server <code>Z</code> is invisible to clients and only the reverse proxy <code>Y</code> is visible externally. A reverse proxy requires no (proxy) configuration on the client side. The client <code>X</code> thinks he is only communicating with <code>Y</code> (<code>X --&gt; Y</code>), but the reality is that <code>Y</code> forwarding all communication (<code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code> again). Reasons why Z would want to set up a reverse proxy server: 1) Z wants to force all traffic to its web site to pass through Y first. a) Z has a large web site that millions of people want to see, but a single web server cannot handle all the traffic. So Z sets up many servers and puts a reverse proxy on the internet that will send users to the server closest to them when they try to visit Z. This is part of how the Content Distribution Network (CDN) concept works. Examples: Apple Trailers uses Akamai Jquery.com hosts its javascript files using CloudFront CDN (sample). etc. 2) The administrator of Z is worried about retaliation for content hosted on the server and does not want to expose the main server directly to the public. a) Owners of Spam brands such as ""Canadian Pharmacy"" appear to have thousands of servers, while in reality having most websites hosted on far fewer servers. Additionally, abuse complaints about the spam will only shut down the public servers, not the main server. In the above scenarios, <code>Z</code> has the ability to choose <code>Y</code>.

383692,383699,What is JSON and why would I use it?,"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript). As stated in the MDN, some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript. An example of  where this is used is web services responses. In the 'old' days, web services used XML as their primary data format for transmitting back data, but since JSON appeared (The JSON format is specified in RFC 4627 by Douglas Crockford), it has been the preferred format because it is much more lightweight You can find a lot more info on the official JSON web site. JSON is built on two structures: A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array. An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence. JSON Structure Here is an example of JSON data: JSON in JavaScript JSON (in Javascript) is a string! People often assume all Javascript objects are JSON and that JSON is a Javascript object. This is incorrect. In Javascript <code>var x = {x:y}</code> is not JSON, this is a Javascript object. The two are not the same thing. The JSON equivalent (represented in the Javascript language) would be <code>var x = '{""x"":""y""}'</code>. <code>x</code> is an object of type string not an object in it's own right. To turn this into a fully fledged Javascript object you must first parse it, <code>var x = JSON.parse('{""x"":""y""}');</code>, <code>x</code> is now an object but this is not JSON anymore. See Javascript object Vs JSON When working with JSON and JavaScript, you may be tempted to use the <code>eval</code> function to evaluate the result returned in the callback, but this is not suggested since there are two characters (U+2028 &amp; U+2029) valid in JSON but not in JavaScript (read more of this here). Therefore, one must always try to use Crockford's script that checks for a valid JSON before evaluating it. Link to the script explanation is found here and here is a direct link to the js file. Every major browser nowadays has its own implementation for this. Example on how to use the JSON parser (with the json from the above code snippet): The JSON parser also offers another very useful method, <code>stringify</code>. This method accepts a JavaScript object as a parameter, and outputs back a string with JSON format. This is useful for when you want to send data back to the server: The above two methods (<code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code>) also take a second parameter, which is a function that will be called for every key and value at every level of the final result, and each value will be replaced by result of your inputted function.

Your results may vary, especially because I don't know how the Java factor will play out. My approach is threefold: <li>First, filter out obvious answers. This includes negative numbers and looking at the last 4 bits. (I found looking at the last six didn't help.) I also answer yes for 0. (In reading the code below, note that my input is <code>int64 x</code>. )<code>if( x &lt; 0 || (x&2) || ((x & 7) == 5) || ((x & 11) == 8) )    return false;if( x == 0 )    return true;</code> BIGBLOCK <li>Next, check if it's a square modulo 255 = 3 * 5 * 17. Because that's a product of three distinct primes, only about 1/8 of the residues mod 255 are squares. However, in my experience, calling the modulo operator (%) costs more than the benefit one gets, so I use bit tricks involving 255 = 2^8-1 to compute the residue. (For better or worse, I am not using the trick of reading individual bytes out of a word, only bitwise-and and shifts. )<code>int64 y = x;y = (y & 4294967295LL) + (y &gt;&gt; 32); y = (y & 65535) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);y = (y & 255) + ((y &gt;&gt; 8) & 255) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);// At this point, y is between 0 and 511. More code can reduce it farther. BIGBLOCK </code>To actually check if the residue is a square, I look up the answer in a precomputed table.<code>if( bad255[y] )    return false;// However, I just use a table of size 512</code> BIGBLOCK <li>Finally, try to compute the square root using a method similar to Hensel's lemma. (I don't think it's applicable directly, but it works with some modifications.) Before doing that, I divide out all powers of 2 with a binary search:<code>if((x & 4294967295LL) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 32;if((x & 65535) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 16;if((x & 255) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 8;if((x & 15) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 4;if((x & 3) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 2;</code> BIGBLOCK At this point, for our number to be a square, it must be 1 mod 8.<code>if((x & 7) != 1)    return false;</code> BIGBLOCK The basic structure of Hensel's lemma is the following. (Note: untested code; if it doesn't work, try t=2 or 8. )<code>int64 t = 4, r = 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;// Repeat until t is 2^33 or so. Use a loop if you want.</code> BIGBLOCK The idea is that at each iteration, you add one bit onto r, the ""current"" square root of x; each square root is accurate modulo a larger and larger power of 2, namely t/2. At the end, r and t/2-r will be square roots of x modulo t/2. (Note that if r is a square root of x, then so is -r.  This is true even modulo numbers, but beware, modulo some numbers, things can have even more than 2 square roots; notably, this includes powers of 2.) Because our actual square root is less than 2^32, at that point we can actually just check if r or t/2-r are real square roots. In my actual code, I use the following modified loop:<code>int64 r, t, z;r = start[(x &gt;&gt; 3) & 1023];do {    z = x - r * r;    if( z == 0 )        return true;    if( z &lt; 0 )        return false;    t = z & (-z);    r += (z & t) &gt;&gt; 1;    if( r &gt; (t &gt;&gt; 1) )        r = t - r;} while( t &lt;= (1LL &lt;&lt; 33) );</code> BIGBLOCK The speedup here is obtained in three ways: precomputed start value (equivalent to ~10 iterations of the loop), earlier exit of the loop, and skipping some t values. For the last part, I look at <code>z = r - x * x</code>, and set t to be the largest power of 2 dividing z with a bit trick. This allows me to skip t values that wouldn't have affected the value of r anyway. The precomputed start value in my case picks out the ""smallest positive"" square root modulo 8192. Even if this code doesn't work faster for you, I hope you enjoy some of the ideas it contains. Complete, tested code follows, including the precomputed tables. BIGBLOCK","The solution is a three-step approach to determine if an integer's square root is an integer.

75191,442647,What is an unsigned char?,"Because i feel it's really called for, i just want to state some rules of C and C++ (they are the same in this regard). First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object. Second, <code>unsigned char</code> is explicitly stated unsigned. Now, i had a discussion with someone about what happens when you convert the value <code>-1</code> of type int to <code>unsigned char</code>. He refused the idea that the resulting <code>unsigned char</code> has all its bits set to 1, because he was worried about sign representation. But he don't have to. It's immediately following out of this rule that the conversion does what is intended: If the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or   subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type   until the value is in the range of the new type. (<code>6.3.1.3p2</code> in a C99 draft) That's a mathematical description. C++ describes it in terms of modulo calculus, which yields to the same rule. Anyway, what is not guaranteed is that all bits in the integer <code>-1</code> are one before the conversion. So, what do we have so we can claim that the resulting <code>unsigned char</code> has all its <code>CHAR_BIT</code> bits turned to 1? All bits participate in determining its value - that is, no padding bits occur in the object. Adding only one time <code>UCHAR_MAX+1</code> to <code>-1</code> will yield a value in range, namely <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> That's enough, actually! So whenever you want to have an <code>unsigned char</code> having all its bits one, you do It also follows that a conversion is not just truncating higher order bits. The fortunate event for two's complement is that it is just a truncation there, but the same isn't necessarily true for other sign representations.","Unsigned char is a data type in C and C++ where all its bits participate in determining the value. When converting an int to unsigned char, the value is adjusted to fit within the new type's range by repeatedly adding or subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented. This ensures all bits are set to 1 in the resulting unsigned char, as demonstrated by adding UCHAR_MAX+1 to -1, which yields UCHAR_MAX.","First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object.

You will need to verify with your particular DBMS help documentation for specifics. As I am most familiar with SQL Server I will use that as my samples. To create a stored procedure the syntax is fairly simple: So for example: A benefit of stored procedures is that you can centralize data access logic into a single place that is then easy for DBA's to optimize. Stored procedures also have a security benefit in that you can grant execute rights to a stored procedure but the user will not need to have read/write permissions on the underlying tables. This is a good first step against SQL injection. Stored procedures do come with downsides, basically the maintenance associated with your basic CRUD operation. Let's say for each table you have an Insert, Update, Delete and at least one select based on the primary key, that means each table will have 4 procedures. Now take a decent size database of 400 tables, and you have 1600 procedures! And that's assuming you don't have duplicates which you probably will. This is where using an ORM or some other method to auto generate your basic CRUD operations has a ton of merit.","Stored procedures are a batch of SQL statements that can be executed in a couple of ways, supported by most DBMS systems. The syntax to create a stored procedure is simple: `CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name AS BEGIN SQL statements END`.

Now, let's have a look at the following snippet: Since Base's destructor is not <code>virtual</code> and <code>b</code> is a <code>Base*</code> pointing to a <code>Derived</code> object, <code>delete b</code> has undefined behaviour: [In <code>delete b</code>], if the static type of the  object to be deleted is different from its dynamic type, the static  type shall be a base class of the dynamic type of the object to be  deleted and <strong>the static type shall have a virtual destructor or the  behavior is undefined</strong>. In most implementations, the call to the destructor will be resolved like any non-virtual code, meaning that the destructor of the base class will be called but not the one of the derived class, resulting in a resources leak. To sum up, always make base classes' destructors <code>virtual</code> when they're meant to be manipulated polymorphically. If you want to prevent the deletion of an instance through a base class pointer, you can make the base class destructor protected and nonvirtual; by doing so, the compiler won't let you call <code>delete</code> on a base class pointer.

In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. In one sentence: As the size of your job goes up, how much longer does it take to complete it? Obviously that's only using ""size"" as the input and ""time taken"" as the output &mdash; the same idea applies if you want to talk about memory usage etc. Here's an example where we have N T-shirts which we want to dry. We'll <em>assume</em> it's incredibly quick to get them in the drying position (i.e. the human interaction is negligible). That's not the case in real life, of course... <li>Using a washing line outside: assuming you have an infinitely large back yard, washing dries in O(1) time. However much you have of it, it'll get the same sun and fresh air, so the size doesn't affect the drying time. <li>Using a tumble dryer: you put 10 shirts in each load, and then they're done an hour later. (Ignore the actual numbers here &mdash; they're irrelevant.) So drying 50 shirts takes <em>about</em> 5 times as long as drying 10 shirts. <li>Putting everything in an airing cupboard: If we put everything in one big pile and just let general warmth do it, it will take a long time for the middle shirts to get dry. I wouldn't like to guess at the detail, but I suspect this is at least O(N^2) &mdash; as you increase the wash load, the drying time increases faster. One important aspect of ""big O"" notation is that it <em>doesn't</em> say which algorithm will be faster for a given size. Take a hashtable (string key, integer value)  vs an array of pairs (string, integer). Is it faster to find a key in the hashtable or an element in the array, based on a string? (i.e. for the array, ""find the first element where the string part matches the given key."") Hashtables are generally amortised (~= ""on average"") O(1) &mdash; once they're set up, it should take about the same time to find an entry in a 100 entry table as in a 1,000,000 entry table. Finding an element in an array (based on content rather than index) is linear, i.e. O(N) &mdash; on average, you're going to have to look at half the entries. Does this make a hashtable faster than an array for lookups? Not necessarily. If you've got a very small collection of entries, an array may well be faster &mdash; you may be able to check all the strings in the time that it takes to just calculate the hashcode of the one you're looking at. As the data set grows larger, however, the hashtable will eventually beat the array.","Big O notation measures the time or space complexity of an algorithm, indicating how its performance scales with input size.

487258,487278,"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?","Quick note, this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation (which is a two-side bound). In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: The simplest definition I can give for Big-O notation is this: <strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> There are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence: <li><strong>relative:</strong> you can only compare apples to apples. You can't compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers. But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful; <li><strong>representation:</strong> Big-O (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable. That variable is chosen based on observations or assumptions. For example, sorting algorithms are typically compared based on comparison operations (comparing two nodes to determine their relative ordering). This assumes that comparison is expensive. But what if comparison is cheap but swapping is expensive? It changes the comparison; and <li><strong>complexity:</strong> if it takes me one second to sort 10,000 elements how long will it take me to sort one million? Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else. Come back and reread the above when you've read the rest. The best example of Big-O I can think of is doing arithmetic. Take two numbers (123456 and 789012). The basic arithmetic operations we learnt in school were: <li>addition; <li>subtraction; <li>multiplication; and <li>division. Each of these is an operation or a problem. A method of solving these is called an <strong>algorithm</strong>. Addition is the simplest. You line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition in the result. The 'tens' part of that number is carried over to the next column. Let's assume that the addition of these numbers is the most expensive operation in this algorithm. It stands to reason that to add these two numbers together we have to add together 6 digits (and possibly carry a 7th). If we add two 100 digit numbers together we have to do 100 additions. If we add <strong>two</strong> 10,000 digit numbers we have to do 10,000 additions. See the pattern? The <strong>complexity</strong> (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits <em>n</em> in the larger number. We call this <strong>O(n)</strong> or <strong>linear complexity</strong>. Subtraction is similar (except you may need to borrow instead of carry). Multiplication is different. You line the numbers up, take the first digit in the bottom number and multiply it in turn against each digit in the top number and so on through each digit. So to multiply our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplications. We may need to do as many as 10 or 11 column adds to get the end result too. If we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10,000 multiplications and 200 adds. For two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (1012) multiplications and two million adds. As the algorithm scales with n-<em>squared</em>, this is <strong>O(n2)</strong> or <strong>quadratic complexity</strong>. This is a good time to introduce another important concept: <strong>We only care about the most significant portion of complexity.</strong> The astute may have realized that we could express the number of operations as: n2 + 2n. But as you saw from our example with two numbers of a million digits apiece, the second term (2n) becomes insignificant (accounting for 0.0002% of the total operations by that stage). One can notice that we've assumed the worst case scenario here. While multiplying 6 digit numbers if one of them is 4 digit and the other one is 6 digit, then we only have 24 multiplications. Still we calculate the worst case scenario for that 'n', i.e when both are 6 digit numbers. Hence Big-O notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm The Telephone Book The next best example I can think of is the telephone book, normally called the White Pages or similar but it'll vary from country to country. But I'm talking about the one that lists people by surname and then initials or first name, possibly address and then telephone numbers. Now if you were instructing a computer to look up the phone number for ""John Smith"" in a telephone book that contains 1,000,000 names, what would you do? Ignoring the fact that you could guess how far in the S's started (let's assume you can't), what would you do? A typical implementation might be to open up to the middle, take the 500,000th and compare it to ""Smith"". If it happens to be ""Smith, John"", we just got real lucky. Far more likely is that ""John Smith"" will be before or after that name. If it's after we then divide the last half of the phone book in half and repeat. If it's before then we divide the first half of the phone book in half and repeat. And so on. This is called a <strong>binary search</strong> and is used every day in programming whether you realize it or not. So if you want to find a name in a phone book of a million names you can actually find any name by doing this at most 20 times. In comparing search algorithms we decide that this comparison is our 'n'. <li>For a phone book of 3 names it takes 2 comparisons (at most). <li>For 7 it takes at most 3. <li>For 15 it takes 4. <li>For 1,000,000 it takes 20. That is staggeringly good isn't it? In Big-O terms this is <strong>O(log n)</strong> or <strong>logarithmic complexity</strong>. Now the logarithm in question could be ln (base e), log10, log2 or some other base. It doesn't matter it's still O(log n) just like O(2n2) and O(100n2) are still both O(n2). It's worthwhile at this point to explain that Big O can be used to determine three cases with an algorithm: <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> In the telephone book search, the best case is that we find the name in one comparison. This is <strong>O(1)</strong> or <strong>constant complexity</strong>; <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> As discussed above this is O(log n); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> This is also O(log n). Normally we don't care about the best case. We're interested in the expected and worst case. Sometimes one or the other of these will be more important. Back to the telephone book. What if you have a phone number and want to find a name? The police have a reverse phone book but such look-ups are denied to the general public. Or are they? Technically you can reverse look-up a number in an ordinary phone book. How? You start at the first name and compare the number. If it's a match, great, if not, you move on to the next. You have to do it this way because the phone book is <strong>unordered</strong> (by phone number anyway). So to find a name given the phone number (reverse lookup): <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> O(1); <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> O(n) (for 500,000); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> O(n) (for 1,000,000). The Travelling Salesman This is quite a famous problem in computer science and deserves a mention. In this problem you have N towns. Each of those towns is linked to 1 or more other towns by a road of a certain distance. The Travelling Salesman problem is to find the shortest tour that visits every town. Sounds simple? Think again. If you have 3 towns A, B and C with roads between all pairs then you could go: So the Big-O of the Travelling Salesman problem is <strong>O(n! )</strong> or <strong>factorial or combinatorial complexity</strong>. <strong>By the time you get to 200 towns there isn't enough time left in the universe to solve the problem with traditional computers.</strong> Something to think about. Polynomial Time Another point I wanted to make quick mention of is that any algorithm that has a complexity of <strong>O(na)</strong> is said to have <strong>polynomial complexity</strong> or is solvable in <strong>polynomial time</strong>. O(n), O(n2) etc are all polynomial time. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time. Certain things are used in the world because of this. Public Key Cryptography is a prime example. It is computationally hard to find two prime factors of a very large number. If it wasn't, we couldn't use the public key systems we use. Anyway, that's it for my (hopefully plain English) explanation of Big O (revised).",ERROR: Prompt length of 2373 is longer than the maximum model length of 2048.,"If we add <strong>two</strong> 10,000 digit numbers we have to do 10,000 additions.

It cuts to the bone and gives only information about the scaling nature of an algorithm, specifically how the resource use (think time or memory) of an algorithm scales in response to the ""input size"". Consider the difference between a steam engine and a rocket. They are not merely different varieties of the same thing (as, say, a Prius engine vs. a Lamborghini engine) but they are dramatically different kinds of propulsion systems, at their core. A steam engine may be faster than a toy rocket, but no steam piston engine will be able to achieve the speeds of an orbital launch vehicle. This is because these systems have different scaling characteristics with regards to the relation of fuel required (""resource usage"") to reach a given speed (""input size""). Why is this so important? Because software deals with problems that may differ in size by factors up to a trillion. Consider that for a moment. The ratio between the speed necessary to travel to the Moon and human walking speed is less than 10,000:1, and that is absolutely tiny compared to the range in input sizes software may face. And because software may face an astronomical range in input sizes there is the potential for the Big O complexity of an algorithm, it's fundamental scaling nature, to trump any implementation details. Consider the canonical sorting example. Bubble-sort is O(n2) while merge-sort is O(n log n). Let's say you have two sorting applications, application A which uses bubble-sort and application B which uses merge-sort, and let's say that for input sizes of around 30 elements application A is 1,000x faster than application B at sorting. If you never have to sort much more than 30 elements then it's obvious that you should prefer application A, as it is much faster at these input sizes. However, if you find that you may have to sort ten million items then what you'd expect is that application B actually ends up being thousands of times faster than application A in this case, entirely due to the way each algorithm scales.","Big O notation describes the fundamental scaling nature of an algorithm, specifically how resource usage (time or memory) scales with input size.

500431,500438,What is the scope of variables in JavaScript?,"Javascript uses scope chains to establish the scope for a given function. There is typically one global scope, and each function defined has its own nested scope. Any function defined within another function has a local scope which is linked to the outer function. It's always the position in the source that defines the scope. An element in the scope chain is basically a Map with a pointer to its parent scope. When resolving a variable, javascript starts at the innermost scope and searches outwards.","Javascript uses scope chains to establish scope, consisting of a global scope and nested function scopes. Each function has its own scope, with inner functions inheriting from their outer functions.

500431,500459,What is the scope of variables in JavaScript?,"I think about the best I can do is give you a bunch of examples to study. Javascript programmers are practically ranked by how well they understand scope. It can at times be quite counter-intuitive.

Intermediate: Object properties Advanced: Closure Advanced: Prototype-based scope resolution Global+Local: An extra complex Case This will print out <code>undefined</code> and <code>10</code> rather than <code>5</code> and <code>10</code> since JavaScript always moves variable declarations (not initializations) to the top of the scope, making the code equivalent to: Catch clause-scoped variable This will print out <code>5</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>5</code>. Inside the catch clause <code>e</code> shadows global and local variables. But this special scope is only for the caught variable. If you write <code>var f;</code> inside the catch clause, then it's exactly the same as if you had defined it before or after the try-catch block.","JavaScript scope variables are classified into several types: global, local, block (introduced in ES6 with `let`), object properties, closure, prototype-based, and global+local. 

Key characteristics of each scope include:

- Global scope: variables are accessible throughout the script
- Local scope: variables are only accessible within the function or block they are defined in
- Block scope (ES6): introduced with `let`, variables are only accessible within the block they are defined in
- Object properties: variables are properties of an object
- Closure: variables are accessible within a nested function
- Prototype-based scope resolution: variables are resolved based on the prototype chain

544010,544111,Difference between div id and div class,"Classes are like categories. Many HTML elements can belong to a class, and an HTML element can have more than one class. Classes are used to apply general styles or styles that can be applied across multiple HTML elements. IDs are identifiers. They're unique; no one else is allowed to have that same ID. IDs are used to apply unique styles to an HTML element. I use IDs and classes in this fashion: In this example, the header and content sections can be styled via #header and #content. Each section of the content can be applied a common style through #content .section. Just for kicks, I added a ""special"" class for the middle section. Suppose you wanted a particular section to have a special styling. This can be achieved with the .special class, yet the section still inherits the common styles from #content .section. When I do JavaScript or CSS development, I typically use IDs to access/manipulate a very specific HTML element, and I use classes to access/apply styles to a broad range of elements.","HTML elements can have either an ID or a class, but not both.

572897,572996,How does JavaScript .prototype work?,"Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]]. If you look up a property via <code>obj.propName</code> or <code>obj['propName']</code> and the object does not have such a property - which can be checked via <code>obj.hasOwnProperty('propName')</code> - the runtime looks up the property in the object referenced by [[Prototype]] instead. If the prototype-object also doesn't have such a property, its prototype is checked in turn, thus walking the original object's prototype-chain until a match is found or its end is reached. Some JavaScript implementations allow direct access to the [[Prototype]] property, eg via a non-standard property named <code>__proto__</code>. In general, it's only possible to set an object's prototype during object creation: If you create a new object via <code>new Func()</code>, the object's [[Prototype]] property will be set to the object referenced by <code>Func.prototype</code>. This allows to simulate classes in JavaScript, although JavaScript's inheritance system is - as we have seen - prototypical, and not class-based: Just think of constructor functions as classes and the properties of the prototype (ie of the object referenced by the constructor function's <code>prototype</code> property) as shared members, ie members which are the same for each instance.

597588,597726,How do you clone an Array of Objects in Javascript?,"The issue with your shallow copy is that all the objects aren't cloned. While the references to each object are unique in each array, once you ultimately grab onto it you're dealing with the same object as before. There is nothing wrong with the way you cloned it...  the same result would occur using Array.slice(). The reason your deep copy is having problems is because you're ending up with circular object references. Deep will go as deep as it can go, and if you've got a circle, it'll keep going infinitely until the browser faints. If the data structure cannot be represented as a directed acyclic graph, then I'm not sure you're going to be able to find an all-purpose method for deep cloning. Cyclic graphs provide many tricky corner cases, and since it's not a common operation I doubt anyone has written a full solution (if it's even possible - it might not be! But I have no time to try to write a rigorous proof now.). I found some good comments on the issue on this page. If you need a deep copy of an Array of Objects with circular references I believe you're going to have to code your own method to handle your specialized data structure, such that it is a multi-pass clone: <li>On round one, make a clone of all objects that don't reference other objects in the array. Keep a track of each object's origins. <li>On round two, link the objects together.","Arrays of objects in JavaScript cannot be cloned using a single method due to potential circular references. A custom multi-pass cloning approach is required for complex data structures. 

1. Create a clone of objects without references to other objects in the array.
2. Track each object's origin.
3. In a second pass, link the objects together.


```javascript
function deepClone(arr) {

If I had this problem I'd either add special <code>clone()</code> methods to the problematic objects or remember which objects I've already copied. I'd do it with a variable <code>copyCount</code> which increases by 1 every time you copy in your code. An object that has a lower <code>copyCount</code> than the current copy-process is copied. If not, the copy, that exists already, should be referenced. This makes it necessary to link from the original to its copy. There is still one problem: Memory. If you have this reference from one object to the other, it's likely that the browser can't free those objects, as they are always referenced from somewhere. You'd have to make a second pass where you set all copy-references to Null. (If you do this, you'd not have to have a <code>copyCount</code> but a boolean <code>isCopied</code> would be enough, as you can reset the value in the second pass.)","To clone an array of objects in JavaScript, you can implement a recursive function that keeps track of copied objects using a `copyCount` variable.

After all, the sequence of assembly language instructions for a sqrt is tiny. Intel has a hardware instruction, which isn't used by Java I believe because it doesn't conform to IEEE. So why is it slow? Because Java is actually calling a C routine through JNI, and it's actually slower to do so than to call a Java subroutine, which itself is slower than doing it inline. This is very annoying, and Java should have come up with a better solution, ie building in floating point library calls if necessary. Oh well. In C++, I suspect all the complex alternatives would lose on speed, but I haven't checked them all.What I did, and what Java people will find usefull, is a simple hack, an extension of the special case testing suggested by A. Rex. Use a single long value as a bit array, which isn't bounds checked. That way, you have 64 bit boolean lookup. BIGBLOCK The routine isPerfectSquare5 runs in about 1/3 the time on my core2 duo machine. I suspect that further tweaks along the same lines could reduce the time further on average, but every time you check, you are trading off more testing for more eliminating, so you can't go too much farther on that road. Certainly, rather than having a separate test for negative, you could check the high 6 bits the same way. Note that all I'm doing is eliminating possible squares, but when I have a potential case I have to call the original, inlined isPerfectSquare. The init2 routine is called once to initialize the static values of pp1 and pp2.Note that in my implementation in C++, I'm using unsigned long long, so since you're signed, you'd have to use the >>> operator. There is no intrinsic need to bounds check the array, but Java's optimizer has to figure this stuff out pretty quickly, so I don't blame them for that.","A simple hack to determine if an integer's square root is an integer uses a single long value as a bit array to perform a 64-bit boolean lookup, eliminating possible squares.

long pp2 = (1L << 16) + 1L;
// initialize static values
// then, for a given number n:

592620,677212,How to check if a program exists from a Bash script?,"Answer POSIX compatible: For <code>bash</code> specific environments: Explanation Avoid <code>which</code>. Not only is it an external process you're launching for doing very little (meaning builtins like <code>hash</code>, <code>type</code> or <code>command</code> are way cheaper), you can also rely on the builtins to actually do what you want, while the effects of external commands can easily vary from system to system. Why care? Many operating systems have a <code>which</code> that doesn't even set an exit status, meaning the <code>if which foo</code> won't even work there and will always report that <code>foo</code> exists, even if it doesn't (note that some POSIX shells appear to do this for <code>hash</code> too). Many operating systems make <code>which</code> do custom and evil stuff like change the output or even hook into the package manager. So, don't use <code>which</code>. Instead use one of these: (Minor side-note: some will suggest <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> is the same <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code> but shorter Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?this is untrue. <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> closes FD 2 which causes an error in the program when it tries to write to stderr, which is very different from successfully writing to it and discarding the output (and dangerous!)) If your hash bang is <code>/bin/sh</code> then you should care about what POSIX says. <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code>'s exit codes aren't terribly well defined by POSIX, and <code>hash</code> is seen to exit successfully when the command doesn't exist (haven't seen this with <code>type</code> yet). <code>command</code>'s exit status is well defined by POSIX, so that one is probably the safest to use. If your script uses <code>bash</code> though, POSIX rules don't really matter anymore and both <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code> become perfectly safe to use. <code>type</code> now has a <code>-P</code> to search just the <code>PATH</code> and <code>hash</code> has the side-effect that the command's location will be hashed (for faster lookup next time you use it), which is usually a good thing since you probably check for its existence in order to actually use it. As a simple example, here's a function that runs <code>gdate</code> if it exists, otherwise <code>date</code>:","Use `command` for POSIX compatibility:

295579,682088,Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer,"Project Euler is mentioned in the tags and many of the problems in it require checking numbers >> 2^64. Most of the optimizations mentioned above don't work easily when you are working with an 80 byte buffer. I used java BigInteger and a slightly modified version of Newton's method, one that works better with integers. The problem was that exact squares n^2 converged to (n-1) instead of n because n^2-1 = (n-1)(n+1) and the final error was just one step below the final divisor and the algorithm terminated. It was easy to fix by adding one to the original argument before computing the error. (Add two for cube roots, etc.) One nice attribute of this algorithm is that you can immediately tell if the number is a perfect square - the final error (not correction) in Newton's method will be zero. A simple modification also lets you quickly calculate floor(sqrt(x)) instead of the closest integer. This is handy with several Euler problems.",A modified Newton's method using Java BigInteger is used to determine if an integer's square root is an integer.

310634,691798,"What is the ""right"" way to iterate through an array in Ruby?","I'm not saying that <code>Array</code> -> <code>|value,index|</code> and <code>Hash</code> -> <code>|key,value|</code> is not insane (see Horace Loeb's comment), but I am saying that there is a sane way to expect this arrangement. When I am dealing with arrays, I am focused on the elements in the array (not the index because the index is transitory). The method is each with index, i.e. each+index, or |each,index|, or <code>|value,index|</code>. This is also consistent with the index being viewed as an optional argument, e.g. |value| is equivalent to |value,index=nil| which is consistent with |value,index|. When I am dealing with hashes, I am often more focused on the keys than the values, and I am usually dealing with keys and values in that order, either <code>key =&gt; value</code> or <code>hash[key] = value</code>. If you want duck-typing, then either explicitly use a defined method as Brent Longborough showed, or an implicit method as maxhawkins showed. Ruby is all about accommodating the language to suit the programmer, not about the programmer accommodating to suit the language. This is why there are so many ways. There are so many ways to think about something. In Ruby, you choose the closest and the rest of the code usually falls out extremely neatly and concisely. As for the original question, ""What is the __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through an array in Ruby? "", well, I think the core way (i.e. without powerful syntactic sugar or object oriented power) is to do: But Ruby is all about powerful syntactic sugar and object oriented power, but anyway here is the equivalent for hashes, and the keys can be ordered or not: So, my answer is, ""The __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through an array in Ruby depends on you (i.e. the programmer or the programming team) and the project."". The better Ruby programmer makes the better choice (of which syntactic power and/or which object oriented approach). The better Ruby programmer continues to look for more ways. Now, I want to ask another question, ""What is the __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through a Range in Ruby backwards?""! (This question is how I came to this page.) It is nice to do (for the forwards): but I don't like to do (for the backwards): Well, I don't actually mind doing that too much, but when I am teaching going backwards, I want to show my students a nice symmetry (i.e. with minimal difference, e.g. only adding a reverse, or a step -1, but without modifying anything else). You can do (for symmetry): and which I don't like much, but you can't do You could ultimately do but I want to teach pure Ruby rather than object oriented approaches (just yet). I would like to iterate backwards: without creating an array (consider 0..1000000000) working for any Range (e.g. Strings, not just Integers) without using any extra object oriented power (i.e. no class modification) I believe this is impossible without defining a <code>pred</code> method, which means modifying the Range class to use it. If you can do this please let me know, otherwise confirmation of impossibility would be appreciated though it would be disappointing. Perhaps Ruby 1.9 addresses this. (Thanks for your time in reading this.)","The ""right"" way to iterate through an array in Ruby is to use the `each` method with index, i.e. `each+index` or `|value,index|`, which is consistent with treating the index as an optional argument.

For example: In order to avoid having to use the <code>enum</code> keyword everywhere, a typedef can be created: This can be simplified into one line: And finally, if we don't need to be able to use <code>enum tagname</code> with the <code>enum</code> keyword, we can make the <code>enum</code> anonymous and only declare it with the typedef name: Now, in this case, we're declaring <code>ShapeType</code> to be a typedef'ed name of an anonymous enumeration. <code>ShapeType</code> is really just an integral type, and should only be used to declare variables which hold one of the values listed in the declaration (that is, one of <code>kCircle</code>, <code>kRectangle</code>, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code>).

544010,719613,Difference between div id and div class,"Where to use an ID versus a class The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. Therefore, it is appropriate to use an ID on the div element that is marking up the main content on the page, as there will only be one main content section. In contrast, you must use a class to set up alternating row colors on a table, as they are by definition going to be used more than once. IDs are an incredibly powerful tool. An element with an ID can be the target of a piece of JavaScript that manipulates the element or its contents in some way. The ID attribute can be used as the target of an internal link, replacing anchor tags with name attributes. Finally, if you make your IDs clear and logical, they can serve as a sort of Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦Â¸Âelf documentationÃ©Â?within the document.

722651,722744,How do I pass multiple parameters in Objective-C?,"Yes; the Objective-C method syntax is like this for a couple of reasons; one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying are. For example, if you are adding an object to an <code>NSMutableArray</code> at a certain index, you would do it using the method: BIGBLOCK This method is called <code>insertObject:atIndex:</code> and it is clear that an object is being inserted at a specified index. In practice, adding a string ""Hello, World!"" at index 5 of an <code>NSMutableArray</code> called <code>array</code> would be called as follows: BIGBLOCK This also reduces ambiguity between the order of the method parameters, ensuring that you pass the object parameter first, <em>then</em> the index parameter. This becomes more useful when using functions that take a large number of arguments, and reduces error in passing the arguments. Furthermore, the method naming convention is such because Objective-C doesn't support overloading; however, if you want to write a method that does the same job, but takes different data-types, this can be accomplished; take, for instance, the <code>NSNumber</code> class; this has several object creation methods, including: <li><code>+ (id)numberWithBool:(BOOL)value;</code> <li><code>+ (id)numberWithFloat:(float)value;</code> <li><code>+ (id)numberWithDouble:(double)value;</code> In a language such as C++, you would simply overload the number method to allow different data types to be passed as the argument; however, in Objective-C, this syntax allows several different variants of the same function to be implemented, by changing the name of the method for each variant of the function.",,,"Yes; the Objective-C method syntax is like this for a couple of reasons; one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying are.

748062,748093,How can I return multiple values from a function in C#?,"Previous poster is right. You cannot return multiple values from a C# method. However, you do have a couple of options: Return a structure that contains multiple members Return an instance of a class Use output parameters (using the out or ref keywords) Use a dictionary or key-value pair as output The pros and cons here are often hard to figure out. If you return a structure, make sure it's small because structs are value type and passed on the stack. If you return an instance of a class, there are some design patterns here that you might want to use to avoid causing problems - members of classes can be modified because C# passes objects by reference (you don't have ByVal like you did in VB). Finally you can use output parameters but I would limit the use of this to scenarios when you only have a couple (like 3 or less) of parameters - otherwise things get ugly and hard to maintain. Also, the use of output parameters can be an inhibitor to agility because your method signature will have to change every time you need to add something to the return value whereas returning a struct or class instance you can add members without modifying the method signature. From an architectural standpoint I would recommend against using key-value pairs or dictionaries. I find this style of coding requires ""secret knowledge"" in code that consumes the method. It must know ahead of time what the keys are going to be and what the values mean and if the developer working on the internal implementation changes the way the dictionary or KVP is created, it could easily create a failure cascade throughout the entire application.","In C#, you can return multiple values from a function using:

When you inherit from this pure abstract class you are defining a hierarchy -> inheritance, if you implement the interface you are not, and you can implement as many interfaces as you want, but you can only inherit from one class. 2) You can define a property in an interface, so the class that implements that interface must have that property. For example: The class that implements that interface must have a property like that.","Interfaces and abstract classes share similarities, but have key differences. An interface is a pure abstract class, but implementing an interface does not imply inheritance, whereas inheriting from an abstract class does.

There is no denying that there are some of situations where you do need access to a single instance, and it can be accomplished other ways.

This gives you the benefit of the classes that depend on the instance to be unaware of the fact that there is a single instance. The lifetime of the singleton can be changed in the future.

Lifecycle management (when instances are creared snd when they go out of scope) should not be part of the cladses responsibility. The accepted best practice for this is to craft or configure a new component to manage dependencies using dependency injection. Often software gets more complicated it makes sense to have multiple independent instances of the ""singleton"" class with different state. Committing code to simply grab the singleton is wrong in such cases. Using Singleton.getInstance() might be ok for small simple systems but it doesn't work / scale when one might need a different instance of the same class. No class should be thought of as a singleton but rather that should be an aplication of it's usage or how it is used to configure dependents. For a quick and nasty this does not matter- just luke hardcoding say file paths does not matter but for bigger applications such dependencies need to be factored out and managed in more appropriate way using DI.

They both work with the same abstractions: a series of snapshots (changesets) which make up the history. Each changeset knows where it came from (the parent changeset) and can have many child changesets. The recent hg-git extension provides a two-way bridge between Mercurial and Git and sort of shows this point. Git has a strong focus on mutating this history graph (with all the consequences that entails) whereas Mercurial does not encourage history rewriting, but it's easy to do anyway and the consequences of doing so are exactly what you should expect them to be (that is, if I modify a changeset you already have, your client will see it as new if you pull from me). So Mercurial has a <em>bias</em> towards non-destructive commands. As for light-weight branches, then Mercurial has supported repositories with <em>multiple branches</em> since..., always I think. Git repositories with multiple branches are exactly that: multiple diverged strands of development in a single repository. Git then adds names to these strands and allow you to query these names remotely. The Bookmarks extension for Mercurial adds local names, and with Mercurial 1.6, you can move these bookmarks around when you push/pull.. I use Linux, but apparently TortoiseHg is faster and better than the Git equivalent on Windows (due to better usage of the poor Windows filesystem). Both http://github.com and http://bitbucket.org provide online hosting, the service at Bitbucket is great and responsive (I haven't tried github).

Try taking a peek at the <code>git-instaweb.sh</code> file if you want to know what I mean: it is a <strong>shell</strong> script which generates a <strong>Ruby</strong> script, which I think runs a webserver. The shell script generates another shell script to launch the first Ruby script. There is also a bit of <strong>Perl</strong>, for good measure. I like the blog post that compares Mercurial and Git with James Bond and MacGyver -- Mercurial is somehow more low-key than Git. It seems to me, that people using Mercurial are not so easily impressed. This is reflected in how each system do what Linus described as ""the coolest merge EVER!"". In Git you can merge with an unrelated repository by doing: Those commands look quite arcane to my eye. In Mercurial we do: Notice how the Mercurial commands are plain and not special at all -- the only unusual thing is the <code>--force</code> flag to <code>hg pull</code>, which is needed since Mercurial will abort otherwise when you pull from an unrelated repository.

894490,894659,SQL left join vs multiple tables on FROM line?,"The old syntax, with just listing the tables, and using the <code>WHERE</code> clause to specify the join criteria, is being deprecated in most modern databases. It's not just for show, the old syntax has the possibility of being ambiguous when you use both INNER and OUTER joins in the same query. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose you have 3 tables in your system: BIGBLOCK Each table contain numerous rows, linked together. You got multiple companies, and each company can have multiple departments, and each department can have multiple employees. Ok, so now you want to do the following: List all the companies, and include all their departments, and all their employees. Note that some companies don't have any departments yet, but make sure you include them as well. Make sure you only retrieve departments that have employees, but always list all companies. So you do this: BIGBLOCK Note that the last one there is an inner join, in order to fulfill the criteria that you only want departments with people. Ok, so what happens now. Well, the problem is, it depends on the database engine, the query optimizer, indexes, and table statistics. Let me explain. If the query optimizer determines that the way to do this is to first take a company, then find the departments, and then do an inner join with employees, you're not going to get any companies that don't have departments. The reason for this is that the <code>WHERE</code> clause determines which <em>rows</em> end up in the final result, not individual parts of the rows. And in this case, due to the left join, the Department.ID column will be NULL, and thus when it comes to the INNER JOIN to Employee, there's no way to fulfill that constraint for the Employee row, and so it won't appear. On the other hand, if the query optimizer decides to tackle the department-employee join first, and then do a left join with the companies, you will see them. So the old syntax is ambiguous. There's no way to specify what you want, without dealing with query hints, and some databases have no way at all. Enter the new syntax, with this you can choose. For instance, if you want all companies, as the problem description stated, this is what you would write: BIGBLOCK Here you specify that you want the department-employee join to be done as one join, and then left join the results of that with the companies. Additionally, let's say you only want departments that contains the letter X in their name. Again, with old style joins, you risk losing the company as well, if it doesn't have any departments with an X in its name, but with the new syntax, you can do this: BIGBLOCK This extra clause is used for the joining, but is not a filter for the entire row.

For example, you may have fields that are derived from other fields, and should only be done so programmatically, rather than having the state be persisted via serialization. Here's a <code>GalleryImage</code> class which contains an image and a thumbnail derived from the image: In this example, the <code>thumbnailImage</code> is a thumbnail image that is generated by invoking the <code>generateThumbnail</code> method. The <code>thumbnailImage</code> field is marked as <code>transient</code>, so only the original <code>image</code> is serialized rather than persisting both the original image and the thumbnail image. This means that less storage would be needed to save the serialized object. (Of course, this may or may not be desirable depending on the requirements of the system -- this is just an example.) At the time of deserialization, the <code>readObject</code> method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object back to the state at which the serialization occurred. Here, the thumbnail needs to be generated, so the <code>readObject</code> method is overridden so that the thumbnail will be generated by calling the <code>generateThumbnail</code> method.

936197,936455,What is the difference between application server and web server?,"As Rutesh and jmservera pointed out, the distinction is a fuzzy one. Historically, they were different, but through the 90's these two previously distinct categories blended features and effectively merged. At this point is is probably best to imagine that the ""App Server"" product category is a strict superset of the ""web server"" category. Some history. In early days of the Mosaic browser and hyperlinked content, there evolved this thing called a ""web server"" that served web page content and images over HTTP. Most of the content was static, and the HTTP 1.0 protocol was just a way to ship files around. Quickly the ""web server"" category evolved to include CGI capability - effectively launching a process on each web request to generate dynamic content. HTTP also matured and the products became more sophisticated, with caching, security, and management features. As the technology matured, we got company-specific Java-based server-side technology from Kiva and NetDynamics, which eventually all merged into JSP. Microsoft added ASP, I think in 1996, to Windows NT 4.0. The static web server had learned some new tricks, so that it was an effective ""app server"" for many scenarios. In a parallel category, the app server had evolved and existed for a long time. companies delivered products for Unix like Tuxedo, TopEnd, Encina that were philosophically derived from Mainframe application management and monitoring environments like IMS and CICS. Microsoft's offering was Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), which later evolved into COM+. Most of these products specified ""closed"" product-specific communications protocols to interconnect ""fat"" clients to servers. (For Encina, the comms protocol was DCE RPC; for MTS it was DCOM; etc.) In 1995/96, these traditional app server products began to embed basic HTTP communication capability, at first via gateways. And the lines began to blur. Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads, more concurrency, and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability. At this point the line between ""app server"" and ""web server"" is a fuzzy one. But people continue to use the terms differently, as a matter of emphasis. When someone says ""web server"" you often think HTTP-centric, web UI, oriented apps. When someone says ""App server"" you may think ""heavier loads, enterprise features, transactions and queuing, multi-channel communication (HTTP + more). But often it is the same product that serves both sets of workload requirements. <li>WebSphere, IBM's ""app server"" has its own bundled web server. <li>WebLogic, another traditional app server, likewise. <li>Windows, which is Microsoft's App Server (in addition to being its File&amp;Print Server, Media Server, etc. ), bundles IIS.","The distinction between application server and web server is a fuzzy one, as they have evolved from distinct categories to a superset relationship.

Then to derive a good key from this information: The magic numbers (which could be defined as constants somewhere) 65536 and 256 are the key derivation iteration count and the key size, respectively. The key derivation function is iterated to require significant computational effort, and that prevents attackers from quickly trying many different passwords. The iteration count can be changed depending on the computing resources available. The key size can be reduced to 128 bits, which is still considered ""strong"" encryption, but it doesn't give much of a safety margin if attacks are discovered that weaken AES. Used with a proper block-chaining mode, the same derived key can be used to encrypt many messages. In CBC, a random initialization vector (IV) is generated for each message, yielding different cipher text even if the plain text is identical. CBC may not be the most secure mode available to you (see AEAD below); there are many other modes with different security properties, but they all use a similar random input. In any case, the outputs of each encryption operation are the cipher text and the initialization vector: Store the <code>ciphertext</code> and the <code>iv</code>. On decryption, the <code>SecretKey</code> is regenerated in exactly the same way, using using the password with the same salt and iteration parameters.

One of these modes is strongly recommended in place of CBC; it will protect the integrity of the data as well as their privacy. A <code>java.security.InvalidKeyException</code> with the message ""Illegal key size or default parameters"" means that the cryptography strength is limited; the unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files are not in the correct location.

1028250,1028551,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external ""stimuli"" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations. This is pretty well suited to UI design, for example, in which touching a user interface control (say, the volume control on a music playing application) might need to update various display items and the actual volume of audio output. When you modify the volume (a slider, let's say) that would correspond to modifying the value associated with a node in a directed graph. Various nodes having edges from that ""volume value"" node would automatically be triggered and any necessary computations and updates would naturally ripple through the application. The application ""reacts"" to the user stimulus. Functional reactive programming would just be the implementation of this idea in a functional language, or generally within a functional programming paradigm. For more on ""dataflow computing"", search for those two words on Wikipedia or using your favorite search engine. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs ""triggered"" or ""marked"". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. The graph might be implicit or explicit depending on exactly how reactive programming is implemented. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Dataflow computing is fairly well suited to situations in which triggering computations asynchronously giving rise to cascades of computations works better than trying to have execution be governed by a clock (or clocks). Reactive programming imports this ""cascade of execution"" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the ""outside world"" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. Program execution would then look like something analogous to a complex reflex arc. The program may or may not be basically sessile between stimuli or may settle into a basically sessile state between stimuli. ""non-reactive"" programming would be programming with a very different view of the flow of execution and relationship to external inputs. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs ""reacts"" to them. But looking at the spirit of the thing, a program that polls an event queue at a fixed interval and dispatches any events found to functions (or threads) is less reactive (because it only attends to user input at a fixed interval). Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.","Reactive programming is an implementation of dataflow computing in a functional language or paradigm.

For many types of software (for example, anything with user interaction) side-effects are necessary at some level. One way to get side-effect like behavior while still retaining a functional style is to use functional reactive programming. This is the combination of functional programming, and reactive programming. (The Wikipedia article you linked to is about the latter.) The basic idea behind reactive programming is that there are certain datatypes that represent a value ""over time"". Computations that involve these changing-over-time values will themselves have values that change over time. For example, you could represent the mouse coordinates as a pair of integer-over-time values. Let's say we had something like (this is pseudo-code): BIGBLOCK At any moment in time, x and y would have the coordinates of the mouse. Unlike non-reactive programming, we only need to make this assignment once, and the x and y variables will stay ""up to date"" automatically. This is why reactive programming and functional programming work so well together: reactive programming removes the need to mutate variables while still letting you do a lot of what you could accomplish with variable mutations. If we then do some computations based on this the resulting values will also be values that change over time. For example: BIGBLOCK In this example, <code>minX</code> will always be 16 less than the x coordinate of the mouse pointer. With reactive-aware libraries you could then say something like: BIGBLOCK And a 32x32 box will be drawn around the mouse pointer and will track it wherever it moves.

1028250,1030631,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"If you want to get a feel for FRP, you could start with the old Fran tutorial from 1998, which has animated illustrations. For papers, start with <em>Functional Reactive Animation</em> and then follow up on links on the publications link on my home page and the FRP link on the Haskell wiki. Personally, I like to think about what FRP <em>means</em> before addressing how it might be implemented. (Code without a specification is an answer without a question and thus ""not even wrong"". )So I don't describe FRP in representation/implementation terms as Thomas K does in another answer (graphs, nodes, edges, firing, execution, etc).There are many possible implementation styles, but no implementation says what FRP <em>is</em>. I do resonate with Laurence G's simple description that FRP is about ""datatypes that represent a value 'over time' "".Conventional imperative programming captures these dynamic values only indirectly, through state and mutations.The complete history (past, present, future) has no first class representation.Moreover, only <em>discretely evolving</em> values can be (indirectly) captured, since the imperative paradigm is temporally discrete.In contrast, FRP captures these evolving values <em>directly</em> and has no difficulty with <em>continuously</em> evolving values. FRP is also unusual in that it is concurrent without running afoul of the theoretical &amp; pragmatic rats' nest that plagues imperative concurrency.Semantically, FRP's concurrency is <em>fine-grained</em>, <em>determinate</em>, and <em>continuous</em>. (I'm talking about meaning, not implementation. An implementation may or may not involve concurrency or parallelism. )Semantic determinacy is very important for reasoning, both rigorous and informal.While concurrency adds enormous complexity to imperative programming (due to nondeterministic interleaving), it is effortless in FRP. So, what is FRP?You could have invented it yourself.Start with these ideas: <li>Dynamic/evolving values (i.e., values ""over time"") are first class values in themselves. You can define them and combine them, pass them into &amp; out of functions. I called these things ""behaviors"". <li>Behaviors are built up out of a few primitives, like constant (static) behaviors and time (like a clock), and then with sequential and parallel combination. <em>n</em> behaviors are combined by applying an n-ary function (on static values), ""point-wise"", i.e., continuously over time. <li>To account for discrete phenomena, have another type (family) of ""events"", each of which has a stream (finite or infinite) of occurrences. Each occurrence has an associated time and value. <li>To come up with the compositional vocabulary out of which all behaviors and events can be built, play with some examples. Keep deconstructing into pieces that are more general/simple. <li>So that you know you're on solid ground, give the whole model a compositional foundation, using the technique of denotational semantics, which just means that (a) each type has a corresponding simple &amp; precise mathematical type of ""meanings"", and (b) each primitive and operator has a simple &amp; precise meaning as a function of the meanings of the constituents.<em>Never, ever</em> mix implementation considerations into your exploration process. If this description is gibberish to you, consult (a) <em>Denotational design with type class morphisms</em>, (b) <em>Push-pull functional reactive programming</em> (ignoring the implementation bits), and (c) the <em>Denotational Semantics</em> Haskell wikibooks page. Beware that denotational semantics has two parts, from its two founders Christopher Strachey and Dana Scott: the easier &amp; more useful Strachey part and the harder and less useful (for software design) Scott part. If you stick with these principles, I expect you'll get something more-or-less in the spirit of FRP. Where did I get these principles? In software design, I always ask the same question: ""what does it mean? "".Denotational semantics gave me a precise framework for this question, and one that fits my aesthetics (unlike operational or axiomatic semantics, both of which leave me unsatisfied).So I asked myself what is behavior?I soon realized that the temporally discrete nature of imperative computation is an accommodation to a particular style of <em>machine</em>, rather than a natural description of behavior itself.The simplest precise description of behavior I can think of is simply ""function of (continuous) time"", so that's my model.Delightfully, this model handles continuous, deterministic concurrency with ease and grace. It's been quite a challenge to implement this model correctly and efficiently, but that's another story.","Functional reactive programming (FRP) captures dynamic values directly, unlike conventional imperative programming which captures them indirectly through state and mutations. Key principles include:

* Dynamic/evolving values are first-class values, defined and combined like any other.
* Behaviors are built from primitives like constant values, time, and sequential/parallel combinations.
* Events represent discrete phenomena with associated time and value.
* A compositional foundation is established using denotational semantics, ensuring simple and precise mathematical meanings for each type and operator.

1031273,1031385,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","If you think about the Greek roots of the term, it should become obvious. Poly = many: polygon = many-sided, polystyrene = many styrenes (a), polyglot = many languages, and so on. Morph = change or form: morphology = study of biological form, Morpheus = the Greek god of dreams able to take any form. So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). For example, in many languages, integers and floats are implicitly polymorphic since you can add, subtract, multiply and so on, irrespective of the fact that the types are different. They're rarely considered as objects in the usual term. But, in that same way, a class like <code>BigDecimal</code> or <code>Rational</code> or <code>Imaginary</code> can also provide those operations, even though they operate on different data types. The classic example is the <code>Shape</code> class and all the classes that can inherit from it (square, circle, dodecahedron, irregular polygon, splat and so on). With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. A point shape needs only two co-ordinates (assuming it's in a two-dimensional space of course). A circle needs a center and radius. A square or rectangle needs two co-ordinates for the top left and bottom right corners and (possibly) a rotation. An irregular polygon needs a series of lines. By making the class responsible for its code as well as its data, you can achieve polymorphism. In this example, every class would have its own <code>Draw()</code> function and the client code could simply do: to get the correct behavior for any shape. This is in contrast to the old way of doing things in which the code was separate from the data, and you would have had functions such as <code>drawSquare()</code> and <code>drawCircle()</code>. Object orientation, polymorphism and inheritance are all closely-related concepts and they're vital to know. There have been many ""silver bullets"" during my long career which basically just fizzled out but the OO paradigm has turned out to be a good one. Learn it, understand it, love it - you'll be glad you did :-) (a) I originally wrote that as a joke but it turned out to be correct and, therefore, not that funny. The momomer styrene happens to be made from carbon and hydrogen, <code>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub></code>, and polystyrene is made from groups of that, <code>(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)<sub>n</sub></code>. Perhaps I should have stated that a polyp was many occurrences of the letter <code>p</code> although, now that I've had to explain the joke, even that doesn't seem funny either.

1031273,1031408,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","Generally speaking, it's the ability to interface a number of different types of object using the same or a superficially similar API. There are various forms: Function overloading: defining multiple functions with the same name and different parameter types, such as sqrt(float), sqrt(double) and sqrt(complex). In most languages that allow this, the compiler will automatically select the correct one for the type of argument being passed into it, thus this is compile-time polymorphism. Virtual methods in OOP: a method of a class can have various implementations tailored to the specifics of its subclasses; each of these is said to override the implementation given in the base class. Given an object that may be of the base class or any of its subclasses, the correct implementation is selected on the fly, thus this is run-time polymorphism. Templates: a feature of some OO languages whereby a function, class, etc. can be parameterised by a type. For example, you can define a generic ""list"" template class, and then instantiate it as ""list of integers"", ""list of strings"", maybe even ""list of lists of strings"" or the like. Generally, you write the code once for a data structure of arbitrary element type, and the compiler generates versions of it for the various element types.","Polymorphism is the ability to interface multiple object types with the same or similar API. It comes in three forms: 

- Compile-time polymorphism through function overloading (e.g., `sqrt(float)`, `sqrt(double)`, `sqrt(complex)`), where the compiler selects the correct function based on the argument type.
- Run-time polymorphism through virtual methods in OOP, where the correct implementation is selected on the fly based on the object's class.
- Templates, allowing generic functions or classes to be parameterized by a type, enabling code reuse for data structures of arbitrary element types.","There are various forms: Given an object that may be of the base class or any of its subclasses, the correct implementation is selected on the fly, thus this is run-time polymorphism.

For example, if you were developing a class called <code>Fraction</code> and a class called <code>ComplexNumber</code>, both of these might include a method called <code>display()</code>, but each of them would implement that method differently. In PHP, for example, you might implement it like this: Outputs: Some of the other answers seem to imply that polymorphism is used only in conjunction with inheritance; for example, maybe <code>Fraction</code> and <code>ComplexNumber</code> both implement an abstract class called <code>Number</code> that has a method <code>display()</code>, which Fraction and ComplexNumber are then both obligated to implement. But you don't need inheritance to take advantage of polymorphism. At least in dynamically-typed languages like PHP (I don't know about C++ or Java), polymorphism allows the developer to call a method without necessarily knowing the type of object ahead of time, and trusting that the correct implementation of the method will be called. For example, say the user chooses the type of <code>Number</code> created: In this case, the appropriate <code>display()</code> method will be called, even though the developer can't know ahead of time whether the user will choose a fraction or a complex number.",,,"Polymorphism is the ability of the programmer to write methods of the same name that do different things for different types of objects, depending on the needs of those objects."

1055214,1055524,Is there a way to make HTML5 video fullscreen?,"HTML 5 provides no way to make a video fullscreen, but the parallel Fullscreen specification supplies the <code>requestFullScreen</code> method which allows arbitrary elements (including <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements) to be made fullscreen. It has experimental support in a number of browsers. Original answer: From the HTML5 spec (at the time of writing: June '09): User agents should not provide a  public API to cause videos to be shown  full-screen. A script, combined with a  carefully crafted video file, could  trick the user into thinking a  system-modal dialog had been shown,  and prompt the user for a password. There is also the danger of ""mere""  annoyance, with pages launching  full-screen videos when links are  clicked or pages navigated. Instead,  user-agent specific interface features  may be provided to easily allow the  user to obtain a full-screen playback  mode.

1074081,1076376,Hibernate Error: org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException: a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session,"I have had this error many times and it can be quite hard to track down... Basically, what hibernate is saying is that you have two objects which have the same identifier (same primary key) but they are not the same object. I would suggest you break down your code, i.e. comment out bits until the error goes away and then put the code back until it comes back and you should find the error it. It most often happens via cascading saves where there is a cascade save between object A and B, but object B has already been associated with the session but not on the same instance of B. What primary key generator are you using? The reason I ask is this error is related to how you're telling hibernate to ascertain the persistent state of an object (i.e. whether an object is persistent or not). The error could be happening because hibernate is trying to persist and object that is already persistent. In fact, if you use save hibernate will try and persist that object, and maybe there is already an object with that same primary key associated with the session. Example Assuming you have a hibernate class object for a table with 10 rows based on a primary key combination (column 1 and column 2). Now, you have removed 5 rows from the table at some point of time. Now, if you try to add the same 10 rows again, while hibernate tries to persist the objects in database, 5 rows which were already removed will be added without errors. Now the remaining 5 rows which are already existing, will throw this exception. So the easy approach would be checking if you have updated/removed any value in a table which is part of something and later are you trying to insert the same objects again","Hibernate Error: org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException: a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session. This occurs when Hibernate tries to persist an object already associated with the session, often due to cascading saves or primary key generator issues. Key points to check:

They only impact on the user when they want to stop your application using <code>kill</code> or Task Manager. Apart from building a caching system, there aren't that many reasons why you'd be so certain that there should only be on instance of something per process. How about a logging system? Might be better for that to be per-thread or more fine-grained so you can trace the origin of messages more automatically. How about the application's main window? It depends; maybe you'll want all the user's documents to be managed by the same process for some reason, in which case there would be multiple ""main windows"" in that process.","Singletons are problematic due to their restrictive instance management, requiring a single instance per process address space, which is often an implementation detail.

Apart from everything else (it's overkill to do this for one badly behaved application, and it probably won't solve your problem anyway), it can cause a lot of instability.

If using SQL Server 2008 (or higher) - see below. In fact, for most databases that I create, I add these UDF's in right near the start since I know there's a 99% chance I'm going to need them sooner or later. I create one for ""date only"" &amp; ""time only"" (although the ""date only"" one is by far the most used of the two). Here's some links to a variety of date-related UDF's: Essential SQL Server Date, Time and DateTime Functions Get Date Only Function That last link shows no less than 3 different ways to getting the date only part of a datetime field and mentions some pros and cons of each approach. If using a UDF, it should be noted that you should try to avoid using the UDF as part of a WHERE clause in a query as this will greatly hinder performance of the query. The main reason for this is that using a UDF in a WHERE clause renders that clause as non-sargable, which means that SQL Server can no longer use an index with that clause in order to improve the speed of query execution. With reference to my own usage of UDF's, I'll frequently use the ""raw"" date column within the WHERE clause, but apply the UDF to the SELECTed column. In this way, the UDF is only applied to the filtered result-set and not every row of the table as part of the filter. Of course, the absolute <em>best</em> approach for this is to use SQL Server 2008 (or higher) and separate out your dates and times, as the SQL Server database engine is then natively providing the individual date and time components, and can efficiently query these independently without the need for a UDF or other mechanism to extract either the date or time part from a composite datetime type.","To remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server, create a User Defined Function (UDF) for date-only and time-only, or use SQL Server 2008 (or higher) where native date and time components can be queried independently.

1191282,1195209,How to see the changes between two commits without commits in-between?,"Asking for the difference /between/ two commits without including the commits in-between makes little sense. Commits are just snapshots of the contents of the repository; asking for the difference between two necessarily includes them. So the question then is, what are you really looking for? As William suggested, cherry-picking can give you the delta of a single commit rebased on top of another. That is: This takes commit 'abcdef', compares it to its immediate ancestor, then applies that difference on top of '012345'. This new difference is then shown - the only change is the context comes from '012345' rather than 'abcdef's immediate ancestor. Of course, you may get conflicts and etc, so it's not a very useful process in most cases. If you're just interested in abcdef itself, you can do: This compares abcdef to its immediate ancestor, alone, and is usually what you want. And of course gives you all differences between those two commits. It would help to get a better idea of what you're trying to achieve - as I mentioned, asking for the difference between two commits without what's in between doesn't actually make sense.","To see changes between two commits, consider cherry-picking a single commit and rebasing it on top of another. This can be achieved using the following commands: 

`git cherry-pick abcdef && git rebase -i 012345`

Alternatively, compare a commit to its immediate ancestor: `git diff abcdef~1..abcdef`.","As William suggested, cherry-picking can give you the delta of a single commit rebased on top of another.

For example, you have two tables, Customer and Order: If you wish to quickly retrieve all orders of one particular customer, you may wish to create a clustered index on the ""CustomerID"" column of the Order table. This way the records with the same CustomerID will be physically stored close to each other on disk (clustered) which speeds up their retrieval. P.S. The index on CustomerID will obviously be not unique, so you either need to add a second field to ""uniquify"" the index or let the database handle that for you but that's another story. Regarding multiple indexes. You can have only one clustered index per table because this defines how the data is physically arranged. If you wish an analogy, imagine a big room with many tables in it. You can either put these tables to form several rows or pull them all together to form a big conference table, but not both ways at the same time.

28002,1255015,Regular cast vs. static_cast vs. dynamic_cast,"You should look at the article <em>C++ Programming/Type Casting</em>. It contains a good description of all of the different cast types. The following taken from the above link: const_cast const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types. 'e.g.' char->long, int->short etc. Static cast is also used to cast pointers to related types, for  example casting void* to the appropriate type. dynamic_cast Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy). dynamic_cast(expression) The target type must be a pointer or reference type, and the  expression must evaluate to a pointer or reference. Dynamic cast works  only when the type of object to which the expression refers is  compatible with the target type and the base class has at least one  virtual member function. If not, and the type of expression being cast  is a pointer, NULL is returned, if a dynamic cast on a reference  fails, a bad_cast exception is thrown. When it doesn't fail, dynamic  cast returns a pointer or reference of the target type to the object  to which expression referred. reinterpret_cast Reinterpret cast simply casts one type bitwise to another. Any pointer  or integral type can be casted to any other with reinterpret cast,  easily allowing for misuse. For instance, with reinterpret cast one  might, unsafely, cast an integer pointer to a string pointer.","C++ provides four types of casts: `const_cast`, `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`. 

- `const_cast` removes or adds const-ness to a variable.
- `static_cast` casts between integer types and related pointers (e.g., `char` to `long`).
- `dynamic_cast` converts pointers and references at runtime for inheritance, but requires a virtual member function in the base class and the target type must be compatible with the object's type.
- `reinterpret_cast` casts one type bitwise to another, allowing for potential misuse (e.g., casting an integer pointer to a string pointer).","Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy). reinterpret_cast Reinterpret cast simply casts one type bitwise to another.","const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types.

A quick search turned up an entry in James Bennett's blog here which mentions that when working with the UserProfile to extend the User model a common mistake in settings.py can cause Django to throw this error. To quote the blog entry: The value of the setting is not ""appname.models.modelname"", it's just ""appname.modelname"". The reason is that Django is not using this to do a direct import; instead, it's using an internal model-loading function which only wants the name of the app and the name of the model. Trying to do things like ""appname.models.modelname"" or ""projectname.appname.models.modelname"" in the AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE setting will cause Django to blow up with the dreaded ""too many values to unpack"" error, so make sure you've put ""appname.modelname"", and nothing else, in the value of AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE. If the OP had copied more of the traceback I would expect to see something like the one below which I was able to duplicate by adding ""models"" to my AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE setting. This I think is one of the few cases where Django still has a bit of import magic that tends to cause confusion when a small error doesn't throw the expected exception.

I'm 99% sure that this was the original problem encountered here.","Django throws a ""too many values to unpack"" exception when the AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE setting contains the full import path, not just the app and model name.

109023,1511920,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"This is one of those questions where it helps to know your micro-architecture. I just timed two variants under gcc 4.3.3 compiled with -O3 using C++ inlines to eliminate function call overhead, one billion iterations, keeping the running sum of all counts to ensure the compiler doesn't remove anything important, using rdtsc for timing (clock cycle precise). The unmodified Hacker's Delight took 12.2 gigacycles. My parallel version (counting twice as many bits) runs in 13.0 gigacycles. 10.5s total elapsed for both together on a 2.4GHz Core Duo. 25 gigacycles = just over 10 seconds at this clock frequency, so I'm confident my timings are right. This has to do with instruction dependency chains, which are very bad for this algorithm. I could nearly double the speed again by using a pair of 64-bit registers. In fact, if I was clever and added x+y a little sooner I could shave off some shifts. The 64-bit version with some small tweaks would come out about even, but count twice as many bits again. With 128 bit SIMD registers, yet another factor of two, and the SSE instruction sets often have clever short-cuts, too. There's no reason for the code to be especially transparent. The interface is simple, the algorithm can be referenced on-line in many places, and it's amenable to comprehensive unit test. The programmer who stumbles upon it might even learn something. These bit operations are extremely natural at the machine level. OK, I decided to bench the tweaked 64-bit version. For this one  sizeof(unsigned long) == 8 That looks about right (I'm not testing carefully, though). Now the timings come out at 10.70 gigacycles / 14.1 gigacycles. That later number summed 128 billion bits and corresponds to 5.9s elapsed on this machine. The non-parallel version speeds up a tiny bit because I'm running in 64-bit mode and it likes 64-bit registers slightly better than 32-bit registers. Let's see if there's a bit more OOO pipelining to be had here. This was a bit more involved, so I actually tested a bit. Each term alone sums to 64, all combined sum to 256. I was excited for a moment, but it turns out gcc is playing inline tricks with -O3 even though I'm not using the inline keyword in some tests. When I let gcc play tricks, a billion calls to pop4() takes 12.56 gigacycles, but I determined it was folding arguments as constant expressions. A more realistic number appears to be 19.6gc for another 30% speed-up. My test loop now looks like this, making sure each argument is different enough to stop gcc from playing tricks. 256 billion bits summed in 8.17s elapsed. Works out to 1.02s for 32 million bits as benchmarked in the 16-bit table lookup. Can't compare directly, because the other bench doesn't give a clock speed, but looks like I've slapped the snot out of the 64KB table edition, which is a tragic use of L1 cache in the first place. Update: decided to do the obvious and create pop6() by adding four more duplicated lines. Came out to 22.8gc, 384 billion bits summed in 9.5s elapsed. So there's another 20%   Now at 800ms for 32 billion bits.","Counting set bits in a 32-bit integer involves optimizing for instruction dependency chains and utilizing 64-bit registers to improve performance.

1595848,1595913,Configuring Git over SSH to login once,"I think there are two different things here. The first one is that normal SSH authentication requires the user to put the account's password (where the account password will be authenticated against different methods, depending on the sshd configuration). You can avoid putting that password using certificates. With certificates you still have to put a password, but this time is the password of your private key (that's independent of the account's password). To do this you can follow the instructions pointed out by steveth45: With Public Key Authentication. If you want to avoid putting the certificate's password every time then you can use ssh-agent, as pointed out by DigitalRoss The exact way you do this depends on Unix vs Windows, but essentially you need to run ssh-agent in the background when you log in, and then the first time you log in, run ssh-add to give the agent your passphrase. All ssh-family commands will then consult the agent and automatically pick up your passphrase. Start here: man ssh-agent. The only problem of ssh-agent is that, on *nix at least, you have to put the certificates password on every new shell. And then the certificate is ""loaded"" and you can use it to authenticate against an ssh server without putting any kind of password. But this is on that particular shell. With keychain you can do the same thing as ssh-agent but ""system-wide"". Once you turn on your computer, you open a shell and put the password of the certificate. And then, every other shell will use that ""loaded"" certificate and your password will never be asked again until you restart your PC. Gnome has a similar application, called Gnome Keyring that asks for your certificate's password the first time you use it and then it stores it securely so you won't be asked again.","Configuring Git over SSH to login once involves two main approaches. 

1. Certificate-based authentication: Uses a private key with a password, independent of the account password. This can be set up with ssh-agent, which stores the passphrase in memory, or keychain, which stores it system-wide.

```bash
eval ""$(ssh-agent -s)""
ssh-add
```
This allows Git to use the stored passphrase without prompting for it. Alternatively, keychain can be used to store the passphrase system-wide, eliminating the need to enter it for each new shell.","I think there are two different things here. You can avoid putting that password using certificates. With keychain you can do the same thing as ssh-agent but ""system-wide"".","I think there are two different things here. The first one is that normal SSH authentication requires the user to put the account's password (where the account password will be authenticated against different methods, depending on the sshd configuration). With certificates you still have to put a password, but this time is the password of your private key (that's independent of the account's password). If you want to avoid putting the certificate's password every time then you can use ssh-agent, as pointed out by DigitalRoss The exact way you do this depends on Unix vs Windows, but essentially you need to run ssh-agent in the background when you log in, and then the first time you log in, run ssh-add to give the agent your passphrase. All ssh-family commands will then consult the agent and automatically pick up your passphrase. But this is on that particular shell. With keychain you can do the same thing as ssh-agent but ""system-wide""."

1673967,1674950,How to run an EXE file in PowerShell with parameters with spaces and quotes,"When PowerShell sees a command starting with a string it just evaluates the string, that is, it typically echos it to the screen, for example: If you want PowerShell to interpret the string as a command name then use the call operator (&amp;) like so: After that you probably only need to quote parameter/argument pairs that contain spaces and/or quotation chars. When you invoke an EXE file like this with complex command line arguments it is usually very helpful to have a tool that will show you how PowerShell sends the arguments to the EXE file. The PowerShell Community Extensions has such a tool. It is called echoargs. You just replace the EXE file with echoargs - leaving all the arguments in place, and it will show you how the EXE file will receive the arguments, for example: Using echoargs you can experiment until you get it right, for example: It turns out I was trying too hard before to maintain the double quotes around the connection string. Apparently that isn't necessary because even cmd.exe will strip those out. BTW, hats off to the PowerShell team. They were quite helpful in showing me the specific incantation of single &amp; double quotes to get the desired result - if you needed to keep the internal double quotes in place. :-)  They also realize this is an area of pain, but they are driven by the number of folks are affected by a particular issue.

1835018,1835259,How to check if an object is a list or tuple (but not string)?,"Remember that in Python we want to use ""duck typing"". So, anything that acts like a list can be treated as a list. So, don't check for the type of a list, just see if it acts like a list. But strings act like a list too, and often that is not what we want. There are times when it is even a problem! So, check explicitly for a string, but then use duck typing. Here is a function I wrote for fun. It is a special version of <code>repr()</code> that prints any sequence in angle brackets ('&lt;', '>'). This is clean and elegant, overall. But what's that <code>isinstance()</code> check doing there? That's kind of a hack. But it is essential. This function calls itself recursively on anything that acts like a list. If we didn't handle the string specially, then it would be treated like a list, and split up one character at a time. But then the recursive call would try to treat each character as a list -- and it would work! Even a one-character string works as a list! The function would keep on calling itself recursively until stack overflow. Functions like this one, that depend on each recursive call breaking down the work to be done, have to special-case strings--because you can't break down a string below the level of a one-character string, and even a one-character string acts like a list. Note: the <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> is the cleanest way to express our intentions. But if this code were somehow time-critical, we might want to replace it with some sort of test to see if <code>arg</code> is a sequence. Rather than testing the type, we should probably test behaviors. If it has a <code>.strip()</code> method, it's a string, so don't consider it a sequence; otherwise, if it is indexable or iterable, it's a sequence: EDIT: I originally wrote the above with a check for <code>__getslice__()</code> but I noticed that in the <code>collections</code> module documentation, the interesting method is <code>__getitem__()</code>; this makes sense, that's how you index an object. That seems more fundamental than <code>__getslice__()</code> so I changed the above.","To check if an object is a list or tuple (excluding strings), use duck typing, checking if it's indexable or iterable, and handle strings explicitly. The function checks if the object has a `.strip()` method, indicating it's a string, or uses `try/except` to catch a `TypeError` when trying to index it, indicating it's a string. Otherwise, it's considered a sequence.","Remember that in Python we want to use ""duck typing"". So, check explicitly for a string, but then use duck typing.

You certainly can use <code>isinstance</code> or duck typing to check an argument, but why should you? That sounds like a rhetorical question, but it isn't. The answer to ""why should I check the argument's type?"" is probably going to suggest a solution to the real problem, not the perceived problem. Why is it a bug when a string is passed to the function? Also:  if it's a bug when a string is passed to this function, is it also a bug if some other non-list/tuple iterable is passed to it? Why, or why not? I think that the most common answer to the question is likely to be that developers who write <code>f(""abc"")</code> are expecting the function to behave as though they'd written <code>f([""abc""])</code>. There are probably circumstances where it makes more sense to protect developers from themselves than it does to support the use case of iterating across the characters in a string.

3881,1871889,IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?,"Voted up Jason Cohen's argument because it was well presented. Let me dismember it step by step. ;-) The NPE JavaDoc explicitly says, ""other illegal uses of the null object"". If it was just limited to situations where the runtime encounters a null when it shouldn't, all such cases could be defined far more succinctly. Can't help it if you assume the wrong thing, but assuming encapsulation is applied properly, you really shouldn't care or notice whether a null was dereferenced inappropriately vs. whether a method detected an inappropriate null and fired an exception off. I'd choose NPE over IAE for multiple reasons It is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation Logic that mistakenly allows nulls tends to be very different from logic that mistakenly allows illegal values. For example, if I'm validating data entered by a user, if I get value that is unacceptable, the source of that error is with the end user of the application. If I get a null, that's programmer error. Invalid values can cause things like stack overflows, out of memory errors, parsing exceptions, etc. Indeed, most errors generally present, at some point, as an invalid value in some method call. For this reason I see IAE as actually the MOST GENERAL of all exceptions under RuntimeException. Actually, other invalid arguments can result in all kinds of other exceptions. UnknownHostException, FileNotFoundException, a variety of syntax error exceptions, IndexOutOfBoundsException, authentication failures, etc., etc. In general, I feel NPE is much maligned because traditionally has been associated with code that fails to follow the fail fast principle. That, plus the JDK's failure to populate NPE's with a message string really has created a strong negative sentiment that isn't well founded. Indeed, the difference between NPE and IAE from a runtime perspective is strictly the name. From that perspective, the more precise you are with the name, the more clarity you give to the caller.","NPE (NullPointerException) is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation, indicating programmer error, whereas IAE (IllegalArgumentException) is more general, covering a wide range of invalid values that can cause exceptions, such as stack overflows, out-of-memory errors, or syntax errors.","It is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation If I get a null, that's programmer error.

Depending on your answer, one of the following sets ofsettings should work for you: <li><strong>For tab characters that appear 4-spaces-wide</strong>: If you're using actual tab character in your source code you probably also want these settings (these are actually the defaults, but you may want to set them defensively): Finally, if you want an indent to correspond to a single tab, you should also use: <li><strong>For indents that consist of 4 space characters</strong> but are entered with the tab key: <strong>To make the above settings permanent addthese lines to your vimrc.</strong> In case you need to make adjustments, or would simply like to understand what these options all mean, here's a breakdown of what each option means: The width of a hard tabstop measured in ""spaces"" -- effectively the (maximum) width of an actual tab character.

Enabling this will make the tab key (in insert mode) insert spaces instead of   tab characters. This also affects the behavior of the <code>retab</code> command.

This trick makes it possible for the server to ""inject"" javascript code directly in the Client browser and this with bypassing the ""same origin"" restrictions. In other words, you can have cross-domain data exchange. Normally, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> doesn't permit cross-domain data-exchange directly (one needs to go through a server in the same domain) whereas: <code>&lt;script src=""some_other_domain/some_data.js&amp;prefix=function_prefix</code>>` one can access data from a domain different than from the origin. Also worth noting: even though the server should be considered as ""trusted"" before attempting that sort of ""trick"", the side-effects of possible change in object format etc. can be contained. If a <code>function_prefix</code> (i.e. a proper js function) is used to receive the JSON object, the said function can perform checks before accepting/further processing the returned data.","JSONP (JSON with Padding) allows cross-domain data exchange by appending a prefix to the returned JSON object, enabling the browser to evaluate it as an expression.

2067472,2067584,What is JSONP all about?,"It's actually not too complicated... Say you're on domain example.com, and you want to make a request to domain example.net. To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland. The one item that bypasses this limitation is &lt;script&gt; tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really do anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated. Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle. For example, say the server expects a parameter called ""callback"" to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like: Without JSONP, this might return some basic JavaScript object, like so: However, with JSONP, when the server receives the ""callback"" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this: As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function: And now, when the script is loaded, it'll be evaluated, and your function will be executed. Voila, cross-domain requests! It's also worth noting the one major issue with JSONP: you lose a lot of control of the request. For example, there is no ""nice"" way to get proper failure codes back. As a result, you end up using timers to monitor the request, etc, which is always a bit suspect. The proposition for JSONRequest is a great solution to allowing cross domain scripting, maintaining security, and allowing proper control of the request. These days (2015), CORS is the recommended approach vs. JSONRequest. JSONP is still useful for older browser support, but given the security implications, unless you have no choice CORS is the better choice.","JSONP allows cross-domain requests by wrapping server responses in a callback function, enabling browsers to execute scripts from other domains.","Enter JSONP.

2095397,2097732,"What is the difference between JSF, Servlet and JSP?","JSP (JavaServer Pages) JSP is a Java view technology running on the server machine which allows you to write template text in client side languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ect.). JSP supports taglibs, which are backed by pieces of Java code that let you control the page flow or output dynamically. A well-known taglib is JSTL. JSP also supports Expression Language, which can be used to access backend data (via attributes available in the page, request, session and application scopes), mostly in combination with taglibs. When a JSP is requested for the first time or when the web app starts up, the servlet container will compile it into a class extending <code>HttpServlet</code> and use it during the web app's lifetime. You can find the generated source code in the server's work directory. In for example Tomcat, it's the <code>/work</code> directory. On a JSP request, the servlet container will execute the compiled JSP class and send the generated output (usually just HTML/CSS/JS) through the web server over a network to the client side, which in turn displays it in the web browser. Servlets Servlet is a Java application programming interface (API) running on the server machine, which intercepts requests made by the client and generates/sends a response. A well-known example is the <code>HttpServlet</code> which provides methods to hook on HTTP requests using the popular HTTP methods such as <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>. You can configure <code>HttpServlet</code>s to listen to a certain HTTP URL pattern, which is configurable in <code>web.xml</code>, or more recently with Java EE 6, with <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation. When a Servlet is first requested or during web app startup, the servlet container will create an instance of it and keep it in memory during the web app's lifetime. The same instance will be reused for every incoming request whose URL matches the servlet's URL pattern. You can access the request data by <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and handle the response by <code>HttpServletResponse</code>. Both objects are available as method arguments inside any of the overridden methods of <code>HttpServlet</code>, such as <code>doGet()</code> and <code>doPost()</code>. JSF (JavaServer Faces) JSF is a component based MVC framework which is built on top of the Servlet API and provides components via taglibs which can be used in JSP or any other Java based view technology such as Facelets. Facelets is much more suited to JSF than JSP. It namely provides great templating capabilities such as composite components, while JSP basically only offers the <code>&lt;jsp:include&gt;</code> for templating, so that you're forced to create custom components with raw Java code (which is a bit opaque and a lot of tedious work in JSF) when you want to replace a repeated group of components with a single component. Since JSF 2.0, JSP has been deprecated as view technology in favor of Facelets. As being a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, JSF provides the <code>FacesServlet</code> as the sole request-response Controller. It takes all the standard and tedious HTTP request/response work from your hands, such as gathering user input, validating/converting them, putting them in model objects, invoking actions and rendering the response. This way you end up with basically a JSP or Facelets (XHTML) page for View and a JavaBean class as Model. The JSF components are used to bind the view with the model (such as your ASP.NET web control does) and the <code>FacesServlet</code> uses the JSF component tree to do all the work.

2130416,2159506,What are the applications of binary trees?,"When most people talk about binary trees, they're more often than not thinking about binary <em>search</em> trees, so I'll cover that first. A non-balanced binary search tree is actually useful for little more than educating students about data structures. That's because, unless the data is coming in in a relatively random order, the tree can easily degenerate into its worst-case form, which is a linked list, since simple binary trees are <em>not</em> balanced. A good case in point: I once had to fix some software which loaded its data into a binary tree for manipulation and searching. It wrote the data out in sorted form: BIGBLOCK so that, when reading it back in, ended up with the following tree: BIGBLOCK which is the degenerate form. If you go looking for Frank in that tree, you'll have to search all six nodes before you find him. Binary trees become truly useful when you balance them. This involves rotating sub-trees through their root node so that the height difference between any two sub-trees is less than or equal to 1. Adding those names above one at a time into a balanced tree would give you the following sequence: BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK You can actually see whole sub-trees rotating to the left as the entries are added and this gives you a balanced binary tree in which the worst case lookup is O(log N) rather than O(N) as the degenerate form gives. At no point does the highest NULL (<code>=</code>) differ from the lowest by more than one level. And, in the final tree above, you can find Frank by only looking at three nodes (<code>Chloe</code>, <code>Edwina</code> and, finally, <code>Frank</code>). Of course, they become even more useful when you make them balanced <em>multi-way</em> trees rather than binary tress. That means that each node holds more than one item (technically, they hold N items and N+1 pointers, a binary tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree  with 1 item and 2 pointers). With a three-way tree, you end up with: BIGBLOCK This is typically used in maintaining keys for an index of items. I've written database software optimised for the hardware where a node is exactly the size of a disk block (say, 512 bytes) and you put as many keys as you can into a single node. The <em>pointers</em> in this case were actually record numbers into a fixed-length-record direct-access file separate from the index file (so record number <code>X</code> could be found by just seeking to <code>X * record_length</code>). For example, if the pointers are 4 bytes and the key size is 10, the number of keys in a 512-byte node is 36. That's 36 keys (360 bytes) and 37 pointers (148 bytes) for a total of 508 bytes with 4 bytes wasted per node. The use of multi-way keys introduces the complexity of a two-phase search (multi-way search to find the correct node combined with a small sequential search to find the correct key in the node) but the advantage in doing less disk I/O more than makes up for this. I see no reason to do this for an in-memory structure, you'd be better off sticking with a balanced binary tree and keeping your code simple. Also keep in mind that the advantages of O(log N) over O(N) don't really appear when your data sets are small. If you're using a multi-way tree to store the fifteen people in your address book, it's probably overkill. The advantages come when you're storing something like every order from your hundred thousand customers over the last ten years. The whole point of big-O notation is to indicate what happens as the N approaches infinity. Some people may disagree but it's even okay to use bubble sort if you're sure the data sets will stay below a certain size, as long as nothing else is readily available :-) As to other uses for binary trees, there are a great many, such as: <li>Binary heaps where higher keys are <em>above or equal to</em> lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right); <li>Hash trees, similar to hash tables; <li>Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages; <li>Huffman trees for compression of data; <li>Routing trees for network traffic. Given how much explanation I generated for the search trees, I'm reticent to go into a lot of detail on the others, but that should be enough to research them, should you desire.","Binary trees are useful for efficient data storage and retrieval, particularly when balanced. A balanced binary search tree allows for O(log N) lookup time, whereas a non-balanced tree can degenerate into a linked list with O(N) lookup time.

Multi-way trees, where each node holds more than one item, offer further improvements, but introduce complexity.

28002,2180920,Regular cast vs. static_cast vs. dynamic_cast,"static_cast <code>static_cast</code> is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. <code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Example: In this example, you know that you passed a <code>MyClass</code> object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this. dynamic_cast <code>dynamic_cast</code> is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a <code>bad_cast</code> exception is thrown in that case). You cannot use <code>dynamic_cast</code> if you downcast (cast to a derived class) and the argument type is not polymorphic. For example, the following code is not valid, because <code>Base</code> doesn't contain any virtual function: An ""up-cast"" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both <code>static_cast</code> and <code>dynamic_cast</code>, and also without any cast, as an ""up-cast"" is an implicit conversion. Regular Cast These casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering <code>dynamic_cast</code>. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of <code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code> and <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use <code>dynamic_cast</code>. In addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the ""equivalent"" <code>static_cast</code> sequence would give you a compile-time error for that. Some people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity. I use them for numeric casts only, and use the appropriate C++ casts when user defined types are involved, as they provide stricter checking.","static_cast is used for explicit conversions when the type is known, performing no runtime checks. 

dynamic_cast is used when the type is unknown, returning null or throwing an exception if the object is not of the casted type. 

C-style casts are equivalent to trying multiple casts in sequence, combining static_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast, but are considered unsafe as they don't use dynamic_cast and can perform private base-class casts.","<code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a <code>bad_cast</code> exception is thrown in that case).

The reason that binary trees are used more often than n-ary trees for searching is that n-ary trees are more complex, but usually provide no real speed advantage. In a (balanced) binary tree with <code>m</code> nodes, moving from one level to the next requires one comparison, and there are <code>log_2(m)</code> levels, for a total of <code>log_2(m)</code> comparisons. In contrast, an n-ary tree will require <code>log_2(n)</code> comparisons <em>(using a binary search)</em> to move to the next level. Since there are <code>log_n(m)</code> total levels, the search will require <code>log_2(n)*log_n(m)</code> = <code>log_2(m)</code> comparisons total. So, though n-ary trees are more complex, they provide no advantage in terms of total comparisons necessary. <em>(However, n-ary trees are still useful in niche-situations. The examples that come immediately to mind are quad-trees and other space-partitioning trees, where divisioning space using only two nodes per level would make the logic unnecessarily complex; and B-trees used in many databases, where the limiting factor is not how many comparisons are done at each level but how many nodes can be loaded from the hard-drive at once)</em>","Binary trees are a family of data structures with different performance characteristics.

The point of polymorphism is that you can subclass a class and the objects implementing those subclasses will have different behaviors for the same methods defined in the superclass (and overridden in the subclasses).

One was a concern with performance: there had been a lot of criticism of Smalltalk about it being too slow (garbage collection and polymorphic calls being part of that) and Java's creators were determined to avoid that. Another was the decision that the target audience for Java was C++ developers. Making static methods work the way they do had the benefit of familiarity for C++ programmers and was also very fast, because there's no need to wait until runtime to figure out which method to call.","Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods because they're not associated with any instance of a class, making polymorphism inapplicable.

2223386,2223408,Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?,"Static methods are treated as global by the JVM, there are not bound to an object instance at all.

2223386,2223803,Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?,"Personally I think this is a flaw in the design of Java. Yes, yes, I understand that non-static methods are attached to an instance while static methods are attached to a class, etc etc. Still, consider the following code: BIGBLOCK This code will not work as you might expect. Namely, SpecialEmployee's get a 2% bonus just like regular employees. But if you remove the ""static""s, then SpecialEmployee's get a 3% bonus. (Admittedly, this example is poor coding style in that in real life you would likely want the bonus multiplier to be in a database somewhere rather than hard-coded. But that's just because I didn't want to bog down the example with a lot of code irrelevant to the point.) It seems quite plausible to me that you might want to make getBonusMultiplier static. Perhaps you want to be able to display the bonus multiplier for all the categories of employees, without needing to have an instance of an employee in each category. What would be the point of searching for such example instances? What if we are creating a new category of employee and don't have any employees assigned to it yet? This is quite logically a static function. But it doesn't work. And yes, yes, I can think of any number of ways to rewrite the above code to make it work. My point is not that it creates an unsolvable problem, but that it creates a trap for the unwary programmer, because the language does not behave as I think a reasonable person would expect. Perhaps if I tried to write a compiler for an OOP language, I would quickly see why implementing it so that static functions can be overriden would be difficult or impossible. Or perhaps there is some good reason why Java behaves this way. Can anyone point out an advantage to this behavior, some category of problem that is made easier by this? I mean, don't just point me to the Java language spec and say ""see, this is documented how it behaves"". I know that. But is there a good reason why it SHOULD behave this way? (Besides the obvious ""making it work right was too hard""...) <strong>Update</strong> @VicKirk: If you mean that this is ""bad design"" because it doesn't fit how Java handles statics, my reply is, ""Well, duh, of course."" As I said in my original post, it doesn't work. But if you mean that it is bad design in the sense that there would be something fundamentally wrong with a language where this worked, i.e. where statics could be overridden just like virtual functions, that this would somehow introduce an ambiguity or it would be impossible to implement efficiently or some such, I reply, ""Why? What's wrong with the concept?"" I think the example I give is a very natural thing to want to do. I have a class that has a function that does not depend on any instance data, and which I might very reasonably want to call independent of an instance, as well as wanting to call from within an instance method. Why should this not work? I've run into this situation a fair number of times over the years. In practice I get around it by making the function virtual, and then creating a static method whose only purpose in life is to be a static method that passes the call on to the virtual method with a dummy instance. That seems like a very roundabout way to get there.",,,"Personally I think this is a flaw in the design of Java.

3058,2252457,What is Inversion of Control?,"Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so. Pros: Your code gets decoupled so you can easily exchange implementations of an interface with alternative implementations It is a strong motivator for coding against interfaces instead of implementations It's very easy to write unit tests for your code because it depends on nothing else than the objects it accepts in its constructor/setters and you can easily initialize them with the right objects in isolation. Cons: IoC not only inverts the control flow in your program, it also clouds it considerably. This means you can no longer just read your code and jump from one place to another because the connections that would normally be in your code are not in the code anymore. Instead it is in XML configuration files or annotations and in the code of your IoC container that interprets these metadata. There arises a new class of bugs where you get your XML config or your annotations wrong and you can spend a lot of time finding out why your IoC container injects a null reference into one of your objects under certain conditions. Personally I see the strong points of IoC and I really like them but I tend to avoid IoC whenever possible because it turns your software into a collection of classes that no longer constitute a ""real"" program but just something that needs to be put together by XML configuration or annotation metadata and would fall (and falls) apart without it.","Inversion of Control (IoC) decouples code, making it easier to exchange implementations and unit test.

2297403,2297421,What is the difference between HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME in PHP?,"The <code>HTTP_HOST</code> is obtained from the HTTP request header and this is what the client actually used as ""target host"" of the request. The <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is defined in server config. Which one to use depends on what you need it for. You should now however realize that the one is a client-controlled value which may thus not be reliable for use in business logic and the other is a server-controlled value which is more reliable. You however need to ensure that the webserver in question has the <code>SERVER_NAME</code> correctly configured. Taking Apache HTTPD as an example, here's an extract from its documentation: If no <code>ServerName</code> is specified, then the server attempts to deduce the hostname by performing a reverse lookup on the IP address. If no port is specified in the <code>ServerName</code>, then the server will use the port from the incoming request. For optimal reliability and predictability, you should specify an explicit hostname and port using the <code>ServerName</code> directive. Update: after checking the answer of Pekka on your question which contains a link to bobince's answer that PHP would always return <code>HTTP_HOST</code>'s value for <code>SERVER_NAME</code>, which goes against my own PHP 4.x + Apache HTTPD 1.2.x experiences from a couple of years ago, I blew some dust from my current XAMPP environment on Windows XP (Apache HTTPD 2.2.1 with PHP 5.2.8), started it, created a PHP page which prints the both values, created a Java test application using <code>URLConnection</code> to modify the <code>Host</code> header and tests taught me that this is indeed (incorrectly) the case. After first suspecting PHP and digging in some PHP bug reports regarding the subject, I learned that the root of the problem is in web server used, that it incorrectly returned HTTP <code>Host</code> header when <code>SERVER_NAME</code> was requested. So I dug into Apache HTTPD bug reports using various keywords regarding the subject and I finally found a related bug. This behaviour was introduced since around Apache HTTPD 1.3. You need to set <code>UseCanonicalName</code> directive to <code>on</code> in the <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> entry of the <code>ServerName</code> in <code>httpd.conf</code> (also check the warning at the bottom of the document! ). This worked for me. Summarized, <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is more reliable, but you're dependent on the server config!","HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME in PHP differ in their origin: HTTP_HOST is obtained from the HTTP request header, while SERVER_NAME is defined in server config.

The rationale for the presence of checked exceptions is that for some kinds of exceptions, you must not ignore the fact that they may happen, because their happening is quite a regular situation, not a program error.

2223386,2380491,Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?,"In Java (and many OOP languages, but I cannot speak for all; and some do not have static at all) all methods have a fixed signature - the parameters and types. In a virtual method, the first parameter is implied: a reference to the object itself and when called from within the object, the compiler automatically adds <code>this</code>. There is no difference for static methods - they still have a fixed signature. However, by declaring the method static you have explicitly stated that the compiler must not include the implied object parameter at the beginning of that signature. Therefore, any other code that calls this must <em>must not attempt to put a reference to an object on the stack</em>. If it did do that, then the method execution would not work since the parameters would be in the wrong place - shifted by one - on the stack. Because of this difference between the two; virtual methods always have a reference to the context object (i.e. <code>this</code>) so then it is possible to reference anything within the heap that belong to that instance of the object. But with static methods, since there is no reference passed, that method cannot access any object variables and methods since the context is not known. If you wish that Java would change the definition so that a object context is passed in for every method, static or virtual, then you would in essence have only virtual methods. As someone asked in a comment to the op - what is your reason and purpose for wanting this feature? I do not know Ruby much, as this was mentioned by the OP, I did some research. I see that in Ruby classes are really a special kind of object and one can create (even dynamically) new methods. Classes are full class objects in Ruby, they are not in Java. This is just something you will have to accept when working with Java (or C#). These are not dynamic languages, though C# is adding some forms of dynamic. In reality, Ruby does not have ""static"" methods as far as I could find - in that case these are methods on the singleton class object. You can then override this singleton with a new class and the methods in the previous class object will call those defined in the new class (correct?). So if you called a method in the context of the original class it still would only execute the original statics, but calling a method in the derived class, would call methods either from the parent or sub-class. Interesting and I can see some value in that. It takes a different thought pattern. Since you are working in Java, you will need to adjust to that way of doing things. Why they did this? Well, probably to improve performance at the time based on the technology and understanding that was available. Computer languages are constantly evolving. Go back far enough and there is no such thing as OOP. In the future, there will be other new ideas. <strong>EDIT</strong>: One other comment. Now that I see the differences and as I Java/C# developer myself, I can understand why the answers you get from Java developers may be confusing if you are coming from a language like Ruby. Java <code>static</code> methods are not the same as Ruby <code>class</code> methods. Java developers will have a hard time understanding this, as will conversely those who work mostly with a language like Ruby/Smalltalk. I can see how this would also be greatly confusing by the fact that Java also uses ""class method"" as another way to talk about static methods but this same term is used differently by Ruby. Java does not have Ruby style class methods (sorry); Ruby does not have Java style static methods which are really just old procedural style functions, as found in C. By the way - thanks for the question! I learned something new for me today about class methods (Ruby style).","Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods because they have a fixed signature without an implied object reference, unlike virtual methods.

But with static methods, since there is no reference passed, that method cannot access any object variables and methods since the context is not known. This is just something you will have to accept when working with Java (or C#)."

2422468,2424824,How to upload files to server using JSP/Servlet?,"Introduction To browse and select a file for upload you need a HTML <code>&lt;input type=""file""&gt;</code> field in the form. As stated in the HTML specification you have to use the <code>POST</code> method and the <code>enctype</code> attribute of the form has to be set to <code>""multipart/form-data""</code>. After submitting such a form, the binary multipart form data is available in the request body in a different format than when the <code>enctype</code> isn't set. Before Servlet 3.0, the Servlet API didn't natively support <code>multipart/form-data</code>. It supports only the default form enctype of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. The <code>request.getParameter()</code> and consorts would all return <code>null</code> when using multipart form data. This is where the well known Apache Commons FileUpload came into the picture. Don't manually parse it! You can in theory parse the request body yourself based on <code>ServletRequest#getInputStream()</code>. However, this is a precise and tedious work which requires precise knowledge of RFC2388. You shouldn't try to do this on your own or copypaste some homegrown library-less code found elsewhere on the Internet. Many online sources have failed hard in this, such as roseindia.net. See also uploading of pdf file. You should rather use a real library which is used (and implicitly tested!) by millions of users for years. Such a library has proven its robustness. When you're already on Servlet 3.0 or newer, use native API If you're using at least Servlet 3.0 (Tomcat 7, Jetty 9, JBoss AS 6, GlassFish 3, etc), then you can just use standard API provided <code>HttpServletRequest#getPart()</code> to collect the individual multipart form data items (most Servlet 3.0 implementations actually use Apache Commons FileUpload under the covers for this!). Also, normal form fields are available by <code>getParameter()</code> the usual way. First annotate your servlet with <code>@MultipartConfig</code> in order to let it recognize and support <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests and thus get <code>getPart()</code> to work: Then, implement its <code>doPost()</code> as follows: Note the <code>Path#getFileName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. In case you have a <code>&lt;input type=""file"" name=""file"" multiple=""true"" /&gt;</code> for multi-file upload, collect them as below (unfortunately there is no such method as <code>request.getParts(""file"")</code>): When you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, manually get submitted file name Note that <code>Part#getSubmittedFileName()</code> was introduced in Servlet 3.1 (Tomcat 8, Jetty 9, WildFly 8, GlassFish 4, etc). If you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, then you need an additional utility method to obtain the submitted file name. Note the MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. When you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet, use Apache Commons FileUpload If you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet (isn't it about time to upgrade? ), the common practice is to make use of Apache Commons FileUpload to parse the multpart form data requests. It has an excellent User Guide and FAQ (carefully go through both). There's also the O'Reilly (""cos"") <code>MultipartRequest</code>, but it has some (minor) bugs and isn't actively maintained anymore for years. I wouldn't recommend using it. Apache Commons FileUpload is still actively maintained and currently very mature. In order to use Apache Commons FileUpload, you need to have at least the following files in your webapp's <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code>: <code>commons-fileupload.jar</code> <code>commons-io.jar</code> Your initial attempt failed most likely because you forgot the commons IO. Here's a kickoff example how the <code>doPost()</code> of your <code>UploadServlet</code> may look like when using Apache Commons FileUpload: It's very important that you don't call <code>getParameter()</code>, <code>getParameterMap()</code>, <code>getParameterValues()</code>, <code>getInputStream()</code>, <code>getReader()</code>, etc on the same request beforehand. Otherwise the servlet container will read and parse the request body and thus Apache Commons FileUpload will get an empty request body. See also a.o. ServletFileUpload#parseRequest(request) returns an empty list. Note the <code>FilenameUtils#getName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. Alternatively you can also wrap this all in a <code>Filter</code> which parses it all automagically and put the stuff back in the parametermap of the request so that you can continue using <code>request.getParameter()</code> the usual way and retrieve the uploaded file by <code>request.getAttribute()</code>. You can find an example in this blog article. Workaround for GlassFish3 bug of <code>getParameter()</code> still returning <code>null</code> Note that Glassfish versions older than 3.1.2 had a bug wherein the <code>getParameter()</code> still returns <code>null</code>. If you are targeting such a container and can't upgrade it, then you need to extract the value from <code>getPart()</code> with help of this utility method: Saving uploaded file (don't use <code>getRealPath()</code> nor <code>part.write()</code>!)

Do note that the servlet code to collect the form data does not need to be changed for this!

It's true: the theory is scary. But  here's what I think: ""In theory there  is no difference between theory and  practice. In practice there is."" I would never recommend using <code>nolock</code>  as a general ""good for what ails you""  snake oil fix for any database  deadlocking problems you may have. You  should try to diagnose the source of  the problem first. But in practice adding <code>nolock</code> to queries that you absolutely know are simple, straightforward read-only affairs never seems to lead to problems... <strong>As long as you know what you're doing.</strong> One alternative to the <code>READ UNCOMMITTED</code> level that you may want to consider is the <code>READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT</code>. Quoting Jeff again: Snapshots rely on an entirely new data change tracking method ... more than just a slight logical change, it requires the server to handle the data physically differently. Once this new data change tracking method is enabled, it creates a copy, or snapshot of every data change. <strong>By reading these snapshots rather than live data at times of contention, Shared Locks are no longer needed on reads, and overall database performance may increase.</strong>","READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level allows dirty reads, enabling one transaction to see uncommitted changes from another transaction.

2480650,2480744,Role of Bias in Neural Networks,"Two different kinds of parameters can  be adjusted during the training of an  ANN, the weights and the value in the  activation functions. This is  impractical and it would be easier if  only one of the parameters should be  adjusted. To cope with this problem a  bias neuron is invented. The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1. Since the bias neuron  emits 1 the weights, connected to the  bias neuron, are added directly to the  combined sum of the other weights  (equation 2.1), just like the t value  in the activation functions.1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. Consider the AND boolean function represented by the following neural network: ANN http://www.aihorizon.com/images/essays/perceptron.gif <li><em>w0</em> corresponds to <em>b</em>. <li><em>w1</em> corresponds to <em>x1</em>. <li><em>w2</em> corresponds to <em>x2</em>. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions. For example, if we assume boolean values  of 1 (true) and -1 (false), then one  way to use a two-input perceptron to  implement the AND function is to set  the weights w0 = -3, and w1 = w2 = .5. This perceptron can be made to  represent the OR function instead by  altering the threshold to w0 = -.3. In  fact, AND and OR can be viewed as  special cases of m-of-n functions:  that is, functions where at least m of  the n inputs to the perceptron must be  true. The OR function corresponds to  m = 1 and the AND function to m = n.  Any m-of-n function is easily  represented using a perceptron by  setting all input weights to the same  value (e.g., 0.5) and then setting the  threshold w0 accordingly. Perceptrons can represent all of the  primitive boolean functions AND, OR,  NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR).

2559527,2559596,Non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context,"You must understand the difference between a class and an instance of that class. If you see a car on the street, you know immediately that it's a car even if you can't see which model or type. This is because you compare what you see with the class ""car"". The class contains which is similar to all cars. Think of it as a template or an idea. At the same time, the car you see is an instance of the class ""car"" since it has all the properties which you expect: There is someone driving it, it has an engine, wheels. So the class says ""all cars have a color"" and the instance says ""this specific car is red"". In the OO world, you define the class and inside the class, you define a field of type <code>Color</code>. When the class is instantiated (when you create a specific instance), memory is reserved for the color and you can give this specific instance a color. Since these attributes are specific, they are non-static. Static fields and methods are shared with all instances. They are for values which are specific to the class and not a specific instance. For methods, this usually are global helper methods (like <code>Integer.parseInt()</code>). For fields, it's usually constants (like car types, i.e. something where you have a limited set which doesn't change often). To solve your problem, you need to instantiate an instance (create an object) of your class so the runtime can reserve memory for the instance (otherwise, different instances would overwrite each other which you don't want). In your case, try this code as a starting block: The new <code>main()</code> method creates an instance of the class it contains (sounds strange but since <code>main()</code> is created with the class instead of with the instance, it can do this) and then calls an instance method (<code>run()</code>).","Non-static variables cannot be referenced from a static context because they belong to an instance of a class, reserving memory for specific values, whereas static fields and methods are shared among all instances and are typically used for constants or global helper methods.

137975,2592795,What is so bad about singletons?,"I'd like to address the 4 points in the accepted answer, hopefully someone can explain why I'm wrong. Why is hiding dependencies in your code bad? There are already dozens of hidden dependencies (C runtime calls, OS API calls, global function calls), and singleton dependencies are easy to find (search for instance()). ""Making something global to avoid passing it around is a code smell."" Why isn't passing something around to avoid making it a singleton a code smell? If you're passing an object through 10 functions in a call stack just to avoid a singleton, is that so great? Single Responsibility Principle: I think this is a bit vague and depends on your definition of responsibility. A relevant question would be, why does adding this specific ""responsibility"" to a class matter? Why does passing an object to a class make it more tightly coupled than using that object as a singleton from within the class? Why does it change how long the state lasts? Singletons can be created or destroyed manually, so the control is still there, and you can make the lifetime the same as a non-singleton object's lifetime would be. Regarding unit tests: not all classes need to be unit tested not all classes that need to be unit tested need to change the implementation of the singleton if they do need be unit tested and do need to change the implementation, it's easy to change a class from using a singleton to having the singleton passed to it via dependency injection.","Singletons are problematic due to hidden dependencies, tight coupling, and testability issues. They can be considered a code smell when used to avoid passing objects around, but this is not inherently a problem. The Single Responsibility Principle is subjective and doesn't necessarily apply to singletons. Singletons can still be controlled and destroyed manually, making their lifetime comparable to non-singleton objects.","""Making something global to avoid passing it around is a code smell.""

2726657,2726683,INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN performance in SQL Server,"A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results. It would also be expected to return more rows, further increasing the total execution time simply due to the larger size of the result set. (And even if a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> <em>were</em> faster in <em>specific</em> situations due to some difficult-to-imagine confluence of factors, it is not functionally equivalent to an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, so you cannot simply go replacing all instances of one with the other!) Most likely your performance problems lie elsewhere, such as not having a candidate key or foreign key indexed properly. 9 tables is quite a lot to be joining so the slowdown could literally be almost anywhere. If you post your schema, we might be able to provide more details. <strong>Edit:</strong> Reflecting further on this, I could think of one circumstance under which a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> might be faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, and that is when: <li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows); <li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query. Consider this example: BIGBLOCK If you run this and view the execution plan, you'll see that the <code>INNER JOIN</code> query does indeed cost more than the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, because it satisfies the two criteria above. It's because SQL Server wants to do a hash match for the <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but does nested loops for the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>; the former is <em>normally</em> much faster, but since the number of rows is so tiny <em>and</em> there's no index to use, the hashing operation turns out to be the most expensive part of the query. You can see the same effect by writing a program in your favourite programming language to perform a large number of lookups on a list with 5 elements, vs. a hash table with 5 elements. Because of the size, the hash table version is actually slower. But increase it to 50 elements, or 5000 elements, and the list version slows to a crawl, because it's O(N) vs. O(1) for the hashtable. But change this query to be on the <code>ID</code> column instead of <code>Name</code> and you'll see a very different story. In that case, it does nested loops for both queries, but the <code>INNER JOIN</code> version is able to replace one of the clustered index scans with a seek - meaning that this will literally be <em>an order of magnitude</em> faster with a large number of rows. So the conclusion is more or less what I mentioned several paragraphs above; this is almost certainly an indexing or index coverage problem, possibly combined with one or more very small tables. Those are the only circumstances under which SQL Server <em>might</em> sometimes choose a worse execution plan for an <code>INNER JOIN</code> than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.","INNER JOINs and LEFT JOINs have similar performance in SQL Server, with LEFT JOINs being slower due to additional work and larger result sets. However, there are rare cases where LEFT JOINs might be faster, such as when dealing with very small tables (less than 10 rows) and no suitable indexes. In such cases, the execution plan may favor nested loops over hash matches, resulting in faster performance for LEFT JOINs.","In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results. <li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows); <li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query.","A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>.

Using this approach means passing the directory path... The alternative approach is to declare a directory object. Directory objects require the exact file path, and don't accept wildcards. In this approach we pass the directory object name... The UTL_FILE_DIR is deprecated because it is inherently insecure - all users have access to all the OS directories specified in the path, whereas read and write privileges can de granted discretely to individual users. Also, with Directory objects we can be add, remove or change directories without bouncing the database. In either case, the <code>oracle</code> OS user must have read and/or write privileges <em>on the OS directory</em>. In case it isn't obvious, this means <em>the directory must be visible from the database server</em>.

Ans: Following are the differences __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ i) Scope __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ The scope of mutex is within a process address space which has created it and is used for synchronization of threads. Whereas semaphore can be used across process space and hence it can be used for interprocess synchronization. ii) Mutex is lightweight and faster than semaphore. Futex is even faster. iii) Mutex can be acquired by same thread successfully multiple times with condition that it should release it same number of times. Other thread trying to acquire will block. Whereas in case of semaphore if same process tries to acquire it again it blocks as it can be acquired only once.","Binary semaphore and mutex differ in their scope, acquisition behavior, and performance. 

- Mutex has a process scope, used for thread synchronization within a process address space, while a semaphore can be used across process space for inter-process synchronization.
- Mutex is generally faster and more lightweight than a semaphore, with futex being even faster.
- Mutex can be acquired multiple times by the same thread if released the same number of times, while a semaphore blocks the same process if it tries to acquire it again after acquiring it once.",ii) Mutex is lightweight and faster than semaphore.

2926869,2926928,Do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null?,"Objects never go out of scope in C# as they do in C++. They are dealt with by the Garbage Collector automatically when they are not used anymore. This is a more complicated approach than C++ where the scope of a variable is entirely deterministic. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. An object can go ""out of scope"" in one function but if its value is returned, then GC would look at whether or not the calling function holds onto the return value. Setting object references to <code>null</code> is unnecessary as garbage collection works by working out which objects are being referenced by other objects. In practice, you don't have to worry about destruction, it just works and it's great :) <code>Dispose</code> must be called on all objects that implement <code>IDisposable</code> when you are finished working with them. Normally you would use a <code>using</code> block with those objects like so: BIGBLOCK <strong>EDIT</strong> On variable scope. Craig has asked whether the variable scope has any effect on the object lifetime. To properly explain that aspect of CLR, I'll need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#. Actual variable scope In both languages the variable can only be used in the same scope as it was defined - class, function or a statement block enclosed by braces. The subtle difference, however, is that in C#, variables cannot be redefined in a nested block. In C++, this is perfectly legal: BIGBLOCK In C#, however you get a a compiler error: BIGBLOCK This makes sense if you look at generated MSIL - all the variables used by the function are defined at the start of the function. Take a look at this function: BIGBLOCK Below is the generated IL. Note that iVal2, which is defined inside the if block is actually defined at function level. Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned. BIGBLOCK C++ scope and object lifetime Whenever a C++ variable, allocated on the stack, goes out of scope it gets destructed. Remember that in C++ you can create objects on the stack or on the heap. When you create them on the stack, once execution leaves the scope, they get popped off the stack and gets destroyed. BIGBLOCK When C++ objects are created on the heap, they must be explicitly destroyed, otherwise it is a memory leak. No such problem with stack variables though. C# Object Lifetime In CLR, objects (i.e. reference types) are <strong>always</strong> created on the managed heap. This is further reinforced by object creation syntax. Consider this code snippet. BIGBLOCK In C++ this would create an instance on <code>MyClass</code> on the stack and call its default constructor. In C# it would create a reference to class <code>MyClass</code> that doesn't point to anything. The only way to create an instance of a class is by using <code>new</code> operator: BIGBLOCK In a way, C# objects are a lot like objects that are created using <code>new</code> syntax in C++ - they are created on the heap but unlike C++ objects, they are managed by the runtime, so you don't have to worry about destructing them. Since the objects are <strong>always</strong> on the heap the fact that object references (i.e. pointers) go out of scope becomes moot. There are more factors involved in determining if an object is to be collected than simply presence of references to the object. C# Object references Jon Skeet compared object references in Java to pieces of string that are attached to the balloon, which is the object. Same analogy applies to C# object references. They simply point to a location of the heap that contains the object. Thus, setting it to null has no immediate effect on the object lifetime, the balloon continues to exist, until the GC ""pops"" it. Continuing down the balloon analogy, it would seem logical that once the balloon has no strings attached to it, it can be destroyed. In fact this is exactly how reference counted objects work in non-managed languages. Except this approach doesn't work for circular references very well. Imagine two balloons that are attached together by a string but neither balloon has a string to anything else. Under simple ref counting rules, they both continue to exist, even though the whole balloon group is ""orphaned"". .NET objects are a lot like helium balloons under a roof. When the roof opens (GC runs) - the unused balloons float away, even though there might be groups of balloons that are tethered together. .NET GC uses a combination of generational GC and mark and sweep. Generational approach involves the runtime favouring to inspect objects that have been allocated most recently, as they are more likely to be unused and mark and sweep involves runtime going through the whole object graph and working out if there are object groups that are unused. This adequately deals with circular dependency problem. Also, .NET GC runs on another thread(so called finalizer thread) as it has quite a bit to do and doing that on the main thread would interrupt your program.","In C#, objects are automatically managed by the Garbage Collector, eliminating the need to manually set them to null or call Dispose.

2926869,2927190,Do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null?,"Normally, there's no need to set fields to null. I'd always recommend disposing unmanaged resources however. From experience I'd also advise you to do the following: <li>Unsubscribe from events if you no longer need them. <li>Set any field holding a delegate or an expression to null if it's no longer needed. I've come across some very hard to find issues that were the direct result of not following the advice above. A good place to do this is in Dispose(), but sooner is usually better. In general, if a reference exists to an object the garbage collector (GC) may take a couple of generations longer to figure out that an object is no longer in use. All the while the object remains in memory. That may not be a problem until you find that your app is using a lot more memory than you'd expect. When that happens, hook up a memory profiler to see what objects are not being cleaned up.

2955459,2955501,What is an index in SQL?,Well in general index is a <code>B-tree</code>. There are two types of indexes: clustered and nonclustered. Clustered index creates a physical order of rows (it can be only one and in most cases it is also a primary key - if you create primary key on table you create clustered index on this table also). Nonclustered index is also a binary tree but it doesn't create a physical order of rows. So the leaf nodes of nonclustered index contain PK (if it exists) or row index. Indexes are used to increase the speed of search. Because the complexity is of O(log N). Indexes is very large and interesting topic. I can say that creating indexes on large database is some kind of art sometimes.,"An index in SQL is a B-tree data structure that can be either clustered or nonclustered.

109023,3026418,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"I wrote a fast bitcount macro for RISC machines in about 1990. It does not use advanced arithmetic (multiplication, division, %), memory fetches (way too slow), branches (way too slow), but it does assume the CPU has a 32-bit barrel shifter (in other words, >> 1 and >> 32 take the same amount of cycles.) It assumes that small constants (such as 6, 12, 24) cost nothing to load into the registers, or are stored in temporaries and reused over and over again. With these assumptions, it counts 32 bits in about 16 cycles/instructions on most RISC machines. Note that 15 instructions/cycles is close to a lower bound on the number of cycles or instructions, because it seems to take at least 3 instructions (mask, shift, operator) to cut the number of addends in half, so log_2(32) = 5, 5 x 3 = 15 instructions is a quasi-lowerbound. Here is a secret to the first and most complex step: so if I take the 1st column (A) above, shift it right 1 bit, and subtract it from AB, I get the output (CD).

HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and    password so that it can verify that you're allowed to do the request you're    doing. The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by    default) is plain text based, which means it sends username and password    only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on    the network between you and the remote server. To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication: The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers    returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even    --anyauth might be options that suit you. Sometimes your HTTP access is only available through the use of a HTTP    proxy. This seems to be especially common at various companies. A HTTP proxy    may require its own user and password to allow the client to get through to    the Internet. To specify those with curl, run something like: If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,    use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest. If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password    part, curl will prompt for the password interactively. Do note that when a program is run, its parameters might be possible to see    when listing the running processes of the system. Thus, other users may be    able to watch your passwords if you pass them as plain command line    options. There are ways to circumvent this. It is worth noting that while this is how HTTP Authentication works, very    many web sites will not use this concept when they provide logins etc. See    the Web Login chapter further below for more details on that.","To set the authorization header using curl, use the `--user` option followed by the username and password, e.g., `--user username:password`. For NTLM or Digest authentication, use `--proxy-ntlm` or `--proxy-digest` respectively. If the proxy requires authentication, use the format `--proxy-user username:password`. Note that passing passwords as plain command line options can be insecure, so consider using interactive prompts or other secure methods.","To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication: If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,    use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest.",See part 6.

137975,3114857,What is so bad about singletons?,"Monopoly is the devil and singletons with non-readonly/mutable state are the 'real' problem... After reading Singletons are Pathological Liars as suggested in jason's answer I came across this little tidbit that provides the best presented example of how singletons are often misused. Global is bad because:   a. It causes namespace conflict   b. It exposes the state in a unwarranted fashion When it comes to Singletons   a. The explicit OO way of calling them, prevents the conflicts, so point a. is not an issue   b. Singletons without state are (like factories) are not a problem. Singletons with state can again fall in two categories, those which are immutable or write once and read many (config/property files). These are not bad. Mutable Singletons, which are kind of reference holders are the ones which you are speaking of. In the last statement he's referring to the blog's concept of 'singletons are liars'. How does this apply to Monopoly? To start a game of monopoly, first: we establish the rules first so everybody is on the same page everybody is given an equal start at the beginning of the game only one set of rules is presented to avoid confusion the rules aren't allowed to change throughout the game Now, for anybody who hasn't really played monopoly, these standards are ideal at best. A defeat in monopoly is hard to swallow because, monopoly is about money, if you lose you have to painstakingly watch the rest of the players finish the game, and losses are usually swift and crushing. So, the rules usually get twisted at some point to serve the self-interest of some of the players at the expense of the others. So you're playing monopoly with friends Bob, Joe, and Ed. You're swiftly building your empire and consuming market share at an exponential rate. Your opponents are weakening and you start to smell blood (figuratively). Your buddy Bob put all of his money into gridlocking as many low-value properties as possible but his isn't receiving a high return on investment the way he expected. Bob, as a stroke of bad luck, lands on your Boardwalk and is excised from the game. Now the game goes from friendly dice-rolling to serious business. Bob has been made the example of failure and Joe and Ed don't want to end up like 'that guy'. So, being the leading player you, all of a sudden, become the enemy. Joe and Ed start practicing under-the-table trades, behind-the-back money injections, undervalued house-swapping and generally anything to weaken you as a player until one of them rises to the top. Then, instead of one of them winning, the process starts all over. All of a sudden, a finite set of rules becomes a moving target and the game degenerates into the type of social interactions that would make up the foundation of every high-rated reality TV show since Survivor. Why, because the rules are changing and there's no consensus on how/why/what they're supposed to represent, and more importantly, there's no one person making the decisions. Every player in the game, at that point, is making his/her own rules and chaos ensues until two of the players are too tired to keep up the charade and slowly give up. So, if a rulebook for a game accurately represented a singleton, the monopoly rulebook would be an example of abuse. How does this apply to programming? Aside from all of the obvious thread-safety and synchronization issues that mutable singletons present... If you have one set of data, that is capable of being read/manipulated by multiple different sources concurrently and exists during the lifetime of the application execution, it's probably a good time to step back and ask ""am I using the right type of data structure here"". Personally, I have seen a programmer abuse a singleton by using it as some sort of twisted cross-thread database store within an application. Having worked on the code directly, I can attest that it was a slow (because of all the thread locks needed to make it thread-safe) and a nightmare to work on (because of the unpredictable/intermittent nature of synchronization bugs), and nearly impossible to test under 'production' conditions. Sure, a system could have been developed using polling/signaling to overcome some of the performance issues but that wouldn't solve the issues with testing and, why bother when a 'real' database can already accomplish the same functionality in a much more robust/scalable manner. A Singleton is only an option if you need what a singleton provides. A write-one read-only instance of an object. That same rule should cascade to the object's properties/members as well.","Singletons are problematic when they have mutable state, as this leads to issues like namespace conflicts, exposure of state in an unwarranted fashion, thread-safety problems, and synchronization bugs.",It causes namespace conflict It exposes the state in a unwarranted fashion When it comes to Singletons,Monopoly is the devil and singletons with non-readonly/mutable state are the 'real' problem...

3141087,3141107,"What is meant with ""const"" at end of function declaration?","A ""const function"", denoted with the keyword <code>const</code> after a function declaration, makes it a compiler error for this class function to change a member variable of the class. However, reading of a class variables is ok inside of the function, but writing inside of this function will generate a compiler error. Another way of thinking about such ""const function"" is by viewing an class function as a normal function taking an implicit <code>this</code> pointer. So a method <code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg)</code> (without the const at the end) results in a function like <code>int Foo_Bar(Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>, and a call such as <code>Foo f; f.Bar(4)</code> will internally correspond to something like <code>Foo f; Foo_Bar(&amp;f, 4)</code>. Now adding the const at the end (<code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg) const</code>) can then be understood as a declaration with a const this pointer: <code>int Foo_Bar(const Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>. Since the type of <code>this</code> in such case is const, no modifications of member variables are possible. It is possible to loosen the ""const function"" restriction of not allowing the function to write to any variable of a class. To allow some of the variables to be writable even when the function is marked as a ""const function"", these class variables are marked with the keyword <code>mutable</code>. Thus, if a class variable is marked as mutable, and a ""const function"" writes to this variable then the code will compile cleanly and the variable is possible to change.

That's it. It's just a convention. Lots of libraries depend on it though. With respect to <code>Serializable</code>, from the API documentation: Serializability of a class is enabled by the class implementing the   java.io.Serializable interface. Classes that do not implement this   interface will not have any of their state serialized or deserialized.   All subtypes of a serializable class are themselves serializable. The   serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to   identify the semantics of being serializable. In other words, serializable objects can be written to streams, and hence files, object databases, anything really. Also, there is no syntactic difference between a JavaBean and another class -- a class defines a JavaBean if it follows the standards. There is a term for it because the standard allows libraries to programmatically do things with class instances you define in a predefined way. For example, if a library wants to stream any object you pass into it, it knows it can because your object is serializable (assuming the lib requires your objects be proper JavaBeans).","A JavaBean is a class that follows a standard convention: all properties are private with public getters and setters, has a public no-argument constructor, and implements the `Serializable` interface.

3295496,3295540,What is a JavaBean exactly?,"There's a term for it to make it sound special. The reality is nowhere near so mysterious. Basically, a ""Bean"": is a serializable object (that is, it implements <code>java.io.Serializable</code>, and does so correctly), that has ""properties"" whose getters and setters are just methods with certain names (like, say, <code>getFoo()</code> is the getter for the ""Foo"" property), and has a public default constructor (so it can be created at will and configured by setting its properties). Update: As for <code>Serializable</code>:  That is nothing but a ""marker interface"" (an interface that doesn't declare any functions) that tells Java that the implementing class consents to (and implies that it is capable of) ""serialization"" -- a process that converts an instance into a stream of bytes. Those bytes can be stored in files, sent over a network connection, etc, and have enough info to allow a JVM (at least, one that knows about the object's type) to reconstruct the object later -- possibly in a different instance of the application, or even on a whole other machine! Of course, in order to do that, the class has to abide by certain limitations. Chief among them is that all instance fields must be either primitive types (int, bool, etc), instances of some class that is also serializable, or marked as <code>transient</code> so that Java won't try to include them. (This of course means that <code>transient</code> fields will not survive the trip over a stream. A class that has <code>transient</code> fields should be prepared to reinitialize them if necessary.) A class that can not abide by those limitations should not implement <code>Serializable</code> (and, IIRC, the Java compiler won't even let it do so.)","A JavaBean is a serializable object that implements `java.io.Serializable`, has properties with getter and setter methods (e.g., `getFoo()` and `setFoo()`), and a public default constructor.

According to Wikipedia: GET requests a representation of the specified resource.

One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. and POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616) section 9 Method Definitions contains more information on <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> as well as the other HTTP methods, if you are interested. In addition to explaining the intended uses of each method, the spec also provides at least one practical reason for why <code>GET</code> should only be used to retrieve data: Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing servers, proxies, and user agents will log the request URI in some place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use POST-based form submission instead Finally, an important consideration when using <code>GET</code> for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a <code>GET</code> request. So if you, for example, poll using the same <code>GET</code> request you will always get back the same results, even if the data you are querying is being updated server-side.

667781,3540895,What is the difference between MVC and MVVM?,"MVC/MVVM is not an either/or choice. The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development. For ASP.Net, MVVM is used to two-way bind data within views. This is usually a client-side implementation (e.g. using Knockout.js). MVC on the other hand is a way of separating concerns on the server-side. For Silverlight and WPF, the MVVM pattern is more encompassing and can appear to act as a replacement for MVC (or other patterns of organising software into separate responsibilities). One assumption, that frequently came out of this pattern, was that the <code>ViewModel</code> simply replaced the controller in <code>MVC</code> (as if you could just  substitute <code>VM</code> for <code>C</code> in the acronym and all would be forgiven)... The ViewModel does not necessarily replace the need for separate Controllers. The problem is: that to be independently testable*, and especially reusable when needed, a view-model has no idea what view is displaying it, but more importantly no idea where its data is coming from. *Note: in practice Controllers remove most of the logic, from the ViewModel, that requires unit testing. The VM then becomes a dumb container that requires little, if any, testing. This is a good thing as the VM is just a bridge, between the designer and the coder, so should be kept simple. Even in MVVM, controllers will typically contain all processing logic and decide what data to display in which views using which view models. From what we have seen so far the main benefit of the ViewModel pattern to remove code from XAML code-behind to make XAML editing a more independent task. We still create controllers, as and when needed, to control (no pun intended) the overall logic of our applications. The basic MVCVM guidelines we follow are: Views display a certain shape of data. They have no idea where the data comes from. ViewModels hold a certain shape of data and commands, they do not know where the data, or code, comes from or how it is displayed. Models hold the actual data (various context, store or other methods) Controllers listen for, and publish, events. Controllers provide the logic that controls what data is seen and where. Controllers provide the command code to the ViewModel so that the ViewModel is actually reusable. We also noted that the Sculpture code-gen framework implements MVVM and a pattern similar to Prism AND it also makes extensive use of controllers to separate all use-case logic. Don't assume controllers are made obsolete by View-models. I have started a blog on this topic which I will add to as and when I can. There are issues with combining MVCVM with the common navigation systems, as most navigation systems just use Views and VMs, but I will go into that in later articles. An additional benefit of using an MVCVM model is that only the controller objects need to exist in memory for the life of the application and the controllers contain mainly code and little state data (i.e. tiny memory overhead). This makes for much less memory-intensive apps than solutions where view-models have to be retained and it is ideal for certain types of mobile development (e.g. Windows Mobile using Silverlight/Prism/MEF). This does of course depend on the type of application as you may still need to retain the occasional cached VMs for responsiveness. Note: This post has been edited numerous times, and did not specifically target the narrow question asked, so I have updated the first part to now cover that too. Much of the discussion, in comments below, relates only to ASP.Net and not the broader picture. This post was intended to cover the broader use of MVVM in Silverlight, WPF and ASP.Net and try avoid people replacing controllers with ViewModels.","MVC and MVVM are not mutually exclusive patterns.

3642919,3642969,javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException: View could not be restored,"Introduction The <code>ViewExpiredException</code> will be thrown whenever the <code>javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD</code> is set to <code>server</code> (default) and the enduser sends a HTTP POST request on a view via <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;h:commandLink&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h:commandButton&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;f:ajax&gt;</code>, while the associated view state isn't available in the session anymore. The view state is identified as value of a hidden input field <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> of the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code>. With the state saving method set to <code>server</code>, this contains only the view state ID which references a serialized view state in the session. So, when the session is expired for some reason (either timed out in server or client side, or the session cookie is not maintained anymore for some reason in browser, or by calling <code>HttpSession#invalidate()</code> in server, or due a server specific bug with session cookies as known in WildFly), then the serialized view state is not available anymore in the session and the enduser will get this exception. To understand the working of the session, see also How do servlets work? Instantiation, sessions, shared variables and multithreading. There is also a limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session. When the limit is hit, then the least recently used view will be expired. See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. With the state saving method set to <code>client</code>, the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden input field contains instead the whole serialized view state, so the enduser won't get a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when the session expires. It can however still happen on a cluster environment (""ERROR: MAC did not verify"" is symptomatic) and/or when there's a implementation-specific timeout on the client side state configured and/or when server re-generates the AES key during restart, see also Getting ViewExpiredException in clustered environment while state saving method is set to client and user session is valid how to solve it. Regardless of the solution, make sure you do not use <code>enableRestoreView11Compatibility</code>. it does not at all restore the original view state. It basically recreates the view and all associated view scoped beans from scratch and hereby thus losing all of original data (state). As the application will behave in a confusing way (""Hey, where are my input values..?? ""), this is very bad for user experience. Better use stateless views or <code>&lt;o:enableRestorableView&gt;</code> instead so you can manage it on a specific view only instead of on all views. As to the why JSF needs to save view state, head to this answer: Why JSF saves the state of UI components on server? Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page navigation In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when e.g. navigating back after logout when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, only redirecting the POST request after logout is not sufficient. You also need to instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, otherwise the browser may show them from the cache instead of requesting a fresh one from the server when you send a GET request on it (e.g. by back button). The <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field of the cached page may contain a view state ID value which is not valid anymore in the current session. If you're (ab)using POST (command links/buttons) instead of GET (regular links/buttons) for page-to-page navigation, and click such a command link/button on the cached page, then this will in turn fail with a <code>ViewExpiredException</code>. To fire a redirect after logout in JSF 2.0, either add <code>&lt;redirect /&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;navigation-case&gt;</code> in question (if any), or add <code>?faces-redirect=true</code> to the <code>outcome</code> value. or To instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, create a <code>Filter</code> which is mapped on the servlet name of the <code>FacesServlet</code> and adds the needed response headers to disable the browser cache. E.g. Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page refresh In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when refreshing the current page when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, you not only need to make sure you are performing page-to-page navigation exclusively by GET (regular links/buttons), but you also need to make sure that you are exclusively using ajax to submit the forms. If you're submitting the form synchronously (non-ajax) anyway, then you'd best either make the view stateless (see later section), or to send a redirect after POST (see previous section). Having a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> on page refresh is in default configuration a very rare case. It can only happen when the limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session is hit. So, it will only happen when you've manually set that limit way too low, or that you're continuously creating new views in background (e.g. by a badly implemented poll). See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. Another cause is having duplicate JSF libraries in runtime classpath conflicting each other. The correct procedure to install JSF is outlined in our JSF wiki page. Handling ViewExpiredException When you want to handle an unavoidable <code>ViewExpiredException</code> after a POST action on an arbitrary page which was already opened in some browser tab/window while you're logged out in another tab/window, then you'd like to specify an <code>error-page</code> for that in <code>web.xml</code> which goes to a ""Your session is timed out"" page. E.g. Use if necessary a meta refresh header in the error page in case you intend to actually redirect further to home or login page. (the <code>0</code> in <code>content</code> represents the amount of seconds before redirect, <code>0</code> thus means ""redirect immediately"", you can use e.g. <code>3</code> to let the browser wait 3 seconds with the redirect) Note that handling exceptions during ajax requests requires a special <code>ExceptionHandler</code>. See also Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request. You can find a live example at OmniFaces <code>FullAjaxExceptionHandler</code> showcase page (this also covers non-ajax requests). Also note that your ""general"" error page should be mapped on <code>&lt;error-code&gt;</code> of <code>500</code> instead of an <code>&lt;exception-type&gt;</code> of e.g. <code>java.lang.Exception</code> or <code>java.lang.Throwable</code>, otherwise all exceptions wrapped in <code>ServletException</code> such as <code>ViewExpiredException</code> would still end up in the general error page. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml. Stateless views A completely different alternative is to run JSF views in stateless mode. This way nothing of JSF state will be saved and the views will never expire, but just be rebuilt from scratch on every request. You can turn on stateless views by setting the <code>transient</code> attribute of <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>: This way the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field will get a fixed value of <code>""stateless""</code> in Mojarra (have not checked MyFaces at this point). Note that this feature was introduced in Mojarra 2.1.19 and 2.2.0 and is not available in older versions. The consequence is that you cannot use view scoped beans anymore. They will now behave like request scoped beans. One of the disadvantages is that you have to track the state yourself by fiddling with hidden inputs and/or loose request parameters. Mainly those forms with input fields with <code>rendered</code>, <code>readonly</code> or <code>disabled</code> attributes which are controlled by ajax events will be affected. Note that the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> does not necessarily need to be unique throughout the view and/or reside in the master template only. It's also completely legit to redeclare and nest it in a template client. It basically ""extends"" the parent <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> then. E.g. in master template: and in template client: You can even wrap the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;c:if&gt;</code> to make it conditional. Note that it would apply on the entire view, not only on the nested contents, such as the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> in above example. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml Check if session exists JSF Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request Unrelated to the concrete problem, using HTTP POST for pure page-to-page navigation isn't very user/SEO friendly. In JSF 2.0 you should really prefer <code>&lt;h:link&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h:button&gt;</code> over the <code>&lt;h:commandXxx&gt;</code> ones for plain vanilla page-to-page navigation.

890128,3961969,Why are Python lambdas useful?,"As stated above, the lambda operator in Python defines an anonymous function, and in Python functions are closures. It is important not to confuse the concept of closures with the operator lambda, which is merely syntactic methadone for them. When I started in Python a few years ago, I used lambdas a lot, thinking they were cool, along with list comprehensions. However, I wrote and have to maintain a big website written in Python, with on the order of several thousand function points. I've learnt from experience that lambdas might be OK to prototype things with, but offer nothing over inline functions (named closures) except for saving a few key-stokes, or sometimes not. Basically this boils down to several points: it is easier to read software that is explicitly written using meaningful names. Anonymous closures by definition cannot have a meaningful name, as they have no name. This brevity seems, for some reason, to also infect lambda parameters, hence we often see examples like lambda x: x+1 it is easier to reuse named closures, as they can be referred to by name more than once, when there is a name to refer to them by. it is easier to debug code that is using named closures instead of lambdas, because the name will appear in tracebacks, and around the error. That's enough reason to round them up and convert them to named closures. However, I hold two other grudges against anonymous closures. The first grudge is simply that they are just another unnecessary keyword cluttering up the language. The second grudge is deeper and on the paradigm level, i.e. I do not like that they promote a functional-programming style, because that style is less flexible than the message passing, object oriented or procedural styles, because the lambda calculus is not Turing-complete (luckily in Python, we can still break out of that restriction even inside a lambda). The reasons I feel lambdas promote this style are: There is an implicit return, i.e. they seem like they 'should' be functions. They are an alternative state-hiding mechanism to another, more explicit, more readable, more reusable and more general mechanism: methods. I try hard to write lambda-free Python, and remove lambdas on sight. I think Python would be a slightly better language without lambdas, but that's just my opinion.","Python lambdas are not as useful as they seem, as they offer no significant benefits over inline functions (named closures) except for brevity. They can make code harder to read, debug, and maintain due to their anonymous nature, and promote a less flexible functional programming style.","As stated above, the lambda operator in Python defines an anonymous function, and in Python functions are closures.

Even if you put code inside the main function, you are not required to write it exactly as that. A neat variation could be: This means you can call <code>main()</code> from other scripts (or interactive shell) passing custom parameters. This might be useful in unit tests, or when batch-processing. But remember that the code above will require parsing of argv, thus maybe it would be better to use a different call that pass parameters already parsed. In an object-oriented application I've written, the code looked like this: So, feel free to write the code that better suits you. :)","Reasons to use `def main()` in Python:

4062001,4062032,CSS3 Border Opacity?,"Unfortunately the <code>opacity</code> element makes the whole element (including any text) semi-transparent. The best way to make the border semi-transparent is with the rgba color format. For example, this would give a red border with 50% opacity: The problem with this approach is that some browsers do not understand the <code>rgba</code> format and will not display any border at all if this is the entire declaration. The solution is to provide two border declarations. The first with a fake opacity, and the second with the actual. If a browser is capable, it will use the second, if not, it will use the first. The first border declaration will be the equivalent color to a 50% opaque red border over a white background (although any graphics under the border will not bleed through). UPDATE: I've added ""background-clip: padding-box;"" to this answer (per  SooDesuNe's suggestion in the comments) to ensure the border remains transparent even if a solid background color is applied.",,,The best way to make the border semi-transparent is with the rgba color format.

It was baffling! Turns out, I let a variable go out of scope and the garbage collector swept it away and then I tried to use it. Thus the seemingly-random timing. To give a more concrete example... Inside a method, I had something like: Now in my JSP page, I called that method and used the List object returned by it. The List object is backed by that ""foos"" array; but, the array went out of scope when I returned from the method (since it is a local variable). So shortly after returning, the garbage collector swept away the ""foos"" array, and my access to the List caused a NullPointerException since its underlying array was now wiped away. I actually wondered, as I wrote the above method, whether that would happen. The even deeper underlying problem was premature optimization. I wanted a list, but I knew I would have exactly 20 elements, so I figured I'd try to be more efficient than <code>new ArrayList&lt;Foo&gt;(20)</code> which only sets an initial size of 20 but can possibly be less efficient than the method I used. So of course, to fix it, I just created my ArrayList, filled it up, and returned it.

529085,4221845,How to create a generic array in Java?,"Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): That compiles without warnings, and as you can see in <code>main</code>, for whatever type you declare an instance of <code>GenSet</code> as, you can assign <code>a</code> to an array of that type, and you can assign an element from <code>a</code> to a variable of that type, meaning that the array and the values in the array are of the correct type. It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials. Class literals are treated by the compiler as instances of <code>java.lang.Class</code>. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with <code>.class</code>. So, <code>String.class</code> acts as a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>. This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. <code>String[].class</code>), primitives (e.g. <code>int.class</code>), and the keyword <code>void</code> (i.e. <code>void.class</code>). <code>Class</code> itself is generic (declared as <code>Class&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> stands for the type that the <code>Class</code> object is representing), meaning that the type of <code>String.class</code> is <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>. So, whenever you call the constructor for <code>GenSet</code>, you pass in a class literal for the first argument representing an array of the <code>GenSet</code> instance's declared type (e.g. <code>String[].class</code> for <code>GenSet&lt;String&gt;</code>). Note that you won't be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can't be used for type variables. Inside the constructor, calling the method <code>cast</code> returns the passed <code>Object</code> argument cast to the class represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called. Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument. Calling the method <code>getComponentType</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the component type of the array represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called (e.g. <code>String.class</code> for <code>String[].class</code>, <code>null</code> if the <code>Class</code> object doesn't represent an array). That last sentence isn't entirely accurate. Calling <code>String[].class.getComponentType()</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>, but its type is <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, not <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>, which is why you can't do something like the following. Same goes for every method in <code>Class</code> that returns a <code>Class</code> object. Regarding Joachim Sauer's comment on this answer (I don't have enough reputation to comment on it myself), the example using the cast to <code>T[]</code> will result in a warning because the compiler can't guarantee type safety in that case. Edit regarding Ingo's comments:","A generic array in Java can be created using class literals as runtime type tokens, which are instances of `java.lang.Class`. To create a generic array, use the `GenSet` class with the class literal of the desired array type as the first argument, like `GenSet<String[].class>`. The `GenSet` class uses `java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance` to create the array and `Class.getComponentType` to get the component type of the array.","Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): So, <code>String.class</code> acts as a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>.

(The link should provide more insight with how it works - look at the pairs of methods generated, and a tutorial should show you how to use it.) The trick is that <code>class</code> is not a definition in Ruby (it is ""just a definition"" in languages like C++ and Java), but it is an expression that evaluates. It is during this evaluation when the <code>attr_accessor</code> method is invoked which in turn modifies the current class - remember the implicit receiver: <code>self.attr_accessor</code>, where <code>self</code> is the ""open"" class object at this point. The need for <code>attr_accessor</code> and friends, is, well: Ruby, like Smalltalk, does not allow instance variables to be accessed outside of methods1 for that object. That is, instance variables cannot be accessed in the <code>x.y</code> form as is common in say, Java or even Python. In Ruby <code>y</code> is always taken as a message to send (or ""method to call""). Thus the <code>attr_*</code> methods create wrappers which proxy the instance <code>@variable</code> access through dynamically created methods.

","Android has four units for measuring screen size: pixels (px), inches (in), millimeters (mm), and points (pt). Additionally, there are density-independent pixels (dp) and scale-independent pixels (sp). The key differences are:

- **px**: actual screen pixels, varying per screen.
- **in** and **mm**: based on physical screen size, same on every screen.
- **pt**: 1/72 of an inch, based on physical screen size.
- **dp**: density-independent pixels, relative to a 160 dpi screen, adjusting with screen density.
- **sp**: scale-independent pixels, like dp, but also scaled by user's font size preference.","<strong>px</strong>

417142,417184,What is the maximum length of a URL in different browsers?,"<h2>Short answer - de facto limit of 2000 characters</h2>
<p>If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software, and any search engine.</p>
<p>For specific use cases, longer URLs can be considered. Outside of search engines, 8000 characters offers wide compatibility as of 2023. Read on for all the details...</p>
<h2>Longer answer - first, the standards...</h2>
<p>The original HTTP/1.1 specification, published in 1999, <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 2616</a>, said in section 3.2.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP protocol does not place
any a priori limit on the length of
a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
the URI of any resource they    serve,
and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
unbounded length if they    provide
GET-based forms that could generate
such URIs. A server    SHOULD return
414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
URI is longer    than the server can
handle (see section 10.4.15).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, this was obsoleted by an updated specification largely to match actual usage, <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.1.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 7230</a>; it suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in
practice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients
support, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2022, a new update was published, defining HTTP semantics independently of HTTP version (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3). <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.1-5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 9110, section 4.1</a>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that all senders and recipients support, at a minimum, URIs with lengths of 8000 octets in protocol elements. Note that this implies some structures and on-wire representations (for example, the request line in HTTP/1.1) will necessarily be larger in some cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>...and the reality</h2>
<p>That's what the <em>standards</em> say. For the <em>reality</em>, there was an article on <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190902193246/https://boutell.com/newfaq/misc/urllength.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">boutell.com</a> (link goes to Internet Archive backup) that discussed what individual browser and server implementations will support. The executive summary is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: this is a quote from an article written in <em>2006</em>, but in 2015 IE's declining usage means that longer URLs <em>do</em> work for the majority. However, IE still has the limitation...)</p>
<h2>Internet Explorer's limitations...</h2>
<p><a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/208427"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IE8's maximum URL length is 2083 chars</a>, and it seems <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3721034/how-long-an-url-can-internet-explorer-9-take"">IE9 has a similar limit</a>.</p>
<p>I've tested IE10 and the address bar will only accept 2083 chars. You can <em>click</em> a URL which is longer than this, but the address bar will still only show 2083 characters of this link.</p>
<p>There's a <a href=""https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2014/08/13/url-length-limits/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nice writeup on the IE Internals blog</a> which goes into some of the background to this.</p>
<p>There are mixed reports IE11 supports longer URLs - see comments below. Given some people report issues, the general advice still stands.</p>
<h2>Search engines like URLs &lt; 2048 chars...</h2>
<p>Be aware that the <a href=""http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sitemaps protocol</a>, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. If you intend to use sitemaps, a limit has been decided for you! (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/7056886/6521"">Calin-Andrei Burloiu's answer</a> below)</p>

However, they also found the Google <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SERP</a> tool wouldn't cope with URLs longer than 1855 chars.</p>
<h2>CDNs have limits</h2>
<p>CDNs also impose limits on URI length, and will return a <code>414 Too long request</code> when these limits are reached, for example:</p>

<p>This is a popular question, and as the original research is ~14 years old I'll try to keep it up to date: As of <strong>Sep 2023</strong>, the advice still stands. While modern browsers will support longer URLs, search engines do not so the headline figure remains &quot;under 2000 chars&quot;</p>
",ERROR: Prompt length of 2657 is longer than the maximum model length of 2048.,"Servers MUST be able to handle
the URI of any resource they    serve,
and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
unbounded length if they    provide
GET-based forms that could generate
such URIs. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users. If you intend to use sitemaps, a limit has been decided for you!","Short answer - de facto limit of 2000 characters
If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software, and any search engine. For specific use cases, longer URLs can be considered. Read on for all the details...
Longer answer - first, the standards... The executive summary is:

Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users. Search engines like URLs &lt; 2048 chars...
Be aware that the sitemaps protocol, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. While modern browsers will support longer URLs, search engines do not so the headline figure remains ""under 2000 chars"""

292357,15733096,What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?,"<p>It is important to contrast the design philosophy of git with the philosophy of a more traditional source control tool like SVN.</p>

<p>Subversion was designed and built with a client/server model. There is a single repository that is the server, and several clients can fetch code from the server, work on it, then commit it back to the server. The assumption is that the client can always contact the server when it needs to perform an operation.</p>

<p>Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the ""server"" don't need to be online at the same time. Git was designed so that people on an unreliable link could exchange code via email, even. It is possible to work completely disconnected and burn a CD to exchange code via git.</p>

<p>In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. By keeping a copy of the remote repository locally, git can figure out the changes needed even when the remote repository is not reachable.  Later when you need to send the changes to someone else, git can transfer them as a set of changes from a point in time known to the remote repository.</p>

<p>Normally <strong><code>git pull</code></strong> does this by doing a <strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.</p>

<p>The take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least <strong>three copies</strong> of a project on your workstation. One copy is your own repository with your own commit history. The second copy is your working copy where you are editing and building. The third copy is your local ""cached"" copy of a remote repository.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Screen size</strong><br/>
Actual physical size, measured as the screen's diagonal.
For simplicity, Android groups all actual screen sizes into four
generalized sizes: small, normal, large, and extra-large.</p>
<p><strong>Screen density</strong><br/>
The number of pixels within a physical area of the
screen; usually referred to as dpi (dots per inch). For example, a
&quot;low&quot; density screen has fewer pixels within a given physical area,
compared to a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;high&quot; density screen. For simplicity,
Android groups all actual screen densities into six generalized
densities: low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high, and
extra-extra-extra-high.</p>
<p><strong>Orientation</strong><br/>The orientation of the screen from the user's point of
view. This is either landscape or portrait, meaning that the screen's
aspect ratio is either wide or tall, respectively. Be aware that not
only do different devices operate in different orientations by
default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user
rotates the device.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong><br/> The total number of physical pixels on
a screen. When adding support for multiple screens, applications do
not work directly with resolution; applications should be concerned
only with screen size and density, as specified by the generalized
size and density groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Density-independent pixel (dp)</strong><br/> A virtual
pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express
layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way.
The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160
dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a
&quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles
any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density
of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:
<code>px = dp * (dpi / 160)</code>.
For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp
equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when
defining your application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on
screens with different densities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are at all serious about developing an Android app for more than one type of device, you should have read the screens support development document at least once. In addition to that, it is always a good thing to know the actual number of active devices that have a particular screen configuration.</p>

So, <code>git pull -rebase</code> will pull down the remote changes, rewind your local branch, replay your changes over the top of your current branch one by one until you're up-to-date.</p>
<p>Also, <code>git branch -a</code> will show you exactly what’s going on with all your branches - local and remote.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode"" rel=""noreferrer"">JavaScript strict mode</a> is a feature in <a href=""https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ECMAScript 5</a>. You can enable the strict mode by declaring this in the top of your script/function.</p>
<pre><code>'use strict';
</code></pre>
<p>When a JavaScript engine sees this <em>directive</em>, it will start to interpret the code in a special mode. In this mode, errors are thrown up when certain coding practices that could end up being potential bugs are detected (which is the reasoning behind the strict mode).</p>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<pre><code>var a = 365;
var b = 030;
</code></pre>
<p>In their obsession to line up the numeric literals, the developer has inadvertently initialized variable <code>b</code> with an octal literal. Non-strict mode will interpret this as a numeric literal with value <code>24</code> (in base 10). However, strict mode will throw an error.</p>

<h2>Where should I use <code>'use strict';</code>?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In my <em>new</em> JavaScript application: <strong>Absolutely!</strong> Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In my <em>existing</em> JavaScript code: <strong>Probably not!</strong> If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break. If you want strict mode, you should be prepared to debug and correct your existing code. This is why <em>using <code>'use strict';</code> does not suddenly make your code better</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>How do I use strict mode?</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Insert a <code>'use strict';</code> statement on top of your script:</p>
<pre><code> // File: myscript.js

 'use strict';
 var a = 2;
 ....
</code></pre>
<p>Note that everything in the file <code>myscript.js</code> will be interpreted in strict mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Or, insert a <code>'use strict';</code> statement on top of your function body:</p>
<pre><code> function doSomething() {
     'use strict';
     ...
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Everything in the <em>lexical scope</em> of function <code>doSomething</code> will be interpreted in strict mode. The word <em>lexical scope</em> is important here. For example, if your <em>strict</em> code calls a function of a library that is <em>not strict</em>, only your code is executed in strict mode, and not the called function.

<h2>What things are prohibited in strict mode?</h2>
<p>I found a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20200704094929/http://yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/"" rel=""noreferrer"">nice article</a> describing several things that are prohibited in strict mode (note that this is not an exhaustive list):</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Historically, JavaScript has been confused about how functions
are scoped. Sometimes they seem to be statically scoped, but some
features make them behave like they are dynamically scoped. This is
confusing, making programs difficult to read and understand.
Misunderstanding causes bugs. It also is a problem for performance.
Static scoping would permit variable binding to happen at compile
time, but the requirement for dynamic scope means the binding must be
deferred to runtime, which comes with a significant performance
penalty.</p>
<p>Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically.
That means that the features that previously required dynamic binding
must be eliminated or modified. Specifically, the with statement is
eliminated, and the eval function’s ability to tamper with the
environment of its caller is severely restricted.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of strict code is that tools like <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/"" rel=""noreferrer"">YUI Compressor</a>
can do a better job when processing it.</p>
<h2>Implied Global Variables</h2>
<p>JavaScript has implied global variables. If
you do not explicitly declare a variable, a global variable is
implicitly declared for you. This makes programming easier for
beginners because they can neglect some of their basic housekeeping
chores. But it makes the management of larger programs much more
difficult and it significantly degrades reliability. So in strict
mode, implied global variables are no longer created. You should
explicitly declare all of your variables.</p>
<h2>Global Leakage</h2>
<p>There are a number of situations that could cause <code>this</code>
to be bound to the global object. For example, if you forget to
provide the <code>new</code> prefix when calling a constructor function, the
constructor's <code>this</code> will be bound unexpectedly to the global object, so
instead of initializing a new object, it will instead be silently
tampering with global variables. In these situations, strict mode will
instead bind <code>this</code> to <code>undefined</code>, which will cause the constructor to
throw an exception instead, allowing the error to be detected much
sooner.</p>
<h2>Noisy Failure</h2>
<p>JavaScript has always had read-only properties, but you
could not create them yourself until ES5’s <code>Object.createProperty</code>
function exposed that capability. If you attempted to assign a value
to a read-only property, it would fail silently. The assignment would
not change the property’s value, but your program would proceed as
though it had. This is an integrity hazard that can cause programs to
go into an inconsistent state. In strict mode, attempting to change a
read-only property will throw an exception.</p>
<h2>Octal</h2>
<p>The octal (or base 8) representation of numbers was extremely
useful when doing machine-level programming on machines whose word
sizes were a multiple of 3. You needed octal when working with the CDC
6600 mainframe, which had a word size of 60 bits. If you could read
octal, you could look at a word as 20 digits. Two digits represented
the op code, and one digit identified one of 8 registers. During the
slow transition from machine codes to high level languages, it was
thought to be useful to provide octal forms in programming languages.</p>
<p>In C, an extremely unfortunate representation of octalness was
selected: Leading zero. So in C, <code>0100</code> means 64, not 100, and <code>08</code> is an
error, not 8. Even more unfortunately, this anachronism has been
copied into nearly all modern languages, including JavaScript, where
it is only used to create errors. It has no other purpose. So in
strict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed.</p>
<h2>Et cetera</h2>
<p>The arguments pseudo array becomes a little bit more
array-like in ES5. In strict mode, it loses its <code>callee</code> and <code>caller</code>
properties. This makes it possible to pass your <code>arguments</code> to untrusted
code without giving up a lot of confidential context. Also, the
<code>arguments</code> property of functions is eliminated.</p>
<p>In strict mode, duplicate keys in a function literal will produce a
syntax error. A function can’t have two parameters with the same name.
A function can’t have a variable with the same name as one of its
parameters. A function can’t <code>delete</code> its own variables. An attempt to
<code>delete</code> a non-configurable property now throws an exception. Primitive
values are not implicitly wrapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Reserved words for future JavaScript versions</h2>
<p>ECMAScript 5 adds a list of reserved words. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error. The reserved words are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>implements</code>, <code>interface</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>package</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>yield</code></p>

At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp
units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use.
The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi

git-pull - Fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch
SYNOPSIS

git pull   …
DESCRIPTION

Runs git-fetch with the given parameters, and calls git-merge to merge the 
retrieved head(s) into the current branch. With --rebase, calls git-rebase 
instead of git-merge.

Note that you can use . (current directory) as the &lt;repository> to pull 
from the local repository — this is useful when merging local branches 
into the current branch.

Also note that options meant for git-pull itself and underlying git-merge 
must be given before the options meant for git-fetch.
</pre>

<p>You would pull if you want the histories merged, you'd fetch if you just 'want the codez' as some person has been tagging some articles around here.</p>
","`git pull` fetches and merges changes from another repository or local branch, while `git fetch` only retrieves changes without merging them. 

`git pull` can be used with `--rebase` to use `git-rebase` instead of `git-merge`.","You would pull if you want the histories merged, you'd fetch if you just 'want the codez' as some person has been tagging some articles around here.","You would pull if you want the histories merged, you'd fetch if you just 'want the codez' as some person has been tagging some articles around here."

<p>By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is
also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that
you are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using
the --tags or --no-tags options or by configuring
remote..tagOpt. By using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly,
you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested
in as well.</p>
<p>git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository or URL or
from several repositories at once if  is given and there is a

<p>These are dimension values defined in XML. A dimension is specified
with a number followed by a unit of measure. For example: 10px, 2in,
5sp. The following units of measure are supported by Android:</p>
<p><strong>dp</strong></p>
<p>Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the
physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a 160 dpi
(dots per inch) screen, on which 1dp is roughly equal to 1px. When
running on a higher density screen, the number of pixels used to draw
1dp is scaled up by a factor appropriate for the screen's dpi.
Likewise, when on a lower density screen, the number of pixels used
for 1dp is scaled down. The ratio of dp-to-pixel will change with the
screen density, but not necessarily in direct proportion. Using dp
units (instead of px units) is a simple solution to making the view
dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen
densities. In other words, it provides consistency for the real-world
sizes of your UI elements across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>sp</strong></p>
<p>Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended that you use
this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for
both the screen density and the user's preference.</p>
<p><strong>pt</strong></p>
<p>Points - 1/72 of an inch based on the physical size of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>px</strong></p>
<p>Pixels - Corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. This unit of
measure is not recommended because the actual representation can vary
across devices; each device may have a different number of pixels per
inch and may have more or fewer total pixels available on the screen.</p>

<em>(Keeping in mind that pictures speak louder than words!, I have provided pictorial representation)</em></p>
<p>Let's take an example that you are working on a project with your team members. So there will be one main Branch of the project and all the contributors must fork it to their own local repository and then work on this local branch to modify/Add modules then push back to the main branch.</p>
<p>So,
<strong>Initial State</strong> of the two Branches when you forked the main project on your local repository will be like this- (<code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are Modules already completed of the project)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/SPky3.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SPky3.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you have started working on the new module (suppose <code>D</code>)  and when you have completed the <code>D</code> module you want to push it to the main branch, But meanwhile what happens is that one of your teammates has developed new Module <code>E</code>, <code>F</code> and modified <code>C</code>.<br>
So now what has happened is that your local repository is lacking behind the original progress of the project and thus pushing of your changes to the main branch can lead to conflict and may cause your Module <code>D</code> to malfunction.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/SpIlX.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SpIlX.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>To avoid such issues and to work parallel with the original progress of the project there are Two ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Git Fetch-</strong> This will Download all the changes that have been made to the origin/main branch project which are not present in your local branch. And will wait for the Git Merge command to apply the changes that have been fetched to your Repository or branch.</p>

<p>On the plane, you could make changes to your local workspace and then merge it with what you've previously fetched and then resolve potential merge conflicts all without a connection to the Internet. And unless someone had made <em>new</em> changes to the remote repository then, upon arrive at the destination you would do <code>git push origin &lt;branch&gt;</code> and go get your coffee.</p>
<hr />
<p>From this awesome <a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-fetch"" rel=""noreferrer"">Atlassian tutorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>git fetch</code> command downloads commits, files, and refs from a
remote repository into your local repository.</p>
<p>Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody <em>else</em> has
been working on. It’s similar to SVN update in that it lets you see
how the central history has progressed, but it doesn’t force you to
actually merge the changes into your repository. Git <strong>isolates
fetched content as a from existing local content</strong>, it has absolutely
<strong>no effect on your local development work</strong>. Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the <code>git checkout</code> command. This makes
fetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with
your local repository.</p>
<p>When downloading content from a remote repository, <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code> commands are available to accomplish the task. You can consider
<code>git fetch</code> the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download
the remote content, but not update your local repository's working state,
leaving your current work intact. <code>git pull</code> is the more aggressive
alternative, it will download the remote content for the active local
branch and immediately execute <code>git merge</code> to create a merge commit
for the new remote content. If you have pending changes in progress
this will cause conflicts and kickoff the merge conflict resolution
flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>With <code>git pull</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't get any isolation.</li>
<li>It doesn't need to be explicitly checked out. Because it implicitly does a <code>git merge</code>.</li>
<li>The merging step will affect your local development and <em>may</em> cause conflicts</li>
<li>It's basically NOT safe. It's aggressive.</li>
<li>Unlike <code>git fetch</code> where it only affects your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code>, git pull will affect both your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>.git/refs/heads/</code></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Hmmm...so if I'm not updating the working copy with <code>git fetch</code>, then where am I making changes? Where does Git fetch store the new commits?</strong></p>
<p>Great question. First and foremost, the <code>heads</code> or <code>remotes</code> don't store the new commits. They just have <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3965676/why-did-my-git-repo-enter-a-detached-head-state/65847406#65847406"">pointers</a> to commits.

To fully understand the objects watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG90LZotrpo"" rel=""noreferrer"">this video on git internals</a>), but only update your <code>remotes</code> pointer to point to the latest commit of that branch.  It's still isolated from your working copy, because your branch's pointer in the <code>heads</code> directory hasn't updated. It will only update upon a <code>merge</code>/<code>pull</code>. But again where? Let's find out.</p>
<p>In your project directory (i.e., where you do your <code>git</code> commands) do:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>ls</code>. This will show the files &amp; directories. Nothing cool, I know.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now do <code>ls -a</code>. This will show <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/21778/whats-so-special-about-directories-whose-names-begin-with-a-dot"">dot files</a>, i.e., files beginning with <code>.</code> You will then be able to see a directory named: <code>.git</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do <code>cd .git</code>. This will obviously change your directory.</p>
</li>

</li>

<h2>To see the actual difference</h2>
<p>Just do:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin master
git checkout master
</code></pre>
<p>If the remote master was updated you'll get a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to update your local branch)
</code></pre>
<p>If you didn't <code>fetch</code> and just did <code>git checkout master</code> then your local git wouldn't know that there are 2 commits added. And it would just say:</p>
<pre><code>Already on 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
</code></pre>
<p>But that's outdated and incorrect. It's because git will give you feedback solely based on what it knows. It's oblivious to new commits that it hasn't pulled down yet...</p>
<hr />
<h2>Is there any way to see the new changes made in remote while working on the branch locally?</h2>
<p>Some IDEs (e.g. Xcode) are super smart and use the result of a <code>git fetch</code> and can annotate the lines of code that have been changed in remote branch of your current working branch. If that line has been changed by both local changes and remote branch, then that line gets annotated with red. This isn't a merge conflict. It's a <em>potential</em> merge conflict. It's a headsup that you can use to resolve the future merge conflict before doing <code>git pull</code> from the remote branch.</p>

<p>If you fetched a remote branch e.g. did:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin feature/123

<p>You can refer to the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p><code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code> a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5.</p>
<p>Directives are similar to statements, yet different.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>use strict</code> does not contain key words: The directive is a simple expression statement, which consists of a special string literal (in single or double quotes). JavaScript engines, that do not implement ECMAScript 5, merely see an expression statement without side effects. It is expected that future versions of ECMAScript standards introduce <code>use</code> as a real key word; the quotes would thereby become obsolete.</li>
<li><code>use strict</code> can be used only at the beginning of a script or of a function, i.e. it must precede every other (real) statement. It does not have to be the first instruction in a script of function: it can be preceded by other statement expressions that consist of string literals ( and JavaScript implementations can treat them as implementation specific directives). String literals statements, which follow a first real statement (in a script or function) are simple expression statements. Interpreters must not interpret them as directives and they have no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>use strict</code> directive indicates that the following code (in a script or a function) is strict code.
The code in the highest level of a script (code that is not in a function) is considered strict code when the script contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
The content of a function is considered strict code when the function itself is defined in a strict code or when the function contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
Code that is passed to an <code>eval()</code> method is considered strict code when <code>eval()</code> was called from a strict code or contains the <code>use strict</code> directive itself.</p>
<p>The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important):</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode.</li>
<li>In strict mode all variables have to be declared: if you assign a value to an identifier that has not been declared as variable, function, function parameter, catch-clause parameter or property of the global <code>Object</code>, then you will get a <code>ReferenceError</code>. In normal mode the identifier is implicitly declared as a global variable (as a property of the global <code>Object</code>)</li>
<li>In strict mode the keyword <code>this</code> has the value <code>undefined</code> in functions that were invoked as functions (not as methods). (In normal mode <code>this</code> always points to the global <code>Object</code>). This difference can be used to test if an implementation supports the strict mode:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>var hasStrictMode = (function() { &quot;use strict&quot;; return this===undefined }());
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Also when a function is invoked with <code>call()</code> or <code>apply</code> in strict mode, then <code>this</code> is exactly the value of the first argument of the <code>call()</code>or <code>apply()</code> invocation. (In normal mode <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are replaced by the global <code>Object</code> and values, which are not objects, are cast into objects.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>TypeError</code>, when you try to assign to readonly properties or to define new properties for a non extensible object. (In normal mode both simply fail without error message.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode, when passing code to <code>eval()</code>, you cannot declare or define variables or functions in the scope of the caller (as you can do it in normal mode). Instead, a new scope is created for <code>eval()</code> and the variables and functions are within that scope. That scope is destroyed after <code>eval()</code> finishes execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode the arguments-object of a function contains a static copy of the values, which are passed to that function. In normal mode the arguments-object has a somewhat &quot;magical&quot; behaviour: The elements of the array and the named function parameters reference both the same value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>SyntaxError</code> when the <code>delete</code> operator is followed by a non qualified identifier (a variable, function or function parameter). In normal mode the <code>delete</code> expression would do nothing and is evaluated to <code>false</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>TypeError</code> when you try to delete a non configurable property. (In normal mode the attempt simply fails and the <code>delete</code> expression is evaluated to <code>false</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when you try to define several properties with the same name for an object literal. (In normal mode there is no error.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when a function declaration has multiple parameters with the same name. (In normal mode there is no error.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode octal literals are not allowed (these are literals that start with <code>0</code>. (In normal mode some implementations do allow octal literals.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode the identifiers <code>eval</code> and <code>arguments</code> are treated like keywords. You cannot change their value, cannot assign a value to them, and you cannot use them as names for variables, functions, function parameters or identifiers of a catch block.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode are more restrictions on the possibilities to examine the call stack. <code>arguments.caller</code> and <code>arguments.callee</code> cause a <code>TypeError</code> in a function in strict mode. Furthermore, some caller- and arguments properties of functions in strict mode cause a <code>TypeError</code> when you try to read them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
","""use strict"" is a directive in ECMAScript 5 that enables strict mode in JavaScript. It's a simple expression statement that can only be used at the beginning of a script or a function. Strict mode eliminates language deficits, enhances error checking, and improves security by enforcing the following rules:

- Variables must be declared before use.
- The ""with"" statement is disallowed.
- ""this"" has a value of undefined in functions, unless explicitly set.
- Assigning to read-only properties or defining new properties for non-extensible objects results in a TypeError.
- eval() creates a new scope, and variables declared in it are local to that scope.
- The arguments object contains a static copy of passed values.
- Deleting non-qualified identifiers results in a SyntaxError.
- Deleting non-configurable properties results in a TypeError.
- Duplicate property names","<code>""use strict""</code> a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5.

2025282,24646157,"What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?","<h2>Where to use what &amp; relationship between px &amp; dp?</h2>
<h3>Density-independent pixel (dp)</h3>
<p>A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. As described above, the density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a &quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:</p>
<p>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</p>
<p>For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure
proper display of your UI on screens with different densities.</p>
<p>Understanding pixel to dp and vice versa is very essential (especially for giving exact dp values to creative team)</p>
<pre><code>dp = px * 160 / dpi

MDPI = 160 dpi || Therefore, on MDPI 1 px = 1 dp
For example, if you want to convert 20 pixel to dp, use the above formula,
dp = 20 * 160 / 160 = 20.
So, 20 pixel = 20 dp.

HDPI = 240 dpi - So, on HDPI 1.5 px = 1 dp
XHDPI = 320 dpi - So, on XHDPI 2 px = 1 dp
XXHDPI = 480 dpi - So, on XXHDPI 3 px = 1 dp

For example, let us consider Nexus 4.
If 24 pixels to be converted to dp and if it is a Nexus 4 screen, developers can
convert it to dp easily by the following calculation :
dp = 24 * 160 / 320 = 12 dp
Screen dimension:
768 x 1280 pixel resolution (320 ppi or 320dpi)
Optional (screen size):
 4.7&quot; diagonal

<ul>
<li>Try to get all pixel values in even numbers from the creative team. Otherwise precision lose will happen while multiplying with 0.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>px</h3>
<p>It is explained above. Try to avoid in layout files. But there are some cases, where px is required. for example, ListView divider line. px is better here for giving a one-pixel line as a divider for all across screen resolutions.</p>
<h3>sp</h3>
<p>Use sp for font sizes. Then only the font inside the application will change while device fonts size changes (that is, Display -&gt; Fonts on Device). If you want to keep a static sized font inside the app, you can give the font dimension in dp. In such a case, it will never change. Developers may get such a requirement for some specific screens, for that, developers can use dp instead of sp. In all other cases, sp is recommended.</p>

But <strong>sp for text size will break the layout if used carelessly</strong> in most of the devices.</p>
<p>sp take the text size of the device, whereas dp take that of device density standard( never change in a device)
Say 100sp text can occupy 80% of the screen or 100% of the screen depending on the font size set in the device</p>

<p>You can use sp for layout bounds also, it will work :)
<strong>No standard app use sp for whole text</strong></p>
<p>Use sp and dp for text size considering UX.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use sp for text in the toolbar( can use android dimens available for different screen sizes with dp)</li>
<li>Don't use sp for text in small bounded buttons, very smaller text, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people use huge FONT size in their phone for more readability, giving them small hardcoded sized text will be a UX issue. Put sp for text where necessary, but make sure it won't break the layout when the user changes his settings.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have a single app supporting all dimensions, adding xxxhdpi assets increases the app size a lot. But now xxxhdpi phones are common so we have to include xxxhdpi assets at least for icons in the sidebar, toolbar, and bottom bar. It's better to move to vector images to have a uniform and better quality images for all screen sizes.</p>
<p>Also, note that people use custom fonts on their phones. So lack of a font can cause problems regarding spacing and all. Say text size 12sp for a custom font may take some pixels extra than the default font.</p>

226910,892204,How to sanity check a date in Java,"<p>As shown by @Maglob, the basic approach is to test the conversion from string to date using <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">SimpleDateFormat.parse</a>. That will catch invalid day/month combinations like 2008-02-31.</p>

<p>However, in practice that is rarely enough since SimpleDateFormat.parse is exceedingly liberal. There are two behaviours you might be concerned with:</p>

<p><strong>Invalid characters in the date string</strong>
Surprisingly, 2008-02-2x will ""pass"" as a valid date with locale format = ""yyyy-MM-dd"" for example. Even when isLenient==false.</p>

<p><strong>Years: 2, 3 or 4 digits?</strong>
You may also want to enforce 4-digit years rather than allowing the default SimpleDateFormat behaviour (which will interpret ""12-02-31"" differently depending on whether your format was ""yyyy-MM-dd"" or ""yy-MM-dd"")</p>

<h2>A Strict Solution with the Standard Library</h2>

<p>So a complete string to date test could look like this: a combination of regex match, and then a forced date conversion. The trick with the regex is to make it locale-friendly.</p>

<pre><code>  Date parseDate(String maybeDate, String format, boolean lenient) {
    Date date = null;

    // test date string matches format structure using regex
    // - weed out illegal characters and enforce 4-digit year
    // - create the regex based on the local format string
    String reFormat = Pattern.compile(""d+|M+"").matcher(Matcher.quoteReplacement(format)).replaceAll(""\\\\d{1,2}"");
    reFormat = Pattern.compile(""y+"").matcher(reFormat).replaceAll(""\\\\d{4}"");
    if ( Pattern.compile(reFormat).matcher(maybeDate).matches() ) {

      // date string matches format structure, 
      // - now test it can be converted to a valid date
      SimpleDateFormat sdf = (SimpleDateFormat)DateFormat.getDateInstance();
      sdf.applyPattern(format);
      sdf.setLenient(lenient);
      try { date = sdf.parse(maybeDate); } catch (ParseException e) { }
    } 
    return date;
  } 

  // used like this:
  Date date = parseDate( ""21/5/2009"", ""d/M/yyyy"", false);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the regex assumes the format string contains only day, month, year, and separator characters. Aside from that, format can be in any locale format: ""d/MM/yy"", ""yyyy-MM-dd"", and so on. The format string for the current locale could be obtained like this:</p>

<pre><code>Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
SimpleDateFormat sdf = (SimpleDateFormat)DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.SHORT, locale );
String format = sdf.toPattern();
</code></pre>

<h2>Joda Time - Better Alternative?</h2>

<p>I've been hearing about <a href=""http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">joda time</a> recently and thought I'd compare. Two points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Seems better at being strict about invalid characters in the date string, unlike SimpleDateFormat</li>
<li>Can't see a way to enforce 4-digit years with it yet (but I guess you could create your own <a href=""http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/api-release/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">DateTimeFormatter</a> for this purpose)</li>
</ol>

<p>It's quite simple to use:</p>

<pre><code>import org.joda.time.format.*;
import org.joda.time.DateTime;

org.joda.time.DateTime parseDate(String maybeDate, String format) {
  org.joda.time.DateTime date = null;
  try {
    DateTimeFormatter fmt = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(format);
    date =  fmt.parseDateTime(maybeDate);
  } catch (Exception e) { }
  return date;
}
</code></pre>
","To validate a date in Java, use a combination of regex and date conversion. 

First, test the date string's format structure using a regex that enforces 4-digit years and filters out invalid characters. Then, attempt to convert the string to a date using `SimpleDateFormat` with `setLenient(false)`. If the conversion fails, the date is invalid.

```java
Date parseDate(String maybeDate, String format, boolean lenient) {
    // regex to test format structure and enforce 4-digit year
    // ...
    SimpleDateFormat sdf = (SimpleDateFormat) DateFormat.getDateInstance();
    sdf.applyPattern(format);
    sdf.setLenient(lenient);
    try { date = sdf.parse(maybeDate); } catch (ParseException e) { }
    return date;
}
```

Alternatively, use the Joda Time library, which is more strict about invalid characters, but does not currently support enforcing 4-digit years out of the box.

```java
org.joda.time.DateTime parseDate(String maybeDate, String format) {
  org.joda.time.DateTime date = null;
  try {
    DateTimeFormatter fmt = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(format);
    date =  fmt.parseDateTime(maybeDate);
  } catch (Exception e) { }

Yes, I know that it's somehow described in Google docs (and mentioned in the posts above), I read that but it was not good for me (yeah, I may be too stupid)). It remained unclear to me how to design layouts capable to handle different screen sizes. I hate the DP concept and so on when I need to implement a &quot;flexible&quot; UI layout for different screens. (Hey iOS developers - yes, you're right it's a Storyboard concept).</p>
<p>Android has not bad UI concept, but lacks iOS Storyboard features, unfortunately. Designing flexible UI in Android is not an easy thing (at the best).</p>
<p>Here goes the article that helped me to understand what to do in Android to make layouts for different screen sizes:</p>
<p><a href=""http://jmsliu.com/1718/decide-android-app-screen-size.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JMSTUDIO Blog:- Decide Android App Screen Size</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How to Design UI for Android Apps for Different Screen Size</strong></p>
<p>To design an app UI for different screen sizes, our initial design has to
meet a minimum required space for each screen size. Android defines a
minimum size (in dp) for each generalized screen type. Here is an
Android screen size guideline.
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/MPEMR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/MPEMR.jpg"" alt=""Minimum Screen Size for Android in dp"" /></a>
When we get the screen size in dp, it is not enough for us to design
the Android app UI. For each screen size, we need to prepare graphics
and bitmap images for each density. Here is an Android screen density
guideline.
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Px14F.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Px14F.jpg"" alt=""Android Density Guideline (dpi)"" /></a></p>
<p>For easy calculation, we can follow the 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between
the four generalized densities. If we create a 36×36 pixel picture for
ldpi device, the rest densities pictures size will be 48×48 for mdpi,
72×72 for hdpi, and 96×96 for xhdpi.</p>
<p><strong>How to Design Android Apps UI in Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Many designers have problems designing Android app UI in photoshop or another pixel
based graphic design tools because of the density-independent unit, dp.
Designers don’t know how to map dp to pixel. Google also doesn’t give
a clear Android UI design guide for them, though they give a basic
formula for dp and pixel translation.</p>
<p>As Android’s definition, 1pd equal to 1px under 160 dpi device (mdpi).
So we want to design an Android app for xlarge Android devices with
mdpi density, we can define our UI size in pixel as 960 pixels in width
and 720px in height; Follow the same mapping rule, we can get
following Android App screen size UI design guideline:</p>

This size unit scales with the screen size</a> (this also mentioned in an answer here, about <code>SDP</code> library)</p>

","Android has different screen size and density guidelines to ensure UI flexibility. The main units are:

Alternatively, use the SDP (scalable dp) library or ConstraintLayout for a more flexible UI design.","Here is an

<p>The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>java.time.DateTimeFormatter</code></a> class can be set to parse strings with any of three leniency modes defined in the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle</code></a> enum. We insert a line into the above code to try each of the modes.</p>

<pre><code>f = f.withResolverStyle ( ResolverStyle.LENIENT );

<ul>

<p>We can see that in <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html#LENIENT"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle.LENIENT</code></a> mode, the invalid date is moved forward an equivalent number of days.

The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html#STRICT"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle.STRICT</code></a> mode throws an exception complaining that there is no such date.</p>

<p>All three of these are reasonable depending on your business problem and policies. Sounds like in your case you want the strict mode to reject the invalid date rather than adjust it.</p>

<p>I use the slowAES.wsc from the other post you referenced, with 2 changes: I do not call getPaddedBlock() for the key in the EncryptString or DecryptString() methods. This really needs a PBKDF but let's not worry about that now. Here's what the modified EncryptString looks like: </p>

<pre><code>function EncryptString(plainText)
{
  // this is really wrong - need a PBBKDF to get the key, instead
  // of just using the passphrase
  var key = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(_passphrase);
  // var nkey = slowAES.getPaddedBlock(key, 0, _keysize, _mode);
  var bytesToEncrypt = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(plainText);

  var result = slowAES.encrypt(bytesToEncrypt, 
      _mode,
      key,
      _keysize,
      _iv);
  return result['cipher'];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This means you have to use a passPhrase that is <em>exactly</em> the length required by the keysize.  If you use AES256, then pass a 32-char string (32 * 8 = 256 bits).  Seems like you figured this out already. </p>

<p>The client of the WSC component is also Javascript (though it can be any COM language).  Here's what I used.</p>

<pre><code>function toHexString(a)
{
    var ret = '';
    for(var i = 0;i &lt; a.length;i++)
        ret += (a[i] &lt; 16 ? '0' : '') + a[i].toString(16) + ' ';
    return ret.toLowerCase();
}


//var plaintext = ""Hello. This is a test. of the emergency broadcasting system."";
var plaintext = ""watson?"";

try
{
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext: "" + plaintext);
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext.length: "" + plaintext.length);

    WScript.echo( ""instantiate "");
    var aes = new ActiveXObject(""Ionic.Com.SlowAES"");

    WScript.echo( ""keysize "");
    aes.KeySize = 256;

    WScript.echo( ""passphrase "");
    aes.PassPhrase= ""12345678901234567890123456789012"";  // 32 chars long

    WScript.echo( ""mode "");
    aes.Mode = ""CBC"";

    WScript.echo( ""encrypting... "");
    var result = aes.EncryptString(plaintext);

    WScript.echo( ""Cryptotext: "" + toHexString(result));

    WScript.echo( ""decrypting... "");
    var decrypted = aes.DecryptBytesToString(result);

    WScript.echo( ""decrypted: "" + decrypted);
}
catch(e)
{
    WScript.echo(""Exception: "" + e); 
    //     WScript.echo(e.Number + "": "" + e.Name);
    WScript.echo(e.Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I then run this code, the Javascript and C# produces the same cipher text for a plaintext of ""watson?"", using AES256, passphrase of 12345678901234567890123456789012, and an IV of 16 bytes of zero.  The ciphertext generated is: </p>

<pre><code>8B 68 A6 23 08 2A D8 A0 EB 99 17 8F 69 03 18 FF
</code></pre>

<p>It successfully decrypts in both cases. </p>

2025282,41919625,"What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?","<p>The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as <strong>pixels (px)</strong>. A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable.</p>

<p>Screen resolution is measured in terms of number of pixels on the screen. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important.</p>

<p><strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device.</p>

<p>A density independent pixel (dp or dip) is equal to one pixel at the baseline density or 160 dpi (dots per inch).</p>

<p>1 px/1dp = 160 dpi/160 dpi</p>

<p>2 px/1dp = 320 dpi(2x)/160 dpi</p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>dpi is dots per inch</p>

<p>So, at 320 dpi, 1 dp is equal to 2 px.</p>

<p>Formula</p>

<p>px/dp = dpi/160dpi</p>

<p>Dots per inch (dpi) is a measure of the sharpness (that is, the density of illuminated points) on a display screen. The dots per inch for a given picture resolution will differ based on the overall screen size since the same number of pixels are being spread out over a different space.</p>

<p>Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. Suppose in a case, a tablet and phone has the same pixel resolution 1280 by 800 pixels (160 dpi) and 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi) respectively.</p>

<p>Now because a tablet is at baseline density (160 dpi) its physical and density independent pixels sizes are the same, 1280 by 800. The phone on the other hand has a higher pixel density, so it has half as many density independent pixels as physical pixels. So a phone has 400 by 640 density independent pixels. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you have two devices with similar screen size, but different pixel density, say one is 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi), and the other is 400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi), we don't need to define totally different layouts for these two devices as we can measure assets in terms of density independent pixel which is same for both devices.</p>

<p>800 by 1280 pixels (320dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p>400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p><strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size.
For accessibility purposes, Android allows users to customize their device's font size. Users that have trouble reading text can increase their device's font size. You can normally find this option in the display setting on your phone or tablet under font size. It's often also available through the accessibility settings.</p>

<p>With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. But when device's font size is large, for example 125%, 16 sp will translate to 20 dp or 1.25 times 16.</p>

<p>If you use dp as the unit for font size, then that piece of text has a specific physical size no matter if the user has customize device's font size. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.</p>

","Density-independent pixels (dp or dip) and scale-independent pixels (sp) are units used in Android design to create assets that appear as expected on various screen resolutions and densities. 

1 dp is equal to 1 pixel at 160 dpi. The relationship is calculated as: px/dp = dpi/160dpi. This allows for consistent design across devices with different resolutions and densities.


Sp is the preferred unit for font size, as it adjusts to the user's customized font size, providing a better experience for those with impaired eyesight.","1 Formula

226953,228116,WCF and confirmations - do I need to send back a 'OK got it' to client?,"<p>There are three messaging patterns mentioned here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Synchronous request-response    </li>
<li>Asynchronous send (fire and forget with one-way service)</li>
<li>Asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service)</li>
</ol>

<p>All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. </p>

<p>For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate.</p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default configuration.</p>

<p>This returns a 200 response on the same http connection once the service has completed all its tasks. This means that calls to the service will block while waiting for the response - your client will hang until the service has written to the database and done anything else it needs.</p>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 returned indicates that the message has been accepted. From the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http rfc</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. (...) The 202 response is intentionally non-committal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. </p>

<hr>

<p>Below is some more info about implementing these patterns in WCF. After writing it, it is pretty long but there are a couple of useful comments as well as the code.</p>

<p>As Whisk mentioned, Juval Lowy has an article covering a lot this detail (and more!) <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163537.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default behaviour in WCF so you should not need to do anything - it works with lots of different bindings including wsHttpBinding and basicHttpBinding.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that the behaviour described with your client hanging waiting for the 200 response occurrs even if you have a void Operation like so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>To set an operation as one-way you simply decorate it as so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Methods decorated in this way must only have a return type of void. One gotcha is that the service will happily build and you won't get an exception saying the service config is invalid until you connect to it.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>The interface code for creating a duplex callback service is:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract(CallbackContract = typeof(IMyContractCallback))]
interface IMyContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay=true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}

public interface IMyContractCallback
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void ServiceResponse(string result);      
}
</code></pre>

<p>And on the client side you need something like so to set up the callback:</p>

<pre><code>public class CallbackHandler : IMyContractCallback        
{
    #region IEchoContractCallback Members

    public void ServiceResponse(string result)
    {
        //Do something with the response
    }

    #endregion
}

// And in the client when you set up the service call:

InstanceContext instanceContext = new InstanceContext(new CallbackHandler());
MyContractClient client = new MyContractClient(instanceContext);

InputMessage msg = new InputMessage();

client.DoSomething(msg);           
</code></pre>

<p>In the service you would perhaps have some code like:</p>

<pre><code>class MyContractImplementation : IMyContract
{
    public void DoSomeThing(MyMessage Message)
    {

        string responseMessage;

        try
        {
           //Write to the database
           responseMessage = ""The database call was good!"";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            responseMessage = ex.Message;
        }

        Callback.ServiceResponse(responseMessage);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. If you: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Consume an exception, you will get no warning of the error (but the callback will happen)</p></li>
<li><p>Throw an unhandled exception, the service will terminate and the client will not even get the callback.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown.</p>
","WCF messaging patterns: synchronous request-response, asynchronous send (one-way service), and asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service). The choice depends on the application's needs. For returning a success response to the client, synchronous request-response (200 response) or asynchronous request-response (202 response) are suitable options.

For synchronous request-response (200 response), the service call blocks until the response is received. For asynchronous request-response (202 response), the client continues execution after the service infrastructure starts processing, and a new thread waits for the service response.

To implement these patterns in WCF:

- For synchronous request-response (200 response), no additional configuration is required.
- For one-way service (202 response), decorate the operation with `[OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]`.
- For duplex callback service (202 response with callback), use an `InstanceContext` object to handle the callback and implement the callback interface on the client and service sides.","There are three messaging patterns mentioned here: Synchronous request-response All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs.","There are three messaging patterns mentioned here: All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate. Option 2
Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not. Option 3
Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. As Whisk mentioned, Juval Lowy has an article covering a lot this detail (and more!) One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown."

<p>The load time was measured inside Python (3.7.3), using the minimum wall-clock time over 20 runs on my desktop. According to occasional glances at <code>top</code> it always seemed to be running on a single core.</p>

<h3>For the curious: profiling</h3>

<p>I'm not sure if the Python version matters, most work is supposed to happen inside of C libraries. To validate this I've profiled the <code>pickle + lz4</code> variant:</p>

<pre><code>perf record ./test.py &amp;&amp; perf report -s dso
Overhead  Shared Object
  60.16%  [kernel.kallsyms]  # mostly page_fault and alloc_pages_vma
  27.53%  libc-2.28.so       # mainly memmove
   9.75%  liblz4.so.1.8.3    # only LZ4_decompress_*
   2.33%  python3.7
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>Most time is spent inside of the Linux kernel, doing <code>page_fault</code> and stuff associated with (re-)allocating memory, probably including disk I/O. The high amount of <code>memmove</code> looks suspicious. Probably Python is re-allocating (resizing) the final array every time a new decompressed chunk arrives. If anyone likes to have a closer look: <a href=""https://log2.ch/misc/unpickle-lz4/"" rel=""noreferrer"">python and perf profiles</a>.</p>
","Python decompression relative performance comparison:

Use `numpy.savez_compressed` for 2.3x faster loading compared to PIL-based code, utilizing `zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED`.

<ul>
<li>Though not produced by JetBrains, <a href=""https://cmake.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMake</a> is very central to CLion's operation.  Understanding CMake therefore helps greatly in diagnosing CLion build problems.  In particular CMake maintains a disk ""cache"" of settings which you may need to clear to incorporate changes to your environment (<em>Tools->CMake->Reset Cache and Reload Project</em>).</li>
<li><p>To make use of <em>OpenCV</em> in your build you must specify it in your project's <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> file.  You request that CMake locate your OpenCV location and link it to your <code>TARGET</code>.  An example of a sequence of commands from <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> for an executable named <code>mushroom</code> follows:
<code>
add_executable(mushroom ${SOURCE_FILES})
FIND_PACKAGE(OpenCV REQUIRED)

<p>(For more on <code>FIND_PACKAGE</code>, see <a href=""https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:How_To_Find_Libraries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMake:How To Find Libraries</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>FIND_PACKAGE</code> for package <em>XXX</em> works either by way of <em>FindXXX.cmake</em> files located at CMake's <code>Modules</code> directory, or by consulting environment variable <em>XXXX_DIR</em>.  On my system, no <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> file was present, so I relied on the <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> environment variable instead.  This must be set, not to the root of your OpenCV installation, but to the <em>build</em> folder beneath it.  I used an entry in <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> to set this variable, e.g.:</p>

<pre>set(OpenCV_DIR C:/Users/myacct/AppData/Local/opencv-3.0.0/build)</pre></li>
<li><p>To link with OpenCV, CMake uses either <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> or <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> (see previous point above) to locate a file named <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em>.  This file is generated by and ships with a particular build of OpenCV in order to document what components are present and where they are located.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Problems may occur when variable names used by OpenCVConfig.cmake conflict with those CLion has stored in its environment</em></strong>. In particular, if your OpenCV was built by Microsoft Visual C (<em>MSVC</em>), as is <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Windows distribution from opencv.org</a>, it won't work with CLion.    </p>

<p>Because CLion's build toolchain (<kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>S</kbd>-toolchain) uses either MinGW or Cygwin, <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> will search for OpenCV binaries under a subdirectory named <em>mingw</em> or <em>cygwin</em> <strong><em>and will find none</em></strong> because the binaries were built with MSVC (it will look in a directory like <em>vc11</em> or <em>vc12</em> instead).  This probably means <strong><em>you will need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</em></strong>.</p>

<p><em>Would reconfiguring OpenCVConfig.cmake to point to the MSVC binaries make this work?</em> you may ask.  Unfortunately the answer is still no, because <a href=""http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Interoperability_of_Libraries_Created_by_Different_Compiler_Brands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libraries built with one compiler typically cannot be linked with another one</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> or <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> likely contain diagnostic messages, but when CLion executes CMake for you, <code>message(STATUS)</code> calls are not displayed.  To make them display, change them to <code>message(WARNING)</code> or <code>message(FATAL_ERROR)</code>.  <em>But CLion 2016.3 EAP relieves this problem; see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/39398373/5025060"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/39398373/5025060</a>.</em></p></li>
<li><p>CLion does not indicate which .cmake script issued which diagnostics; don't assume they all come from the same script.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this provides some general guidance on resolving <em>CLion / CMake / OpenCV</em> compatibility problems.  Note that this does not cover <em>compiler</em> or <em>linker</em> issues; these will not appear until <em>CMake</em> completes its initial makefile build.

<p>Per <a href=""https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype-datetime.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the SQL standard all fields of an interval value must
  have the same sign, so a leading negative sign applies to all fields;
  for example the negative sign in the interval literal '-1 2:03:04'
  applies to both the days and hour/minute/second parts. PostgreSQL
  allows the fields to have different signs, and traditionally treats
  each field in the textual representation as independently signed, so
  that the hour/minute/second part is considered positive in this
  example. If IntervalStyle is set to sql_standard then a leading sign
  is considered to apply to all fields (but only if no additional signs
  appear). Otherwise the traditional PostgreSQL interpretation is used.
  To avoid ambiguity, it's recommended to attach an explicit sign to
  each field if any field is negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internally interval values are stored as months, days, and seconds.
  This is done because the number of days in a month varies, and a day
  can have 23 or 25 hours if a daylight savings time adjustment is
  involved. The months and days fields are integers while the seconds
  field can store fractions. Because intervals are usually created from
  constant strings or timestamp subtraction, this storage method works
  well in most cases. Functions justify_days and justify_hours are
  available for adjusting days and hours that overflow their normal
  ranges.</p>
</blockquote>
","Postgres intervals can have different formats due to separate calculations of date and time parts. To standardize the format, the `justify_hours` function can be used. However, for the reverse operation, a custom function `unjustify_hours` can be created:

```sql

returns interval language sql as $$
    select format('%s:%s',
        (extract (epoch from $1) / 3600)::int,

<p><strong>Yes</strong>, It's considered part of the best practices while working with javascript to include <em>Strict mode</em>. This is done by adding the below line of code in your JS file.</p>
<p><code>'use strict'; </code></p>
<p>in your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean to user agents?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indicating that code should be interpreted in strict mode specifies to user agents like browsers that they should treat code literally as written, and throw an error if the code doesn't make sense.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> Consider in your <code>.js</code> file you have the following code:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: [NO STRICT MODE]</strong></p>
<pre><code>var city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Prints the city name, i.e. Chicago

<pre><code>city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Prints the city name, i.e. Chicago
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>So why does the variable name is being printed in both cases?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without strict mode turned on, user agents often go through a series of modifications to problematic code in an attempt to get it to make sense. On the surface, this can seem like a fine thing, and indeed, working outside of strict mode makes it possible for people to get their feet wet with JavaScript code without having all the details quite nailed down. However, as a developer, I don't want to leave a bug in my code, because I know it could come back and bite me later on, and I also just want to write good code. And that's where strict mode helps out.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: [STRICT MODE]</strong></p>
<pre><code>'use strict';

city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Reference Error: asignment is undeclared variable city.
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>Additional tip:</strong></em> To maintain code quality using strict mode, you don't need to write this over and again especially if you have multiple <code>.js</code> file. You can enforce this rule globally in <code>eslint</code> rules as follows:</p>
<p><em>Filename:</em> <code>.eslintrc.js</code></p>
<pre><code>module.exports = {
    env: {
        es6: true
    },
    rules : {
        strict: ['error', 'global'],
        },
    };
    
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so what is prevented in strict mode?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Using a variable without declaring it</em> will throw an error in strict mode. This is to prevent unintentionally creating global variables throughout your application. The example with printing Chicago covers this in particular.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Deleting a variable or a function or an argument</em> is a no-no in strict mode.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;use strict&quot;;
 function x(p1, p2) {}; 
 delete x; // This will cause an error
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><em>Duplicating a parameter name</em> is <strong>not</strong> allowed in strict mode.</p>
<pre><code> &quot;use strict&quot;;
 function x(p1, p1) {};   // This will cause an error
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><em>Reserved words in the Javascript language are not allowed</em> in strict mode. The words are implements interface, let, packages, private, protected, public. static, and yield</p>
</li>
</ul>

","Strict mode in JavaScript eliminates errors that would be ignored in non-strict mode, making code ""more secured"". It's considered best practice to include it by adding `'use strict';` to the code. Strict mode specifies to user agents to treat code literally and throw an error if it doesn't make sense. This prevents issues like using undeclared variables, deleting variables or functions, duplicating parameter names, and using reserved words.","Strict mode eliminates errors that would be ignored in non-strict mode, thus making javascript “more secured”. <code>'use strict'; </code>

<p>Please check the function below written in non-strict mode:</p>

<pre><code>function getname(){
    name = ""Stack Overflow""; // Not using var keyword
    return name;
}
getname();
console.log(name); // Stack Overflow
</code></pre>

<p>In this function, we are using a variable called <code>name</code> inside the function. Internally, the compiler will first check if there is any variable declared with that particular name in that particular function scope. Since the compiler understood that there is no such variable, it will check in the outer scope. In our case, it is the global scope. Again, the compiler understood that there is also no variable declared in the global space with that name, so it creates such a variable for us in the global space. Conceptually, this variable will be created in the global scope and will be available in the entire application.</p>

<p>Another scenario is that, say, the variable is declared in a child function. In that case, the compiler checks the validity of that variable in the outer scope, i.e., the parent function. Only then it will check in the global space and create a variable for us there.
That means additional checks need to be done. This will affect the performance of the application.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now let's write the same function in strict mode.</p>

<pre><code>""use strict""
function getname(){
    name = ""Stack Overflow""; // Not using var keyword

<pre><code>Uncaught ReferenceError: name is not defined
at getname (&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:15)
at &lt;anonymous&gt;:6:5

<p>Here, the compiler throws the reference error. In strict mode, the compiler does not allow us to use the variable without declaring it. So memory leaks can be prevented. In addition, we can write more optimized code.</p>
","Strict mode in JavaScript prevents memory leaks by enforcing variable declarations. In non-strict mode, the compiler creates global variables if not declared within a function scope, affecting performance.

38315538,38316076,JavaScript | Angular | Controller As Syntax: Cannot Use `this`,"<p>The problem is certainly <strong>not</strong> that <code>this</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript.
There is no rule in the <em>controller as</em> syntax that says you would need to assign the value of <code>this</code> to a variable with the same name as the controller and I'm pertty sure angular won't do such thing either. Why would it? That would be incredibly stupid use of <code>Function</code> constructor and just a needless bug.</p>

<p>There's a simple way to test that JavaScript reserved words are not the issue here. Name your controller ""throw"". <code>""Parent as throw""</code>. <code>throw</code> is a reserved word, but does that <em>throw</em> errors? No. Does that work? Yes.</p>

<p><code>this</code> is, however, reserved in the context of angular's own template expressions. It's used to refer to the current <code>scope</code> of the expression.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=""Parent as this""&gt;
    {{log(this)}}
&lt;/div&gt;


angular.module('testApp', []).controller('Parent', function($scope){
    this.test = 'foo';
    $scope.log = function(arg){
        console.log(arg);
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>The above won't throw errors, but it won't log the controller either. Instead, it will log a <em>scope</em> object containing the <code>log</code> function and <code>$parent</code> and what not. </p>

<p>In fact, it will also contain something intresting to us: property <code>this: Object</code>, our controller. </p>

<p>And sure enough, change the template expression to <code>{{log(this.this)}}</code> and it will log the controller instance just fine. Still wouldn't use <code>'this'</code> as the name though, it would probably just cause more bugs by mistake than undefined functions ever have.</p>
","The issue with using ""this"" as the controller name in Angular's ""controller as"" syntax is due to its reserved meaning in Angular's template expressions, where ""this"" refers to the current scope.","No. Does that work? Yes.

1816723,1818235,Best practice for structuring a 'large' Rails app,"<p>I believe the benefits of isolating your concerns into separate apps outweigh the costs. I would probably start off with just 2 apps (one for the main site and superadmin, one for the client sites and admins), accessing the same database, but you could do 4.</p>

<p>The downside is you don't really have isolation since all your apps are tied to one database. You will eventually run into scaling problems with your database, but starting off simple with one database will get you launched. One strategy for scaling later would be to add a slave db that the client site and main site apps use, while the admin apps use the master db. This along with a TON of caching will get you pretty far.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with having multiple rails apps access one db, however you will need a way to share common code across your apps. Your models for the most part. I've done this before by tossing all my models in a plugin that I share as a sub-module in git or as an external in svn. Having separate apps will make each app smaller and easier to maintain.</p>

<p>However, where do you keep your migrations? Where do you test your models? I would opt for the superadmin app. Also, you make a change to a model or the schema, and now you have to check 2-4 apps and make sure they still work!</p>

<p>Better isolation, separate db's and inter-app communication through web APIs (SOA) and you don't have to worry about that. SOA I think is the way to go after a certain point, but SOA might be premature when you first start out.</p>

","A keyboard decoding system for a 9-key keyboard is implemented. The `KeyMap` array stores the corresponding characters for each key press phase. The `DecodeKey` function takes the new key press, old key, and phase as input and returns the resulting character. It validates the phase and key, updates the old key and phase if necessary, and returns the character. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `DecodeKey` function to print the resulting characters. 

Key code snippet: 
```c
char KeyMap[NUM_KEYS][NUM_PHASES] = ...
char DecodeKey(char NewKey, char *pOldKey, int *pPhase) {

<pre><code> filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
</code></pre>

<p>has to do with regular Prelude lists, not your <code>List</code>s -- i.e. <code>[a]</code> not <code>List a</code>. The error message arises because <code>filter</code> expects <code>a</code> in </p>

<pre><code> map f a = filter (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a
</code></pre>

<p>to be a list of something, but the signature you supplied declares that <code>a</code> is a <code>List</code> of something. Similarly <code>filter</code> returns a Prelude list of something, but the signature requires that it return a <code>List</code> of something. </p>

<p>The natural implementation of <code>map</code> for <code>List</code> would distinguish the cases of <code>List</code> that you gave in the type declaration, that is, it would ""pattern match"":</p>

<pre><code>mapList ::
    (a -&gt; b)
    -&gt; List a
    -&gt; List b
mapList f Nil = Nil
mapList f (t :. ls) = f t :. mapList f ls
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the program you wrote is perfectly valid, it just conflicts with the signature you gave it:</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let mapX f a = filter (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a
ghci&gt; :t mapX
mapX :: Eq a =&gt; t -&gt; [List a] -&gt; [List a]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Eq</code> constraint is required because you presuppose that <code>List</code>s be tested for equality and thus that their elements can be.  <code>f</code> is not used, so it just ends up as a 'could be anything' parameter, here <code>t</code>. </p>

<p>Of course, if you have your own <code>filterList</code> for <code>List</code>s it will also typecheck</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let filterList pred Nil = Nil; filterList pred (a :. as) = if pred a then a :. filterList pred as else filterList pred as

ghci&gt; :t filterList
filterList :: (t -&gt; Bool) -&gt; List t -&gt; List t

ghci&gt; :t mapY
mapY :: Eq a =&gt; t -&gt; List (List a) -&gt; List (List a)
</code></pre>

<p>What this function does is delete null elements from a List of Lists, like <code>Prelude.filter (not . Prelude.null)</code>. Similarly, the actual function you defined (without the signature) deleted <code>Nil</code> Lists from a <em>Prelude list</em> of your Lists.</p>
","The implementation of `map` on a custom `List` type is incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the `filter` function's signature and type constraints. The correct implementation should pattern-match on the `List` type, distinguishing between the `Nil` and `(t :. ls)` cases. 

```haskell
mapList :: (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
mapList f Nil = Nil
mapList f (t :. ls) = f t :. mapList f ls

<p>The advantages you gain when using the <strong>CSV Input</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>NIO: Native system calls for reading the file means faster performance, but it is limited to only local files currently. No VFS support.</li>
<li>Parallel running: If you configure this step to run in multiple copies or in clustered mode, and you enable parallel running, each copy will read a separate block of a single file allowing you to distribute the file reading to several threads or even several slave nodes in a clustered transformation.</li>
<li>Lazy conversion: If you will be reading many fields from the file and many of those fields will not be manipulate, but merely passed through the transformation to land in some other text file or a database, lazy conversion can prevent Kettle from performing unnecessary work on those fields such as converting them into objects such as strings, dates, or numbers.</li>

57038055,57085350,"What are ""Activations"", ""Activation Gradients"", ""Weights"" and ""Weight Gradients"" in Convolutional Neural Networks?","<p>This question is similar to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38136058/6873133"">this</a> question, but not quite. Also, <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs#example-code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the ConvNetJS example code with comments (<a href=""https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/docs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the full documentation). You can take a look at the code at the top of the demo page for the code itself.</p>

<p>An <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">activation function</a> is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some ""threshold"" (this is specific for each different activation function). This comes from how neurons work, where they take some electrical input and will only activate if they reach some threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 1:</strong> The first set of images show the raw input image (the left colored image) and the right of the two images is the output after going through the activation functions. You shouldn't really be able to interpret the second image because it is going through non-linear and perceived random non-linear transformations through the network.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 2:</strong> Similar to the previous point, the ""activations"" are the functions the image pixel information is passed into. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gradient</a> is essentially the slope of the activation function. It appears more sparse (i.e., colors show up in only certain places) because it shows possible areas in the image that each node is focusing on. For example, the 6th image on the first row has some color in the bottom left corner; this may indicate a large change in the activation function to indicate something interesting in this area. This <a href=""https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> may clear up some confusion on weights and activation functions. And <a href=""https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> has some really great visuals on what each step is doing.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 3:</strong> This confused me at first, because if you think about a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ReLu function</a>, you will see that it has a slope of one for positive <code>x</code> and 0 everywhere else. So to take the gradient (or slope) of the activation function (ReLu in this case) doesn't make sense. The ""max activation"" and ""min activation"" values make sense for a ReLu: the minimum value will be zero and the max is whatever the maximum value is. This is straight from the definition of a ReLu. <s>To explain the gradient values, I suspect that some Gaussian noise and a <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs/blob/4c3358a315b4d71f31a0d532eb5d1700e9e592ee/src/convnet_net.js#L43"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bias term of 0.1</a> has been added to those values.</s> <strong>Edit:</strong> the gradient refers to the slope of the cost-weight curve shown below. The y-axis is the loss value or the calculated error using the weight values <strong>w</strong> on the x-axis.</p>

","In Convolutional Neural Networks, ""activations"" refer to the output of activation functions that take input and produce values based on a threshold.

Migrating from Firebird 1.0 to Firebird 1.5 should be relatively easy (migrating to more recent versions like Firebird 2.5 might be more work).</p>
<p>For details look at the section <em>Common Problems: Firewalls</em> in <a href=""http://www.flamerobin.org/events_paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Power of Firebird Events</a> by Milan Babuškov:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client has a regular connection to Firebird server at its port (3050 by default, but can be changed). When it is registering for events, it sends the request over that connection. The server opens another connection at some random port (4012 for example) and sends that port number to the client. The client then connects to that port.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>When client registers for events, the server opens a random port (ex. 6023) and sends that info to the client. This is where the problem becomes evident: the client tries to connect to that port (6023) on the firewall (as it “sees” the firewall as a server). Since the port is completely random, there are certainly no forwarding rules for that port on the firewall, so connection is denied. Using this setup, there is no way to make it work, short of forwarding all the traffic (all ports) to Firebird server, which is the exact thing we wish to avoid by placing the firewall in front.</p>

<p>Is it important to implement autoCloseable in java?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to tell it is important or not to implement the interface. But it is not required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would it make sense if I create a class which implement AutoCloseable

<p>It is OK to do that. Nothing wrong.</p>
<p>AutoCloseable was added from Java 7. It is designed to use with new try-with-resources statement (Java 7+)</p>
<p>See two below classes providing the same functionality. One is not using AutoCloseable and the other is using AutoClosable:</p>
<pre><code>// Not use AutoClosable
public class CloseableImpl {
    public void doSomething() throws Exception { // ... }
    public void close() throws Exception { // ...}
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CloseableImpl impl = new CloseableImpl();
        try {
            impl.doSomething();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            // ex from doSomething
        } finally {

                impl.close();
            } catch (Exception e) { }
        }
    }
}

// Use AutoCloseable 
public class AutoCloseableImpl implements AutoCloseable {
    public void doSomething() throws Exception { // ... }

        } catch (Exception e) {

<p>As you see. Using AutoClosble will make the code shorter and cleaner.</p>
","AutoCloseable in Java is not required, but it's beneficial when using the try-with-resources statement (introduced in Java 7). This statement automatically calls the close() method on AutoCloseable objects, making the code cleaner and shorter.

<p>I wish I could say that this fixes the problem 100% of the time, however, that doesn't seem to be the case. Every once in awhile, I still seem to run into bounds exceptions like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This could be due to other factors, such as my semi-complex filtering code, but as I can’t actually see what Apple’s doing in its <code>NSTableView</code> methods like <code>_updateVisibleViewsBasedOnUpdateItems</code>, I’m just not sure.</p>

```r

<p>The basic idea is to separate the identity of a participant from the role they play in an activity.</p>

<p>For example, you might have a Person object that captures the identify of a particular person.</p>

<p>Then, a completely separate object ""Student"" that captures the additional information to record the enrolment of a person as a student. Each instance of Student would have a reference to the person enrolled. A single person may be related to many ""Student"" records, one for each distinct enrolment.</p>

<p>In parallel, you could have a distinct ""Tutor"" object that records employment details when someone is hired to teach students in one-on-one situations. The Tutor object captures the additional details around how someone is employed as a tutor.</p>

<p>This structure gives you great flexibility - one person (Joe Bloggs) may just be a student, another person (Jane Doe) may just be a tutor, and a third (Chuck Norris) may be both.</p>

<p>With this statement,</p>

<pre><code>public class Derived1 : Base&lt;Derived1&gt; {

<p>you're using Derived1 in two different ways according to the base class.  </p>

<p>You're effectively telling the C# compiler that Derived1 both: </p>

<ol>
<li>inherits Base </li>
<li>and Base uses instances of Derived1 through non-inheritance means.  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is not wrong (if that's what you really want), but it's unusual for most programming scenarios; you normally choose one or the other.

<p>One problem I see in the Base class is it turns into a kind of circular scenario when using the factory method as intended, because, to support all derived classes it would need to support something like <code>class Base&lt;T&gt; where T:Base&lt;T&gt;</code>. That's next to impossible to declare because you would have to say in a circular fashion: <code>Base&lt;Base&lt;Base&lt;!!!&gt;&gt;&gt; baseref = null;</code> where !!! represents an infinite number of the same. </p>

<p>For a simple printing of the array, I'm not sure how this code helps you. Without the context of the surrounding code, it's difficult for me to speculate as to what the code is doing.</p>

<p>It looks like you're trying to do your own equivalent of <code>printf(""%d"",num)</code>, but there is already a syscall to output an integer to the screen. I'd use that. But ... If you truly need to ""roll your own"", I've included code to do that.</p>

<p>Printing the array is similar to the input of the array.</p>

<p>I've reworked the previous example code. The input of the array is now a function. I removed the hardwired limit value of 250 in favor of using a new label: <code>arrend</code> [so, have a look]</p>

<p>Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array.</p>

<p>To manually do what syscall 1 does, I've added the <code>prtint</code> function. <code>arrprt</code> will use the syscall, but if you want it to use <code>prtint</code>, comment out the syscall and uncomment the block that calls <code>prtint</code></p>

Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array."

<p>EDIT (brief-ish explanation):</p>

<p>What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids]. It looked like:</p>

<p>An ActiveRecord 'find' method can take an array of ids, but not a hash of values. What you were originally submitting to 'find' in this line:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(params[:name_ids])

""which""=&gt;""Молдавская""}
</code></pre>

<p>When what you wanted was:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(['7','1','4'])
</code></pre>

<p>which is what calling params[:name_ids].keys gives you. </p>

<p>The second problem was this line:</p>

<pre><code>name.update_attributes!(params[:name].reject { |k,v| v.blank? })
</code></pre>

<p>There was no value ':name' in params, so calling 'reject' on it cause the 'no method' error -- there is no 'reject' method on the nil object. What you wanted was to update the attributes for the 'name' that corresponded to the particular name in the loop. This meant you wanted to get the values out of params[:name_ids][:id] where :id was the id of 'name'. </p>

<p>It all goes back to the way fields_for created the params to begin with. This line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% fields_for ""name_ids[#{name.id}]"", name do |name_fields| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>meant that params would contain a hash called 'name_ids', with keys corresponding to name.id, that themselves would contain hashes of attributes that ActiveRecord could use in the update_attributes method. </p>

<p>There's a good bit of the famous Rails magic to keep track of in there -- does that help?</p>
","The issue arises from using a nested hash in `params[:name_ids]`. To fix it, use `params[:name_ids].keys` to get an array of IDs, and update the `find` method accordingly. Additionally, the `params[:name]` reference is `nil`, so use `params[:name_ids][name.id.to_s]` to access the corresponding hash.

```ruby
@names = Name.find(params[:name_ids].keys)
@names.each do |name|
  name.update_attributes!(params[:name_ids][name.id.to_s].reject { |k,v| v.blank? })

You could also do it with two tables for articles and an articles_tags table.  The articles_tags table would contain an articleID field and the tag itself as a compound key.  Either two or three tables makes it easy to find which articles have a given tag and which tags are assigned to a given article.</p>

<p>Q2 - title and description searches could be done using ""like"" with percents or with regex or full text search.</p>

<p>Q3 - don't worry about joining the tags tables with the others.  To paraphrase Knuth, build it first, then find the bottlenecks.  MySQL is very good at what it does.  Joining those tables together over and over and over again won't hurt.  </p>

<p>Q4 - It depends what you want to get out of the results.  usually you want the actual data and then you can just test for the number of rows returned to tell you whether it's true or false.</p>

18484535,18486496,maintaining cache state in different servers,"<p>If you ultimately decide to move the cache outside your main webserver process, then you could also take a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing"" rel=""nofollow"">consistent hashing</a>. This would be a alternative to a replicated cache.</p>

<p>The problem with replicated caches, is they scale inversely proportional to the number of nodes participating in the cache. i.e. their performance degrades as you add additional nodes. They work fine when there is a small number of nodes. If data is to be replicated between N nodes (or you need to send eviction messages to N nodes), then every write requires 1 write to the cache on the originating node, and N-1 writes to the other nodes.</p>

<p>In consistent hashing, you instead define a hashing function, which takes the key of the data you want to store or retrieve as input, and it returns the id of the server in the cluster which is responsible for caching the data for that key. So each caching server is responsible for a fraction of the overall keys, the client can determine which server will contain the sought data without any lookup, and data and eviction messages do not need to be replicated between caching servers.</p>

<p>The ""consistent"" part of consistent hashing, refers to how your hashing function handles new servers being added to or removed from the cluster: some re-distribution of keys between servers is required, but the function is designed to minimize the amount of such disruption.</p>

<p>In practice, you do not actually need a dedicated caching cluster, as your caches could run in-process in your web servers; each web server being able to determine the other webserver which should store cache data for a key.</p>

<p>Consistent hashing is used at large scale. It might be overkill for you at this stage. But just be aware of the scalability bottleneck inherent in O(N) messaging architectures. A replicated cache is possibly a good idea to <em>start with</em>.</p>

<p>EDIT: Take a look at <a href=""http://infinispan.org/docs/5.3.x/faqs/faqs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Infinispan</a>, a distributed cache which indeed uses consistent hashing out of box.</p>

19389238,19398077,Why do the following program leaks memory?,"<p>You're not doing anything wrong. GTK widgets use reference counting, but in your programme all the references are taken care of, so you're not (manually) leaking anything.</p>

<p>So why does Valgrind claim you are?</p>

<p>Firstly, GLib has its own ""slab"" memory allocator, called <code>GSlice</code>, which is generally faster than system <code>malloc</code> for small allocations. Unfortunately, it confuses Valgrind, but if you set the environment variable <code>G_SLICE=always-malloc</code>, <code>GSlice</code> is effectively turned off.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can set the <code>G_DEBUG=gc-friendly</code>, which is supposed to help Valgrind produce more accurate results (although it my experience it generally doesn't make any difference).</p>

<p>Both of these environment variables are listed in the <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.38/glib-running.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GLib documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, Valgrind will still report that your app leaks memory. The reason for this is that GTK (and its underlying libraries) allocate some ""static"" memory at start-up that doesn't get freed until the programme quits. This isn't really a problem, because typically the programme ends as soon as <code>gtk_main()</code> returns, and then the OS frees any remaining resources, so you're not <em>really</em> leaking anything. Valgrind thinks you are though, and for this reason it would be nice to have a <code>gtk_deinit()</code> function, but sadly there isn't one.</p>

<p>The best you can do instead is to teach Valgrind to ignore these things, via a suppressions file. The <a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/Valgrind"" rel=""nofollow"">Valgrind page on the Gnome Wiki</a> has details on all this and more.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that there are some easier ways for you to reset the pointer. You can actually do it without using <code>nRreset</code>; since the base address for <code>newResBuffer</code> never changes, you can simply reset it with <code>nR = newResBuffer</code>.  </p>

<p>An even easier way to do it would be not to use a moving pointer at all and simply use the variable <code>j</code> you already have in your code to index <code>newResBuffer</code>.  </p>

<p>You can also use <code>atoi()</code> or <code>strtol()</code> instead of <code>sscanf()</code> to convert the string buffer to an <code>int</code> (or <code>long</code>).  </p>

<p>Here's a simpler version of the code which achieves the same thing:  </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    char newResBuffer[10];
    char rxRead = 0;
    int newRes = 0;
    int newResFlag = 0;
    int j = 0;

    while (1) {
        /* if (U1STAbits.URXDA) { */
        if (rand() % 2) {
            /* rxRead = U1RXREG &amp; 0xFF; */
            rxRead = getc(stdin);
            newResBuffer[j++] = rxRead;

            if (j &gt; 4) {
                newResBuffer[j] = '\0';
                newResFlag = 1;
                j = 0;
            }
        }

        if (newResFlag) {
            newRes = atoi(newResBuffer);
            /* MAXCNT = (newRes * 2) - 1; */
            printf(""newRes: %d\n"", newRes);

<a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2528952"" rel=""nofollow"">[GUIDE] Genymotion | Installing ARM Translation and GApps[Updated Nov.16]</a>
I experienced the DnD issue as well, read below for how I worked around it
I did <em>not</em> install the GAPPs zip. It's not needed and causes a lot of crash notifications.</li>
<li>Extract up-to-date Chrome APK from my actual android device. APK's for installed apps can be found in /data/app (but this my require root) or you could use a back-up solution to extract it.</li>
<li>Install the obtained APK by also DnD'ing it into the home screen, it will automatically install.
... And it worked.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the DnD issue, in my case the cause appeared to be that I was running Genymotion 'as administrator' (Why? Complicated: Because I have an unrelated virtualBox machine using a native disk image, which requires me to start virtualbox in privileged mode, which will crash Genymotion if it's not also running in privileged mode). However when I started GenyMotion not 'as admin' the dnd issue did not appear.
If this is not the issue in your case I think you can still get the stuff installed without DnD support:</p>

<ul>
<li>First get the files on your image in some way, use your imagination (or any file sharing web service)</li>
<li>Also get an APK for a decent file explorer with ZIP and root support. I use ES file explorer and my instructions will be based in it. I suggest, as for Chrome itself, to install it on your actual phone first and then grab the APK.</li>
<li>Install the file explorer, start it and become root (ES crashed the first couple of times in my case, but after some tries it worked)</li>
<li>make sure /system is mounted as r/w. in ES, use menu->root explorer->mount R/W, put /system on RW</li>
<li>Locate the Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1.zip, browse into it, select (long press) 'system' folder, extract to, 'choose path', point to /. The Zip will now be 'installed'</li>
<li>Go back to root explorer options, put /system back to RO</li>
<li>Reboot the emulator (in my case it crashed both on shutdown and first boot; I just closed the emulator after a few minutes and tried again. Then it worked)</li>
<li>Now you should be able to install the Chrome APK</li>
</ul>
","To install Google Play/Chrome browser on Genymotion, install the libhoudini and extract an up-to-date Chrome APK from an Android device. Then, DnD the APK onto the Genymotion home screen for automatic installation. Alternatively, without DnD support, use a file explorer with root capabilities (e.g., ES file explorer), mount the system as R/W, extract the Genymotion-ARM-Translation.zip to the system folder, and reboot the emulator.","Extract up-to-date Chrome APK from my actual android device.

<p>With experience, a good set of compiler options, a static source code analyzer, a dynamic analyzer, ... anything you know how to use. If you don't know how to use such, I'm afraid that you have to learn.</p>

<p>You can find the worst problems by raising the warning level of your compiler to the max and even give option like <code>-pedantic</code> for GCC. The same applies to the analyzers of which the static kind is quite simple to use.</p>

<p>Then you can build tables of possible control and data flows. For instance <code>scanf()</code> can do anything of these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read nothing at all into <code>t1</code> leaving it completely uninitialized, perhaps because of I/O errors.</li>
<li>Read a zero length string; just one character, <code>'\0'</code>, will be stored in <code>t1</code>.</li>
<li>Read anything between the previous and the next length.</li>
<li>Read a string filling <code>t1</code> up to the last character, but not overflowing it.</li>
<li>Read a string longer than <code>t1</code> provides space for.</li>
<li>Read a string very much longer than <code>t1</code> provides space for.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of these might have the same effect, beware. Then think about what will happen further down the control flow.</p>

<p>Do this for every function call, every assignment, and every instruction. Some instructions are simple and don't do any harm, others are quite tricky. You have to read the documentation of the functions carefully, and the C standard, may be more than one version of it.</p>

<p>The code?</p>

<p><strong>Some other Tree options</strong> :</p>
<p>On each state(or Node) there is a search problem. linear search is the worst case option so most strategies improved their search time by using either sorting( <em>O(nlog(n)</em> ) and then using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Binary search</a>( <em>O(log(n)</em>) ) or using a hashtable ( <em>O(1)</em>, fast but has more space complexity). encountering so many trade-off dilemmas, other tree data structure variants like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Radix Tree</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Suffix Tree</a>, <a href=""http://suggesttree.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Suggest Tree</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Merkle Tree</a> may come useful.</p>

<p>Notice how the predicates happen before the <code>VIEW</code>, and both indexes are used.  By default everything should work as well as can be expected.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<p>This type of query structure is called an inline view.  Although a physical table is not built, the phrase ""internal tables"" is a good way of thinking about how the query logically works.  Ideally, an inline view would work exactly like a pre-built table with the same data.  In reality there are <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/19338530/409172"">some cases</a> where things don't quit work that way.  But in general you are definitely on the right path - build a large query by assembling small inline views, and assume that Oracle will optimize it correctly.</p>
","Oracle will treat an inline view as a table and apply filters and indexes to it, as shown in the explain plan. This allows for efficient table scanning on internal tables. Key points include:

* Predicate pushing applies filters to the base tables before the inline view
* Indexes can be used on the inline view
* The explain plan shows the optimization process

<p>It isn't Service Locator either, because it is not locating services - now this requires a few words of explanation.</p>

<p>Service locator should return distinct interfaces. Your method is returning objects implementing a single common interface. Here is the signature of a Service Locator:</p>

<pre><code>T LocateService&lt;T&gt;() { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the dreaded signature which has caused so much troubles to developers worldwide. The problem is that signature of this method doesn't tell what is the kind of objects the consumer may depend on. Let me show it with a longer example:</p>

<pre><code>class ServiceLocator {
    T Locate&lt;T&gt;();
}

class Golum {

    ServiceLocator locator;

    Consumer(ServiceLocator depedency) { ... }

    void beNice() {
        Preciousss myPrecious = this.locator.Locate&lt;Previousss&gt;();
        myPrecious.DoMagic();
    }
}

void main() {
    new Golum(new ServiceLocator()).beNice(); // Fails!
}
</code></pre>

<p>This piece of code is the sublimation of all evil that comes with misuse of service locators. Main function is initializing the Golum class, but it has no clue what Golum requires. Golum just asks for a service locator, any service locator, and then gets going. When beNice method is invoked, it turns that particular service locator object that was passed has no knowledge of the Preciousss class at all, and then call to Locate fails.</p>

<p>Bottom line, negative consequences appear when a class doesn't declare its dependencies explicitly. And if you take a look at your case, this is not what happens there. Your class depends on SomeInterface and then asks for the resolver object which also knows of SomeInterface. I don't see negative consequences there.</p>

<p>When talking about naming, I might choose to call that ""locator"" object something like SomeInterfaceLookup, although SomeInterfaceLocator wouldn't be any worse than that.</p>

<p>Of course this is a very generalized scenario and some things should be taken into account, such as the use of the <code>querySelectorAll</code>, which should be more specific probably, then searching the whole document for nodes with classes. Second is the transformation of the <code>nodesWithClass</code> <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTMLCollection</a> into an Array by using an ES2015 trick (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/222841/104380"">this question</a>).</p>
","Using `document.querySelectorAll(""[class]"")`, the code iterates over nodes with a `class` attribute and removes it if the attribute is empty after trimming whitespace. 

```javascript
[...nodesWithClass].forEach(node => node.removeAttribute('class'));
```

Note: This approach may have performance implications due to the non-specific query and array transformation.","Takes into account empty spaces within the <code>class</code> attribute: Of course this is a very generalized scenario and some things should be taken into account, such as the use of the <code>querySelectorAll</code>, which should be more specific probably, then searching the whole document for nodes with classes.

<p>This very sample code in my question is never meant to be a self-contained service/client code: It is a server-only app with <code>ZMQ_REP</code> socket. It just waits for any client code to send request through <code>ZMQ_REQ</code> sockets. So the ""hang"" that I was seeing is completely normal!</p>

<p>As soon as I hook up a client app to it, things start rolling instantly. This chapter is somewhere in the middle of the Guide and I was only concerned with multithreading so I skipped many code samples and messaging patterns, which led to my confusion. </p>

<p>The code comments even said it's a server, but I expected to see explicit confirmation from the program. So to be fair the lack of visual cue and the compiler deprecation warning caused me to question the sample code as a new user, but the story that the code tells is valid.</p>

<p>Such a shame on wasted time! But all of a sudden all @user3666197 says in his answer starts to make sense.</p>

","Filtering a list in React by gender or age involves two main issues. 

To fix the first issue in the `filterGender` function, directly compare the gender instead of using `indexOf`. Use `user.gender.toLowerCase() === lowerCaseGender`.

To fix the second issue, use a separate `this.list` variable to filter records and update the state. Define `this.list` in the `constructor` and assign it to the response data in the `getList` function. Update the `filterGender` and `filterAge` functions to use `this.list` instead of `this.state.list`. 


```javascript
filterGender = gender => {
  const lowerCaseGender = gender.toLowerCase();
  const filteredGender = this.list.filter(user => user.gender.toLowerCase() === lowerCaseGender);
  this.setState({ list: filteredGender }, () => console.log(this.state.list));
};

filterAge = () => {
  const ageList = this.list.map(age => age.dob);
  const filteredAge = this.list.filter(e => ageList.includes(e.dob));
  this.setState({ list: filteredAge }, () => console.log(this.state.list));
};

","To filter a list by gender or age in React, use `Array.filter` for gender and `Array.sort` for age. 

For gender filtering, replace the `indexOf` function with `filter` and compare the user's gender with the input using `toLowerCase()`:

filterGender = gender => {
  const filteredGender = this.state.list.filter(user => user.gender.toLowerCase() === gender);
  this.setState({ list: filteredGender }, () => console.log(this.state.list));

filterAge = () => {

    return new Date(b.dob) - new Date(a.dob);

438062,438174,MySQL select records that sums,"<p>I don't understand your question too well. Can you try rewording it more properly? From what I interpret, here's the structure of your database:</p>

<pre><code>ProductID    ArrivalDate
   1          10
   2          11
   3          11
   4          11
   5          12
   6          12
</code></pre>

<p>Now you are asking, ""how would I know <strong>which</strong> price had each product I sold""? Which sorta confuses me, since each value in the database has no price attribute. Shouldn't your database look like this:</p>

<pre><code>ProductID    ArrivalDate    Price
   1          10              100
   2          11              200

<p>Personally, I think your idea to find out price sold is flawed. It would make more sense to add a few more fields to your database:</p>

<pre><code>ProductID    ArrivalDate    Price     InStock   DateSold
   1          10              100       Yes        17

<p>In changing your database, you can easily keep track of when a product arrives, the date sold, its price, maybe quantity (I can't tell if its an actual field or not). </p>

<p>Furthermore, you can simplify and make your life easier by separating the sql queries, or even adding some code to do some of the work for you.</p>
","The question seems to be about selecting records that sum a specific value, but the provided answer doesn't directly address the question. Instead, it suggests improving the database structure to include a ""Price"" and ""DateSold"" column to track sales. The recommended database structure:

","A generic Java framework to manage bidirectional associations and inverse updates is proposed. It uses a package-private mechanism to maintain consistency between associated objects. 

Key classes A and B have the following structure:

```java
public final class A {
    private B b;
    public B getB() { return b; }
    public void setB(final B b) {
        // update b's reference, add/remove self from b's list
    }
}

public final class B {
    private final List<A> as;
    public void addA(A a) { as.add(a); }
    public void removeA(A a) { as.remove(a); }
    public List<A> getAs() { return Collections.unmodifiableList(as.stream().filter(a -> a.getB() == this).collect(Collectors.toList())); }
}
```

This framework ensures that both objects are aware of each other's existence and updates are propagated correctly.","To make sense, these calsses will be peers.

169420,169758,Generic Java Framework to Manage Bidirectional Associations and Inverse Updates,"<p>Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism.  If your objects are JavaBeans, then you are looking at using PropertyChangeSupport and firing property change events.</p>

<p>If you do that (or have some other mechanism for detecting changes), then Glazed Lists provides an <a href=""http://publicobject.com/glazedlists/glazedlists-1.5.0/api/ca/odell/glazedlists/ObservableElementList.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ObservableElementList</a> that could easily be used to handle the association synchronization from the list end (i.e. adding A to List&lt; A> automatically calls a.setB(b)).  The other direction is easily handled using property change monitoring (or equivalent).</p>

<p>I realize that this isn't a generic solution, but it seems like it would be an easy foundation for one.</p>

<p>Note that something like this would <em>require</em> a special list implementation in the B class - no way short of AOP type solutions that you could handle it in the general case (i.e. using ArrayList or something like that).</p>

<p>I should also point out that what you are trying to achieve is something of the holy grail of data binding.  There are some decent implementations for binding at the field level (stuff like getters and setters) (see JGoodies binding and JSR 295 for examples).  There is also one really good implementation for list type binding (Glazed Lists, referred to above).  We use both techniques in concert with each other in almost all of our applications, but have never tried to go quite as abstract as what you are asking about.</p>

<p>If I were designing this, I would look at something like this:</p>

<pre><code>AssociationBuilder.createAssociation(A a, Connector&lt; A&gt; ca, B b,  Connector&lt; B&gt; cb, Synchronizer&lt; A,B&gt; sync)
</code></pre>

<p>Connector is an interface that allows for a single interface for various change notification types.  Synchronizer is an interface that is called to make sure both objects are in sync whenever one of them is changed.</p>

<pre><code>sync(ChangeInfo info, A a, B b) // make sure that b reflects current state of a and vice-versa.  
</code></pre>

<p>ChangeInfo provides data on which member changed, and what the changes actually were.  We are.  If you are trying to really keep this generic, then you pretty much have to punt the implementation of this up to the framework user.</p>

<p>With the above in place, it would be possible to have a number of pre-defined Connectors and Synchronizers that meet different binding criteria.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the above method signature is pretty similar to the JSR 295 createAutoBinding() method call.  Property objects are the equivalent of Connector.  JSR 295 doesn't have the Synchronizer (instead, they have a binding strategy specified as an ENUM - plus JSR 295 works only with property->property binding, trying to bind a field value of one object to that object's list membership in another object is not even on the table for them).</p>
","To manage bidirectional associations and inverse updates in Java, use a mechanism for detecting changes, such as PropertyChangeSupport. Implement a special list in the B class and use Glazed Lists' ObservableElementList to handle association synchronization. Alternatively, design an AssociationBuilder with a Connector interface for change notification and a Synchronizer interface to ensure both objects are in sync.","If you do that (or have some other mechanism for detecting changes), then Glazed Lists provides an ObservableElementList that could easily be used to handle the association synchronization from the list end (i.e. adding A to List&lt; A&gt; automatically calls a.setB(b)).
