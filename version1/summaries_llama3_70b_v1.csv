2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View). In some cases the model can also be used to turn a data source into a higher level abstraction as well. A good example of this is the MVC Storefront project. There is a discussion here regarding the differences between MVC vs MVP. The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view. Having said that, ASP.NET MVC is by these definitions an MVP framework because the Controller accesses the Model to populate the View which is meant to have no logic (just  displays the variables provided by the Controller). To perhaps get an idea of the ASP.NET MVC distinction from MVP, check out this MIX presentation by Scott Hanselman.","MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are frameworks that separate concerns in an application, dividing it into a data source (Model), application logic (Controller/Presenter), and display code (View).

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Wikipedia Article. To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. Instead of your program explicitly controlling everything, your program sets up a class or library with certain functions to be called when certain things happen. It solves code duplication. For example, in the old days you would manually write your own event loop, polling the system libraries for new events. Nowadays, most modern APIs you simply tell the system libraries what events you're interested in, and it will let you know when they happen. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control. Inversion of control is made easy in many languages through the concept of delegates, interfaces, or even raw function pointers. It is not appropriate to use in all cases, because the flow of a program can be harder to follow when written this way. It's a useful way to design methods when writing a library that will be reused, but it should be used sparingly in the core of your own program unless it really solves a code duplication problem.","Inversion of Control (IoC) is a programming technique that involves turning sequential code into a delegation structure, where a class or library is set up to perform specific functions when certain events occur. This approach helps reduce code duplication by allowing the program to define what events it's interested in, rather than manually polling for them. IoC is facilitated by concepts like delegates, interfaces, and function pointers, and is useful for designing reusable libraries, but should be used judiciously in core program code to avoid complicating the program flow.","To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Inversion of Control is what you get when your program callbacks, e.g. like a gui program. For example, in an old school menu, you might have: thereby controlling the flow of user interaction. In a GUI program or somesuch, instead we say So now control is inverted... instead of the computer accepting user input in a fixed order, the user controls the order in which the data is entered, and when the data is saved in the database. Basically, anything with an event loop, callbacks, or execute triggers falls into this category.","Inversion of Control refers to a programming paradigm where the flow of control is reversed, allowing users to dictate the order of interactions, rather than the program controlling it.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"The Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) patterns are all about removing dependencies from your code. For example, say your application has a text editor component and you want to provide spell checking. Your standard code would look something like this: What we've done here creates a dependency between the <code>TextEditor</code> and the <code>SpellChecker</code>. In an IoC scenario we would instead do something like this: In the first code example we are instantiating <code>SpellChecker</code> (<code>this.checker = new SpellChecker();</code>), which means the <code>TextEditor</code> class directly depends on the <code>SpellChecker</code> class. In the second code example we are creating an abstraction by having the <code>SpellChecker</code> dependency class in <code>TextEditor</code> constructor signature (not initializing dependency in class). This allows us to call the dependency then pass it to the TextEditor class like so: Now the client creating the <code>TextEditor</code> class has the control over which <code>SpellChecker</code> implementation to use because we're injecting the dependency to the <code>TextEditor</code> signature. This is just a simple example, there's a good series of articles by Simone Busoli that explains it in greater detail.","Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that removes dependencies from code by decoupling objects. It achieves this through Dependency Injection (DI), where a dependent object is passed to a class rather than being instantiated within it. This allows the client to control which implementation of the dependent object to use, promoting flexibility and loose coupling. In the example given, the `TextEditor` class no longer directly depends on the `SpellChecker` class, but instead, the `SpellChecker` is injected into the `TextEditor` constructor, giving the client control over which `SpellChecker` implementation to use.",The Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) patterns are all about removing dependencies from your code.

9,How do I calculate someone's age in C#?,"This is the version we use here. It works, and it's fairly simple. It's the same idea as Jeff's but I think it's a little clearer because it separates out the logic for subtracting one, so it's a little easier to understand. You could expand the ternary operator to make it even clearer, if you think that sort of thing is unclear. Obviously this is done as an extension method on <code>DateTime</code>, but clearly you can grab that one line of code that does the work and put it anywhere. Here we have another overload of the Extension method that passes in <code>DateTime.Now</code>, just for completeness.","To calculate someone's age in C#, you can use a simple extension method on the `DateTime` class that subtracts the birth date from the current date, taking into account the current month and day to determine if the person has had their birthday this year.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"MVP: the view is in charge. The view, in most cases, creates its presenter. The presenter will interact with the model and manipulate the view through an interface. The view will sometimes interact with the presenter, usually through some interface. This comes down to implementation; do you want the view to call methods on the presenter or do you want the view to have events the presenter listens to? It boils down to this: The view knows about the presenter. The view delegates to the presenter. MVC: the controller is in charge. The controller is created or accessed based on some event/request. The controller then creates the appropriate view and interacts with the model to further configure the view. It boils down to: the controller creates and manages the view; the view is slave to the controller. The view does not know about the controller.","MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are two architectural patterns. The key difference is:

* In MVP, the **View** is in charge, creates its Presenter, and delegates tasks to it. The View knows about the Presenter.
* In MVC, the **Controller** is in charge, creates and manages the View, and the View does not know about the Controller.",The view does not know about the controller.,MVP: the view is in charge. MVC: the controller is in charge.
2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Also worth remembering is that there are different types of MVPs as well. Fowler has broken the pattern into two - Passive View and Supervising Controller. When using Passive View, your View typically implement a fine-grained interface with properties mapping more or less directly to the underlaying UI widget. For instance, you might have a ICustomerView with properties like Name and Address. Your implementation might look something like this: Your Presenter class will talk to the model and ""map"" it to the view. This approach is called the ""Passive View"". The benefit is that the view is easy to test, and it is easier to move between UI platforms (Web, Windows/XAML, etc.). The disadvantage is that you can't leverage things like databinding (which is really powerful in frameworks like WPF and Silverlight). The second flavor of MVP is the Supervising Controller. In that case your View might have a property called Customer, which then again is databound to the UI widgets. You don't have to think about synchronizing and micro-manage the view, and the Supervising Controller can step in and help when needed, for instance with compled interaction logic. The third ""flavor"" of MVP (or someone would perhaps call it a separate pattern) is the Presentation Model (or sometimes referred to Model-View-ViewModel). Compared to the MVP you ""merge"" the M and the P into one class. You have your customer object which your UI widgets is data bound to, but you also have additional UI-spesific fields like ""IsButtonEnabled"", or ""IsReadOnly"", etc. I think the best resource I've found to UI architecture is the series of blog posts done by Jeremy Miller over at The Build Your Own CAB Series Table of Contents. He covered all the flavors of MVP and showed C# code to implement them. I have also blogged about the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in the context of Silverlight over at YouCard Re-visited: Implementing the ViewModel pattern.","The Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern has different types, including Passive View and Supervising Controller. 

1. **Passive View**: The View implements a fine-grained interface with properties mapping to UI widgets, and the Presenter maps the Model to the View. This approach makes the View easy to test and allows for easy switching between UI platforms, but it can't leverage features like data binding.

2. **Supervising Controller**: The View has properties that are data-bound to UI widgets, and the Presenter helps with complex interaction logic. This approach eliminates the need for synchronizing and micro-managing the View.

3881,IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?,"I tend to follow the design of JDK libraries, especially Collections and Concurrency (Joshua Bloch, Doug Lea, those guys know how to design solid APIs). Anyway, many APIs in the JDK pro-actively throws <code>NullPointerException</code>. For example, the Javadoc for <code>Map.containsKey</code> states: @throws NullPointerException if the key is null and this map     does not permit null keys (optional). It's perfectly valid to throw your own NPE. The convention is to include the parameter name which was null in the message of the exception. The pattern goes: Whatever you do, don't allow a bad value to get set and throw an exception later when other code attempts to use it. That makes debugging a nightmare.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"MVP is not necessarily a scenario where the View is in charge (see Taligent's MVP for example). I find it unfortunate that people are still preaching this as a pattern (View in charge) as opposed to an anti-pattern as it contradicts ""It's just a view"" (Pragmatic Programmer). ""It's just a view"" states that the final view shown to the user is a secondary concern of the application. Microsoft's MVP pattern renders re-use of Views much more difficult and conveniently excuses Microsoft's designer from encouraging bad practice. To be perfectly frank, I think the underlying concerns of MVC hold true for any MVP implementation and the differences are almost entirely semantic. As long as you are following separation of concerns between the view (that displays the data), the controller (that initialises and controls user interaction) and the model (the underlying data and/or services)) then you are acheiving the benefits of MVC. If you are acheiving the benefits then who really cares whether your pattern is MVC, MVP or Supervising Controller? The only real pattern remains as MVC, the rest are just differing flavours of it. Consider this highly exciting article that comprehensively lists a number of these differing implementations. You may note that they're all basically doing the same thing but slightly differently. I personally think MVP has only been recently re-introduced as a catchy term to either reduce arguments between semantic bigots who argue whether something is truly MVC or not or to justify Microsofts Rapid Application Development tools.

34510,What is a race condition?,"Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems. A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do. This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access. There's almost always a race condition when one thread calls sleep to give another thread time to finish a task (unless that sleep is in a loop, with some checking mechanism). Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals. Mutexes are good when you want to make sure you're the only one doing something. Signals are good when you want to make sure someone else has finished doing something. Minimizing shared resources can also help prevent unexpected behaviors Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs. Code which relies heavily on sleeps is prone to race conditions, so first check for calls to sleep in the affected code. Adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events. This can be useful for reproducing the behavior, seeing if you can make it disappear by changing the timing of things, and for testing solutions put in place. The sleeps should be removed after debugging. The signature sign that one has a race condition though, is if there's an issue that only occurs intermittently on some machines. Common bugs would be crashes and deadlocks. With logging, you should be able to find the affected area and work back from there.","A race condition occurs in multi-threaded or multi-process systems when the outcome depends on the relative timing of events, without proper synchronization. This can happen when threads access shared resources without ensuring a specific order of operations. Common signs of a race condition include intermittent issues on some machines, crashes, and deadlocks, often accompanied by the use of sleeps in the code.

34510,What is a race condition?,"A ""race condition"" exists when multithreaded (or otherwise parallel) code that would access a shared resource could do so in such a way as to cause unexpected results. Take this example: If you had 5 threads executing this code at once, the value of x WOULD NOT end up being 50,000,000. It would in fact vary with each run. This is because, in order for each thread to increment the value of x, they have to do the following: (simplified, obviously) Any thread can be at any step in this process at any time, and they can step on each other when a shared resource is involved. The state of x can be changed by another thread during the time between x is being read and when it is written back. Let's say a thread retrieves the value of x, but hasn't stored it yet. Another thread can also retrieve the same value of x (because no thread has changed it yet) and then they would both be storing the same value (x+1) back in x! Example: Race conditions can be avoided by employing some sort of locking mechanism before the code that accesses the shared resource: Here, the answer comes out as 50,000,000 every time. For more on locking, search for: mutex, semaphore, critical section, shared resource.","A ""race condition"" occurs in multithreaded or parallel code when multiple threads access a shared resource, leading to unexpected results due to overlapping operations.

27581,What issues should be considered when overriding equals and hashCode in Java?,One gotcha I have found is where two objects contain references to each other (one example being a parent/child relationship with a convenience method on the parent to get all children).

3881,IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?,"You should be using <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> (IAE), not <code>NullPointerException</code> (NPE) for the following reasons: First, the NPE JavaDoc explicitly lists the cases where NPE is appropriate. Notice that all of them are thrown by the runtime when <code>null</code> is used inappropriately. In contrast, the IAE JavaDoc couldn't be more clear: ""Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument."" Yup, that's you! Second, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume? Probably that someone dereferenced a <code>null</code>. When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value. Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading. Third, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead? Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE's separately from IAE and do something different as a result? Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message? But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters. Fourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent? Why is it that an illegal <code>null</code> is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments? Finally, I accept the argument given by other answers that parts of the Java API use NPE in this manner.

On most platforms, <code>signed char</code> will be an 8-bit two's complement number ranging from <code>-128</code> to <code>127</code>, and <code>unsigned char</code> will be an 8-bit unsigned integer (<code>0</code> to <code>255</code>).

Here's a summary with examples: 1 - Runtime Configuration Area - <code>global-ignores</code> option: This is a client-side only setting, so your <code>global-ignores</code> list won't be shared by other users, and it applies to all repos you checkout onto your computer. This setting is defined in your Runtime Configuration Area file: Windows (file-based) - <code>C:\Users\{you}\AppData\Roaming\Subversion\config</code> Windows (registry-based) - <code>Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\global-ignores</code> in both <code>HKLM</code> and <code>HKCU</code>. Linux/Unix - <code>~/.subversion/config</code> 2 - The <code>svn:ignore</code> property, which is set on directories (not files): This is stored within the repo, so other users will have the same ignore files. Similar to how <code>.gitignore</code> works. <code>svn:ignore</code> is applied to directories and is non-recursive or inherited. Any file or immediate subdirectory of the parent directory that matches the File Pattern will be excluded. While SVN 1.8 adds the concept of ""inherited properties"", the <code>svn:ignore</code> property itself is ignored in non-immediate descendant directories: (So the file <code>./subdirectory/ignoreThis</code> is not ignored, even though ""<code>ignoreThis.txt</code>"" is applied on the <code>.</code> repo root). Therefore, to apply an ignore list recursively you must use <code>svn propset svn:ignore &lt;filePattern&gt; . --recursive</code>. This will create a copy of the property on every subdirectory. If the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> value is different in a child directory then the child's value completely overrides the parents, so there is no ""additive"" effect. So if you change the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> on the root <code>.</code>, then you must change it with <code>--recursive</code> to overwrite it on the child and descendant directories. I note that the command-line syntax is counter-intuitive. I started-off assuming that you would ignore a file in SVN by typing something like <code>svn ignore pathToFileToIgnore.txt</code> however this is not how SVN's ignore feature works. 3- The <code>svn:global-ignores</code> property. Requires SVN 1.8 (June 2013): This is similar to <code>svn:ignore</code>, except it makes use of SVN 1.8's ""inherited properties"" feature. Compare to <code>svn:ignore</code>, the file pattern is automatically applied in every descendant directory (not just immediate children). This means that is unnecessary to set <code>svn:global-ignores</code> with the <code>--recursive</code> flag, as inherited ignore file patterns are automatically applied as they're inherited. Running the same set of commands as in the previous example, but using <code>svn:global-ignores</code> instead: For TortoiseSVN users: This whole arrangement was confusing for me, because TortoiseSVN's terminology (as used in their Windows Explorer menu system) was initially misleading to me - I was unsure what the significance of the Ignore menu's ""Add  recursively"", ""Add *"" and ""Add "" options. I hope this post explains how the Ignore feature ties-in to the SVN Properties feature. That said, I suggest using the command-line to set ignored files so you get a feel for how it works instead of using the GUI, and only using the GUI to manipulate properties after you're comfortable with the command-line. Listing files that are ignored: The command <code>svn status</code> will hide ignored files (that is, files that match an RGA <code>global-ignores</code> pattern, or match an immediate parent directory's <code>svn:ignore</code> pattern or match any ancesor directory's <code>svn:global-ignores</code> pattern. Use the <code>--no-ignore</code> option to see those files listed. Ignored files have a status of <code>I</code>, then pipe the output to <code>grep</code> to only show lines starting with ""I"". The command is: For example: ta-da!","To ignore files in Subversion (SVN), you can use one of three methods: 

1. **Runtime Configuration Area**: Set the `global-ignores` option in your SVN client's configuration file, which applies to all repositories on your computer. 
2. **svn:ignore property**: Set this property on a directory to ignore files within it. This is stored in the repository and applies to all users. The property is non-recursive, but can be applied recursively using the `--recursive` flag.
3. **svn:global-ignores property**: Similar to `svn:ignore`, but uses SVN 1","Marking files as ignored: This setting is defined in your Runtime Configuration Area file: Running the same set of commands as in the previous example, but using <code>svn:global-ignores</code> instead:","Subversion, as of version 1.8 (June 2013) and later, supports 3 different ways of specifying file patterns.

93539,What is the difference between Views and Materialized Views in Oracle?,"Views evaluate the data in the tables underlying the view definition at the time the view is queried. It is a logical view of your tables, with no data stored anywhere else. The upside of a view is that it will always return the latest data to you. The downside of a view is that its performance depends on how good a select statement the view is based on. If the select statement used by the view joins many tables, or uses joins based on non-indexed columns, the view could perform poorly. Materialized views are similar to regular views, in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement), however, the underlying query resultset has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view, you are querying a table, which may also be indexed. In addition, because all the joins have been resolved at materialized view refresh time, you pay the price of the join once (or as often as you refresh your materialized view), rather than each time you select from the materialized view. In addition, with query rewrite enabled, Oracle can optimize a query that selects from the source of your materialized view in such a way that it instead reads from your materialized view. In situations where you create materialized views as forms of aggregate tables, or as copies of frequently executed queries, this can greatly speed up the response time of your end user application. The downside though is that the data you get back from the materialized view is only as up to date as the last time the materialized view has been refreshed. Materialized views can be set to refresh manually, on a set schedule, or based on the database detecting a change in data from one of the underlying tables. Materialized views can be incrementally updated by combining them with materialized view logs, which act as change data capture sources on the underlying tables. Materialized views are most often used in data warehousing / business intelligence applications where querying large fact tables with thousands of millions of rows would result in query response times that resulted in an unusable application.","The main difference between Views and Materialized Views in Oracle is how they store and retrieve data. 

**Views**:
- Evaluate data in real-time from underlying tables.
- Always return the latest data.
- Performance depends on the complexity of the underlying select statement.
- No data is stored, so it's a logical view.

**Materialized Views**:
- Store the result of a query in a physical table.
- Return data that is as up-to-date as the last refresh.
- Can improve performance by reducing the need for complex joins and allowing indexing.
- Can be refreshed manually, on a schedule, or based on data changes",,"Views evaluate the data in the tables underlying the view definition at the time the view is queried.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Inversion of control is a pattern used for decoupling components and layers in the system. The pattern is implemented through injecting dependencies into a component when it is constructed. These dependences are usually provided as interfaces for further decoupling and to support testability. IoC / DI containers such as Castle Windsor, Unity are tools (libraries) which can be used for providing IoC. These tools provide extended features above and beyond simple dependency management, including lifetime, AOP / Interception, policy, etc. a. Alleviates a component from being responsible for managing it's dependencies. b. Provides the ability to swap dependency implementations in different environments. c. Allows a component be tested through mocking of dependencies. d. Provides a mechanism for sharing resources throughout an application. a. Critical when doing test-driven development. Without IoC it can be difficult to test, because the components under test are highly coupled to the rest of the system. b. Critical when developing modular systems.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"So number 1 above. What is Inversion of Control? Maintenance is the number one thing it solves for me. It guarantees I am using interfaces so that two classes are not intimate with each other. In using a container like Castle Windsor, it solves maintenance issues even better. Being able to swap out a component that goes to a database for one that uses file based persistence without changing a line of code is awesome (configuration change, you're done). And once you get into generics, it gets even better. Imagine having a message publisher that receives records and publishes messages. It doesn't care what it publishes, but it needs a mapper to take something from a record to a message. I wrote it once, but now I can inject many types into this set of code if I publish different types of messages. I can also write mappers that take a record of the same type and map them to different messages. Using DI with Generics has given me the ability to write very little code to accomplish many tasks. Oh yeah, there are testability concerns, but they are secondary to the benefits of IoC/DI. I am definitely loving IoC/DI. 3 .

100003,What are metaclasses in Python?,"<em>Note, this answer is for Python 2.x as it was written in 2008, metaclasses are slightly different in 3.x, see the comments.</em> Metaclasses are the secret sauce that make 'class' work. The default metaclass for a new style object is called 'type'. Metaclasses take 3 args. '<strong>name</strong>', '<strong>bases</strong>' and '<strong>dict</strong>' Here is where the secret starts. Look for where name, bases and the dict come from in this example class definition. Lets define a metaclass that will demonstrate how '<strong>class:</strong>' calls it. And now, an example that actually means something, this will automatically make the variables in the list ""attributes"" set on the class, and set to None. Note that the magic behaviour that 'Initalised' gains by having the metaclass <code>init_attributes</code> is not passed onto a subclass of Initalised. Here is an even more concrete example, showing how you can subclass 'type' to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created. This is quite tricky:","Metaclasses in Python are the underlying mechanism that makes the 'class' keyword work. They are classes whose instances are classes, and they take three arguments: 'name', 'bases', and 'dict'. The default metaclass is 'type'.

It can be easily seen that in Python classes need to be first-class objects too to enable this behavior. I've never written one myself, but I think one of the nicest uses of metaclasses can be seen in the Django framework.

100003,What are metaclasses in Python?,"A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves, a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows), the more useful approach is actually to make it an actual class itself. <code>type</code> is the usual metaclass in Python. In case you're wondering, yes, <code>type</code> is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won't be able to recreate something like <code>type</code> purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass <code>type</code>. A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. Like you create an instance of the class by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the 'class' statement) by calling the metaclass. Combined with the normal <code>__init__</code> and <code>__new__</code> methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to do 'extra things' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry, or even replace the class with something else entirely. When the <code>class</code> statement is executed, Python first executes the body of the <code>class</code> statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the <code>__metaclass__</code> attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the <code>__metaclass__</code> global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name, bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it. However, metaclasses actually define the <em>type</em> of a class, not just a factory for it, so you can do much more with them. You can, for instance, define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods, in that they can be called on the class without an instance, but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. <code>type.__subclasses__()</code> is an example of a method on the <code>type</code> metaclass. You can also define the normal 'magic' methods, like <code>__add__</code>, <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__getattr__</code>, to implement or change how the class behaves. Here's an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:","**Metaclasses in Python:**

A metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. It defines how a class behaves, similar to how a class defines how its instances behave. The `type` class is the default metaclass in Python. To create a custom metaclass, you can subclass `type`.

**Key aspects of metaclasses:**

1. **Class factory**: Metaclasses are used to create new classes.
2. **Inheritance**: Metaclasses are inherited from parent classes.
3. **Customization**: Metaclasses can be used to register new classes, replace classes, or add custom behavior.","A metaclass is the class of a class.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Model-View-Presenter In MVP, the Presenter contains the UI business logic for the View. All invocations from the View delegate directly to Presenter. The Presenter is also decoupled directly from the View and talks to it through an interface. This is to allow mocking of the View in a unit test. One common attribute of MVP is that there has to be a lot of two-way dispatching. For example, when someone clicks the ""Save"" button, the event handler delegates to the Presenter's ""OnSave"" method. Once the save is completed, the Presenter will then call back the View through its interface so that the View can display that the save has completed. MVP tends to be a very natural pattern for achieving separated presentation in Web Forms. The reason is that the View is always created first by the ASP.NET runtime. You can find out more about both variants. Two primary variations Passive View: The View is as dumb as possible and contains almost zero logic. The Presenter is a middle man that talks to the View and the Model. The View and Model are completely shielded from one another. The Model may raise events, but the Presenter subscribes to them for updating the View. In Passive View there is no direct data binding, instead the View exposes setter properties which the Presenter uses to set the data. All state is managed in the Presenter and not the View. Pro: maximum testability surface; clean separation of the View and Model Con: more work (for example all the setter properties) as you are doing all the data binding yourself. Supervising Controller: The Presenter handles user gestures. The View binds to the Model directly through data binding. In this case it's the Presenter's job to pass off the Model to the View so that it can bind to it. The Presenter will also contain logic for gestures like pressing a button, navigation, etc. Pro: by leveraging databinding the amount of code is reduced. Con: there's less testable surface (because of data binding), and there's less encapsulation in the View since it talks directly to the Model. Model-View-Controller In the MVC, the Controller is responsible for determining which View to display in response to any action including when the application loads. This differs from MVP where actions route through the View to the Presenter. In MVC, every action in the View correlates with a call to a Controller along with an action. In the web each action involves a call to a URL on the other side of which there is a Controller who responds. Once that Controller has completed its processing, it will return the correct View. The sequence continues in that manner throughout the life of the application: One other big difference about MVC is that the View does not directly bind to the Model. The view simply renders, and is completely stateless. In implementations of MVC the View usually will not have any logic in the code behind. This is contrary to MVP where it is absolutely necessary because, if the View does not delegate to the Presenter, it will never get called. Presentation Model One other pattern to look at is the Presentation Model pattern. In this pattern there is no Presenter. Instead the View binds directly to a Presentation Model. The Presentation Model is a Model crafted specifically for the View. This means this Model can expose properties that one would never put on a domain model as it would be a violation of separation-of-concerns. In this case, the Presentation Model binds to the domain model, and may subscribe to events coming from that Model. The View then subscribes to events coming from the Presentation Model and updates itself accordingly. The Presentation Model can expose commands which the view uses for invoking actions. The advantage of this approach is that you can essentially remove the code-behind altogether as the PM completely encapsulates all of the behaviour for the view. This pattern is a very strong candidate for use in WPF applications and is also called Model-View-ViewModel. There is a MSDN article about the Presentation Model and a section in the Composite Application Guidance for WPF (former Prism) about Separated Presentation Patterns","**MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are two software architectural patterns used for separating presentation logic from business logic.**

**MVP:**

* The Presenter contains UI business logic and acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model.
* The View delegates to the Presenter, which then updates the View through an interface.
* Two variations: Passive View (View has no logic, Presenter manages state) and Supervising Controller (View binds to Model directly, Presenter handles gestures).

**MVC:**

Smart pointers typically keep track of   the objects that point to them for the   purpose of memory management.

106508,What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?,"A smart pointer is a class that wraps a 'raw' (or 'bare') C++ pointer, to manage the lifetime of the object being pointed to. There is no single smart pointer type, but all of them try to abstract a raw pointer in a practical way. Smart pointers should be preferred over raw pointers. If you feel you need to use pointers (first consider if you really do), you would normally want to use a smart pointer as this can alleviate many of the problems with raw pointers, mainly forgetting to delete the object and leaking memory. With raw pointers, the programmer has to explicitly destroy the object when it is no longer useful. A smart pointer by comparison defines a policy as to when the object is destroyed. You still have to create the object, but you no longer have to worry about destroying it. The simplest policy in use involves the scope of the smart pointer wrapper object, such as implemented by <code>boost::scoped_ptr</code> or <code>std::unique_ptr</code>. Note that <code>scoped_ptr</code> instances cannot be copied. This prevents the pointer from being deleted multiple times (incorrectly). You can, however, pass references to it around to other functions you call. Scoped pointers are useful when you want to tie the lifetime of the object to a particular block of code, or if you embedded it as member data inside another object, the lifetime of that other object. The object exists until the containing block of code is exited, or until the containing object is itself destroyed. A more complex smart pointer policy involves reference counting the pointer. This does allow the pointer to be copied. When the last ""reference"" to the object is destroyed, the object is deleted. This policy is implemented by <code>boost::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code>. Reference counted pointers are very useful when the lifetime of your object is much more complicated, and is not tied directly to a particular section of code or to another object. There is one drawback to reference counted pointers Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?the possibility of creating a dangling reference: Another possibility is creating circular references: To work around this problem, both Boost and C++11 have defined a <code>weak_ptr</code> to define a weak (uncounted) reference to a <code>shared_ptr</code>. UPDATE This answer is rather old, and so describes what was 'good' at the time, which was smart pointers provided by the Boost library. Since C++11, the standard library has provided sufficient smart pointers types, and so you should favour the use of <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, <code>std::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::weak_ptr</code>.

109023,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"This is known as the 'Hamming Weight', 'popcount' or 'sideways addition'. The 'best' algorithm really depends on which CPU you are on and what your usage pattern is. Some CPUs have a single built-in instruction to do it and others have parallel instructions which act on bit vectors. The parallel instructions (like x86's <code>popcnt</code>, on CPUs where it's supported) will almost certainly be fastest. Some other architectures may have a slow instruction implemented with a microcoded loop that tests a bit per cycle (citation needed). A pre-populated table lookup method can be very fast if your CPU has a large cache and/or you are doing lots of these instructions in a tight loop. However it can suffer because of the expense of a 'cache miss', where the CPU has to fetch some of the table from main memory. If you know that your bytes will be mostly 0's or mostly 1's then there are very efficient algorithms for these scenarios. I believe a very good general purpose algorithm is the following, known as 'parallel' or 'variable-precision SWAR algorithm'. I have expressed this in a C-like pseudo language, you may need to adjust it to work for a particular language (e.g. using uint32_t for C++ and >>> in Java): This has the best worst-case behaviour of any of the algorithms discussed, so will efficiently deal with any usage pattern or values you throw at it. This bitwise-SWAR algorithm could parallelize to be done in multiple vector elements at once, instead of in a single integer register, for a speedup on CPUs with SIMD but no usable popcount instruction. (e.g. x86-64 code that has to run on any CPU, not just Nehalem or later.) However, the best way to use vector instructions for popcount is usually by using a variable-shuffle to do a table-lookup for 4 bits at a time of each byte in parallel. (The 4 bits index a 16 entry table held in a vector register). On Intel CPUs, the hardware 64bit popcnt instruction can outperform an SSSE3 <code>PSHUFB</code> bit-parallel implementation by about a factor of 2, but only if your compiler gets it just right. Otherwise SSE can come out significantly ahead. Newer compiler versions are aware of the popcnt false dependency problem on Intel.

On the GNU compiler for example you can just use: In the worst case the compiler will generate a call to a function. In the best case the compiler will emit a cpu instruction to do the same job faster. The GCC intrinsics even work across multiple platforms. Popcount will become mainstream in the x86 architecture, so it makes sense to start using the intrinsic now. Other architectures have the popcount for years. On x86, you can tell the compiler that it can assume support for <code>popcnt</code> instruction with <code>-mpopcnt</code> or <code>-msse4.2</code> to also enable the vector instructions that were added in the same generation. See GCC x86 options. <code>-march=nehalem</code> (or <code>-march=</code> whatever CPU you want your code to assume and to tune for) could be a good choice. Running the resulting binary on an older CPU will result in an illegal-instruction fault. To make binaries optimized for the machine you build them on, use <code>-march=native</code>  (with gcc, clang, or ICC). MSVC provides an intrinsic for the x86 <code>popcnt</code> instruction, but unlike gcc it's really an intrinsic for the hardware instruction and requires hardware support. Using <code>std::bitset&lt;&gt;::count()</code> instead of a built-in In theory, any compiler that knows how to popcount efficiently for the target CPU should expose that functionality through ISO C++ <code>std::bitset&lt;&gt;</code>. In practice, you might be better off with the bit-hack AND/shift/ADD in some cases for some target CPUs. For target architectures where hardware popcount is an optional extension (like x86), not all compilers have a <code>std::bitset</code> that takes advantage of it when available. For example, MSVC has no way to enable <code>popcnt</code> support at compile time, and always uses a table lookup, even with <code>/Ox /arch:AVX</code> (which implies SSE4.2, although technically there is a separate feature bit for <code>popcnt</code>.) But at least you get something portable that works everywhere, and with gcc/clang with the right target options, you get hardware popcount for architectures that support it. See asm from gcc, clang, icc, and MSVC on the Godbolt compiler explorer. x86-64 <code>gcc -O3 -std=gnu++11 -mpopcnt</code> emits this: PowerPC64 <code>gcc -O3 -std=gnu++11</code> emits (for the <code>int</code> arg version): This source isn't x86-specific or GNU-specific at all, but only compiles well for x86 with gcc/clang/icc. Also note that gcc's fallback for architectures without single-instruction popcount is a byte-at-a-time table lookup. This isn't wonderful for ARM, for example.","To count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer, consider using built-in compiler functions. For the GNU compiler, the `popcount` intrinsic can be used, which may generate a CPU instruction for faster execution. This intrinsic is also available on other architectures. Alternatively, `std::bitset<>::count()` can be used, but its efficiency may vary depending on the target CPU.

**Answer:** The best way to filter a Java Collection is by using Java 8's Stream API, specifically the `filter()` method. This method allows you to pass a predicate (a function that returns a boolean value) to filter the elements of the collection.
**The setup:** To use the `filter()` method, you need to create a Stream from your collection, apply the `filter()` method with your predicate, and then collect the results into a new collection.

This is a slight variation on Jon's comments. First add this interface to your codebase. Its implementers can answer when a certain predicate is true of a certain type. E.g. If <code>T</code> were <code>User</code> and <code>AuthorizedUserPredicate&lt;User&gt;</code> implements <code>IPredicate&lt;T&gt;</code>, then <code>AuthorizedUserPredicate#apply</code> returns whether the passed in <code>User</code> is authorized. Then in some utility class, you could say So, assuming that you have the use of the above might be If performance on the linear check is of concern, then I might want to have a domain object that has the target collection. The domain object that has the target collection would have filtering logic for the methods that initialize, add and set the target collection. UPDATE: In the utility class (let's say Predicate), I have added a select method with an option for default value when the predicate doesn't return the expected value, and also a static property for params to be used inside the new IPredicate. The following example looks for missing objects between collections: The following example, looks for an instance in a collection, and returns the first element of the collection as default value when the instance is not found: UPDATE (after Java 8 release): It's been several years since I (Alan) first posted this answer, and I still cannot believe I am collecting SO points for this answer. At any rate, now that Java 8 has introduced closures to the language, my answer would now be considerably different, and simpler. With Java 8, there is no need for a distinct static utility class. So if you want to find the 1st element that matches your predicate. The JDK 8 API for optionals has the ability to <code>get()</code>, <code>isPresent()</code>, <code>orElse(defaultUser)</code>, <code>orElseGet(userSupplier)</code> and <code>orElseThrow(exceptionSupplier)</code>, as well as other 'monadic' functions such as <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code> and <code>filter</code>. If you want to simply collect all the users which match the predicate, then use the <code>Collectors</code> to terminate the stream in the desired collection. See here for more examples on how Java 8 streams work.","To filter a Java Collection, you can use the following approaches:

**Before Java 8:**

1. Create an `IPredicate` interface with an `apply` method that checks if a certain condition is true for an object.
2. Create a utility class with a `select` method that uses the `IPredicate` to filter a collection.
3. Use a domain object to encapsulate the filtering logic for the target collection.

1. Use Java 8's built-in functional programming features, such as lambda expressions and the `Stream` API.

1. **Ownership**: A mutex is owned by a thread until it is unlocked, whereas a binary semaphore does not have ownership and can be signaled by any task.

Most web applications are fine with dirty reads - on the rare occasion the data doesn't exactly tally the next reload does. For exact data operations (like in many financial transactions) use pessimistic. It's essential that the data is accurately read, with no un-shown changes - the extra locking overhead is worth it.

It costs less to do a normal operation but if the collision DOES occur you would pay a higher price to resolve it as the transaction is aborted. Pessimistic locking is used when a collision is anticipated. The transactions which would violate synchronization are simply blocked.

129329,Optimistic vs. Pessimistic locking,"Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, take note of a version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or checksums/hashes) and check that the version hasn't changed before you write the record back. When you write the record back you filter the update on the version to make sure it's atomic. (i.e. hasn't been updated between when you check the version and write the record to the disk) and update the version in one hit. If the record is dirty (i.e. different version to yours) you abort the transaction and the user can re-start it. This strategy is most applicable to high-volume systems and three-tier architectures where you do not necessarily maintain a connection to the database for your session. In this situation the client cannot actually maintain database locks as the connections are taken from a pool and you may not be using the same connection from one access to the next. Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it. It has much better integrity than optimistic locking but requires you to be careful with your application design to avoid Deadlocks. To use pessimistic locking you need either a direct connection to the database (as would typically be the case in a two tier client server application) or an externally available transaction ID that can be used independently of the connection. In the latter case you open the transaction with the TxID and then reconnect using that ID. The DBMS maintains the locks and allows you to pick the session back up through the TxID. This is how distributed transactions using two-phase commit protocols (such as XA or COM+ Transactions) work.","Here's a summary:

**Optimistic Locking:**

* Read a record and note its version number
* Check the version before writing the record back
* Update the record and version in one atomic operation
* If the record has changed, abort the transaction and restart
* Suitable for high-volume systems and three-tier architectures with pooled connections

* Lock a record exclusively until finished with it

Incidentally, throwing a <code>std::string</code> isn't the best approach to begin with. You'll have a lot more flexibility down the road if you use a simple wrapper object. It may just encapsulate a <code>string</code> for now, but maybe in future you will want to include other information, like some data which caused the exception or maybe a line number (very common, that). You don't want to change all of your exception handling in every spot in your code-base, so take the high road now and don't throw raw objects.","Throwing a `std::string` as an exception in C++ works, but it's not recommended due to potential memory leaks and limited flexibility.

141525,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"Let's say we have a single byte: Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte. The bits don't rollover; they are discarded. That means if you left shift 1101100 and then right shift it, you won't get the same result back. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N. Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2N and rounding to zero. Bitshifting can be used for insanely fast multiplication and division, provided you are working with a power of 2. Almost all low-level graphics routines use bitshifting. For example, way back in the olden days, we used mode 13h (320x200 256 colors) for games. In Mode 13h, the video memory was laid out sequentially per pixel. That meant to calculate the location for a pixel, you would use the following math: Now, back in that day and age, speed was critical, so we would use bitshifts to do this operation. However, 320 is not a power of two, so to get around this we have to find out what is a power of two that added together makes 320: Now we can convert that into left shifts: For a final result of: Now we get the same offset as before, except instead of an expensive multiplication operation, we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this (note, it's been forever since I've done assembly (editor's note: corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example)): Total: 28 cycles on whatever ancient CPU had these timings. Vrs 12 cycles on the same ancient CPU. Yes, we would work this hard to shave off 16 CPU cycles. In 32 or 64-bit mode, both versions get a lot shorter and faster. Modern out-of-order execution CPUs like Intel Skylake (see http://agner.org/optimize/) have very fast hardware multiply (low latency and high throughput), so the gain is much smaller. AMD Bulldozer-family is a bit slower, especially for 64-bit multiply. On Intel CPUs, and AMD Ryzen, two shifts are slightly lower latency but more instructions than a multiply (which may lead to lower throughput): vs. Compilers will do this for you: See how gcc, clang, and MSVC all use shift+lea when optimizing <code>return 320*row + col;</code>. The most interesting thing to note here is that x86 has a shift-and-add instruction (<code>LEA</code>) that can do small left shifts and add at the same time, with the performance as and <code>add</code> instruction. ARM is even more powerful: one operand of any instruction can be left or right shifted for free. So scaling by a compile-time-constant that's known to be a power-of-2 can be even more efficient than a multiply. OK, back in the modern days... something more useful now would be to use bitshifting to store two 8-bit values in a 16-bit integer. For example, in C#: In C++, compilers should do this for you if you used a <code>struct</code> with two 8-bit members, but in practice don't always.","Bitwise shift operators, also known as bit-shift operators, are used to shift the bits of a binary number to the left or right. When shifting left, the leftmost bit is discarded, and a new zero is added to the right. Shifting right discards the rightmost bit, and a new zero is added to the left (in ones' complement). 

Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2^N, and shifting right by N is equivalent to dividing by 2^N and rounding to zero. This property makes bit-shifting useful for fast multiplication and division when working with powers of 2","Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N.

141525,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"The bit shifting operators do exactly what their name implies. They shift bits. Here's a brief (or not-so-brief) introduction to the different shift operators. The Operators <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the left shift operator, and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts. All of these operators can be applied to integer values (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, possibly <code>short</code> and <code>byte</code> or <code>char</code>). In some languages, applying the shift operators to any datatype smaller than <code>int</code> automatically resizes the operand to be an <code>int</code>. Note that <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> is not an operator, because it would be redundant. Also note that C and C++ do not distinguish between the right shift operators. They provide only the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator, and the right-shifting behavior is implementation defined for signed types. Left shift (&lt;&lt;) Integers are stored, in memory, as a series of bits. For example, the number 6 stored as a 32-bit <code>int</code> would be: Shifting this bit pattern to the left one position (<code>6 &lt;&lt; 1</code>) would result in the number 12: As you can see, the digits have shifted to the left by one position, and the last digit on the right is filled with a zero. You might also note that shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2. So <code>6 &lt;&lt; 1</code> is equivalent to <code>6 * 2</code>, and <code>6 &lt;&lt; 3</code> is equivalent to <code>6 * 8</code>. A good optimizing compiler will replace multiplications with shifts when possible. Non-circular shifting Please note that these are <em>not</em> circular shifts. Shifting this value to the left by one position (<code>3,758,096,384 &lt;&lt; 1</code>): results in 3,221,225,472: The digit that gets shifted ""off the end"" is lost. It does not wrap around. Logical right shift (>>>) A logical right shift is the converse to the left shift. Rather than moving bits to the left, they simply move to the right. For example, shifting the number 12: to the right by one position (<code>12 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1</code>) will get back our original 6: So we see that shifting to the right is equivalent to division by powers of 2. Lost bits are gone However, a shift cannot reclaim ""lost"" bits. For example, if we shift this pattern: to the left 4 positions (<code>939,524,102 &lt;&lt; 4</code>), we get 2,147,483,744: and then shifting back (<code>(939,524,102 &lt;&lt; 4) &gt;&gt;&gt; 4</code>) we get 134,217,734: We cannot get back our original value once we have lost bits. Arithmetic right shift (>>) The arithmetic right shift is exactly like the logical right shift, except instead of padding with zero, it pads with the most significant bit. This is because the most significant bit is the <em>sign</em> bit, or the bit that distinguishes positive and negative numbers. By padding with the most significant bit, the arithmetic right shift is sign-preserving. For example, if we interpret this bit pattern as a negative number: we have the number -2,147,483,552. Shifting this to the right 4 positions with the arithmetic shift (-2,147,483,552 >> 4) would give us: or the number -134,217,722. So we see that we have preserved the sign of our negative numbers by using the arithmetic right shift, rather than the logical right shift. And once again, we see that we are performing division by powers of 2.","**Bitwise Shift Operators:**

Bitwise shift operators shift the bits of an integer value to the left or right. There are three types of shift operators:

1. **Left Shift (<<)**: Shifts bits to the left, filling the rightmost bits with zeros. Equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2.
2. **Logical Right Shift (>>>)**: Shifts bits to the right, filling the leftmost bits with zeros. Equivalent to division by powers of 2.
3. **Arithmetic Right Shift (>>)**: Shifts bits to the right, filling the leftmost bits with the most significant bit (","They shift bits. Integers are stored, in memory, as a series of bits.

141525,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming. If you read a specification for a device or even some binary file formats, you will see bytes, words, and dwords, broken up into non-byte aligned bitfields, which contain various values of interest. Accessing these bit-fields for reading/writing is the most common usage. A simple real example in graphics programming is that a 16-bit pixel is represented as follows: To get at the green value you would do this: <strong>Explanation</strong> In order to obtain the value of green ONLY, which starts at offset 5 and ends at 10 (i.e. 6-bits long), you need to use a (bit) mask, which when applied against the entire 16-bit pixel, will yield only the bits we are interested in. The appropriate mask is 0x7E0 which in binary is 0000011111100000 (which is 2016 in decimal). To apply a mask, you use the AND operator (&amp;). After applying the mask, you'll end up with a 16-bit number which is really just a 11-bit number since its MSB is in the 11th bit. Green is actually only 6-bits long, so we need to scale it down using a right shift (11 - 6 = 5), hence the use of 5 as offset (<code>#define GREEN_OFFSET  5</code>). Also common is using bit shifts for fast multiplication and division by powers of 2:","Bitwise shift operators are fundamental to low-level programming, allowing access to non-byte aligned bitfields in devices, file formats, and graphics programming. To extract specific bitfields, a mask is applied using the AND operator, and then a bit shift is used to scale down the result. For example, in a 16-bit pixel, a mask (0x7E0) is used to extract the 6-bit green value, and a right shift (by 5) is applied to scale it down. Bit shifts are also used for fast multiplication and division by powers of 2. Key concepts include:

148747,What is the difference between a framework and a library?,"Actually these terms can mean a lot of different things depending the context they are used. For example, on Mac OS X frameworks are just libraries, packed into a bundle. Within the bundle you will find an actual dynamic library (libWhatever.dylib). The difference between a bare library and the framework on Mac is that a framework can contain multiple different versions of the library. It can contain extra resources (images, localized strings, XML data files, UI objects, etc.) and unless the framework is released to public, it usually contains the necessary .h files you need to use the library. Thus you have everything within a single package you need to use the library in your application (a C/C++/Objective-C library without .h files is pretty useless, unless you write them yourself according to some library documentation), instead of a bunch of files to move around (a Mac bundle is just a directory on the Unix level, but the UI treats it like a single file, pretty much like you have JAR files in Java and when you click it, you usually don't see what's inside, unless you explicitly select to show the content). Wikipedia calls framework a ""buzzword"". It defines a software framework as A software framework is a re-usable  design for a software system (or  subsystem). A software framework may  include support programs, code  libraries, a scripting language, or  other software to help develop and  glue together the different components  of a software project. Various parts  of the framework may be exposed  through an API.. So I'd say a library is just that, ""a library"". It is a collection of objects/functions/methods (depending on your language) and your application ""links"" against it and thus can use the objects/functions/methods. It is basically a file containing re-usable code that can usually be shared among multiple applications (you don't have to write the same code over and over again). A framework can be everything you use in application development. It can be a library, a collection of many libraries, a collection of scripts, or any piece of software you need to create your application. Framework is just a very vague term. Here's an article about some guy regarding the topic ""Library vs. Framework"". I personally think this article is highly arguable. It's not wrong what he's saying there, however, he's just picking out one of the multiple definitions of framework and compares that to the classic definition of library. E.g. he says you need a framework for sub-classing. Really? I can have an object defined in a library, I can link against it, and sub-class it in my code. I don't see how I need a ""framework"" for that. In some way he rather explains how the term framework is used nowadays. It's just a hyped word, as I said before. Some companies release just a normal library (in any sense of a classical library) and call it a ""framework"" because it sounds more fancy.","The terms ""framework"" and ""library"" can have different meanings depending on the context.

Because this function is inherited from Object, it will still be available if you copy an instance of this class into an Object-type variable. Normally, if you call toString() on your class while it is pretending to be an Object, the version of toString which will actually fire is the one defined on Object itself.

Really - there isn't all that much to it, just different words for the same thing. [late addition] In fact, as Brian Neal pointed out in a comment to this question, the C++ standard never uses the term 'method' when refering to member functions. Some people may take that as an indication that C++ isn't really an object-oriented language; however, I prefer to take it as an indication that a pretty smart group of people didn't think there was a particularly strong reason to use a different term.","There is no significant difference between a ""method"" and a ""function"", with ""method"" being the object-oriented term for ""function"".

155609,What's the difference between a method and a function?,"From my understanding a method is any operation which can be performed on a class. It is a general term used in programming. In many languages methods are represented by functions and subroutines. The main distinction that most languages use for these is that functions may return a value back to the caller and a subroutine may not. However many modern languages only have functions, but these can optionally not return any value. For example, lets say you want to describe a cat and you would like that to be able to yawn. You would create a Cat class, with a Yawn method, which would most likely be a function without any return value.","A method refers to any operation that can be performed on a class, while a function is a specific type of method that may return a value to the caller, whereas a subroutine may not.

155609,What's the difference between a method and a function?,"Let's say a function is a block of code (usually with its own scope, and sometimes with its own closure) that may receive some arguments and may also return a result. A method is a function that is owned by an object (in some object oriented systems, it is more correct to say it is owned by a class). Being ""owned"" by a object/class means that you refer to the method through the object/class; for example, in Java if you want to invoke a method ""open()"" owned by an object ""door"" you need to write ""door.open()"". Usually methods also gain some extra attributes describing their behaviour within the object/class, for example: visibility (related to the object oriented concept of encapsulation) which defines from which objects (or classes) the method can be invoked. In many object oriented languages, all ""functions"" belong to some object (or class) and so in these languages there are no functions that are not methods.","The main difference between a method and a function is that a method is a function owned by an object or class, and is invoked through that object/class, whereas a function is a standalone block of code that may receive arguments and return results.

A couple of additional facts: C# is fully object oriented so you cannot create standalone ""functions."" In C# every function is bound to an object and is thus, technically, a ""method."" The kicker is that few people in C# refer to them as ""methods"" - they just use the term ""functions"" because there isn't any real distinction to be made.

171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"The closest equivalent to a destructor in Java is the finalize() method. The big difference to a traditional destructor is that you can't be sure when it'll be called, since that's the responsibility of the garbage collector. I'd strongly recommend carefully reading up on this before using it, since your typical RAIA patterns for file handles and so on won't work reliably with finalize().","Java has a finalize() method that serves as a destructor equivalent, but its timing is unpredictable due to garbage collector control, and its use requires careful consideration.","The big difference to a traditional destructor is that you can't be sure when it'll be called, since that's the responsibility of the garbage collector.",The closest equivalent to a destructor in Java is the finalize() method.
171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"Nope, no destructors here. The reason is that all Java objects are heap allocated and garbage collected. Without explicit deallocation (i.e. C++'s delete operator) there is no sensible way to implement real destructors. Java does support finalizers, but they are meant to be used only as a safeguard for objects holding a handle to native resources like sockets, file handles, window handles, etc. When the garbage collector collects an object without a finalizer it simply marks the memory region as free and that's it. When the object has a finalizer, it's first copied into a temporary location (remember, we're garbage collecting here), then it's enqueued into a waiting-to-be-finalized queue and then a Finalizer thread polls the queue with very low priority and runs the finalizer. When the application exits, the JVM stops without waiting for the pending objects to be finalized, so there practically no guarantees that your finalizers will ever run.","Java does not have destructors like C++ because of its garbage collection mechanism. Instead, it has finalizers, which are used to release native resources and are run by a low-priority thread, but there's no guarantee they'll run before the application exits.",,"Nope, no destructors here. The reason is that all Java objects are heap allocated and garbage collected."
171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"Use of finalize() methods should be avoided. They are not a reliable mechanism for resource clean up and it is possible to cause problems in the garbage collector by abusing them. If you require a deallocation call in your object, say to release resources, use an explicit method call. This convention can be seen in existing APIs (e.g. Closeable, Graphics.dispose(), Widget.dispose()) and is usually called via try/finally. Attempts to use a disposed object should throw a runtime exception (see IllegalStateException). EDIT: I was thinking, if all I did was just   to dereference the data and wait for   the garbage collector to collect them,   wouldn't there be a memory leak if my   user repeatedly entered data and   pressed the reset button? Generally, all you need to do is dereference the objects - at least, this is the way it is supposed to work.

Instead, the `finalize()` method is available but its use is discouraged due to potential issues with the garbage collector. To release resources, an explicit method call, such as `close()` or `dispose()`, should be used, following a try/finally convention. Simply dereferencing objects is usually sufficient for memory management, and the garbage collector will handle the rest.

171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"First, note that since Java is garbage-collected, it is rare to need to do anything about object destruction. Firstly because you don't usually have any managed resources to free, and secondly because you can't predict when or if it will happen, so it's inappropriate for things that you need to occur ""as soon as nobody is using my object any more"". You can be notified after an object has been destroyed using java.lang.ref.PhantomReference (actually, saying it has been destroyed may be slightly inaccurate, but if a phantom reference to it is queued then it's no longer recoverable, which usually amounts to the same thing). A common use is: Separate out the resource(s) in your class that need to be destructed into another helper object (note that if all you're doing is closing a connection, which is a common case, you don't need to write a new class: the connection to be closed would be the ""helper object"" in that case). When you create your main object, create also a PhantomReference to it. Either have this refer to the new helper object, or set up a map from PhantomReference objects to their corresponding helper objects. After the main object is collected, the PhantomReference is queued (or rather it may be queued - like finalizers there is no guarantee it ever will be, for example if the VM exits then it won't wait). Make sure you're processing its queue (either in a special thread or from time to time). Because of the hard reference to the helper object, the helper object has not yet been collected. So do whatever cleanup you like on the helper object, then discard the PhantomReference and the helper will eventually be collected too. There is also finalize(), which looks like a destructor but doesn't behave like one. It's usually not a good option.","Java does not have a traditional destructor like some other languages. Due to its garbage collection, manual object destruction is rarely needed. However, there are alternatives to achieve similar results:

1. **PhantomReference**: Allows notification after an object is no longer recoverable, enabling cleanup of managed resources.
2. **Separate resource objects**: Create a helper object for resources that need destruction and use a PhantomReference to track it.
3. **finalize()**: Although available, it's not recommended due to its unpredictable behavior.

These approaches enable cleanup and resource management in Java, but with limitations and considerations.",,"You can be notified after an object has been destroyed using java.lang.ref.PhantomReference (actually, saying it has been destroyed may be slightly inaccurate, but if a phantom reference to it is queued then it's no longer recoverable, which usually amounts to the same thing).

214741,What is a StackOverflowError?,"If you have a function like: Then foo() will keep calling itself, getting deeper and deeper, and when the space used to keep track of what functions you're in is filled up, you get the stack overflow error.","A StackOverflowError occurs when a function calls itself recursively without terminating, causing the call stack to overflow, resulting in an error when the space used to track function calls is filled up.",,"Then foo() will keep calling itself, getting deeper and deeper, and when the space used to keep track of what functions you're in is filled up, you get the stack overflow error."
214741,What is a StackOverflowError?,"Stack overflow means exactly that: a stack overflows. Usually there's a one stack in the program that contains local-scope variables and addresses where to return when execution of a routine ends. That stack tends to be a fixed memory range somewhere in the memory, therefore it's limited how much it can contain values. If the stack is empty you can't pop, if you do you'll get stack underflow error. If the stack is full you can't push, if you do you'll get stack overflow error. So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion. Some implementations optimize out some forms of recursions. Tail recursion in particular. Tail recursive routines are form of routines where the recursive call appears as a final thing what the routine does. Such routine call gets simply reduced into a jump. Some implementations go so far as implement their own stacks for recursion, therefore they allow the recursion to continue until the system runs out of memory. Easiest thing you could try would be to increase your stack size if you can. If you can't do that though, the second best thing would be to look whether there's something that clearly causes the stack overflow. Try it by printing something before and after the call into routine. This helps you to find out the failing routine.","A StackOverflowError occurs when a program's call stack, which stores local variables and return addresses, reaches its limited memory capacity due to excessive allocation, often caused by deep recursion. This can be resolved by increasing the stack size, if possible, or by identifying and optimizing the problematic code, such as converting recursive functions to iterative ones or using tail recursion optimization.","So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion. Tail recursion in particular.","So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion."

151969,When to use self over $this?,"<code>$this-&gt;</code> is used to refer to a specific instance of a class's variables (member variables) or methods. $derek is now a specific instance of Person.Every Person has a first_name and a last_name, but $derek has a specific first_name and last_name (Derek Martin). Inside the $derek instance, we can refer to those as $this->first_name and $this->last_name ClassName:: is used to refer to that type of class, and its static variables, static methods. If it helps, you can mentally replace the word ""static"" with ""shared"". Because they are shared, they cannot refer to $this, which refers to a specific instance (not shared). Static Variables (i.e. static $db_connection) can be shared among all instances of a type of object. For example, all database objects share a single connection (static $connection). <strong>Static Variables Example:</strong>Pretend we have a database class with a single member variable: static $num_connections;Now, put this in the constructor: Just as objects have constructors, they also have destructors, which are executed when the object dies or is unset: Every time we create a new instance, it will increase our connection counter by one. Every time we destroy or stop using an instance, it will decrease the connection counter by one. In this way, we can monitor the number of instances of the database object we have in use with: Because $num_connections is static (shared), it will reflect the total number of active database objects. You may have seen this technique used to share database connections among all instances of a database class. This is done because creating the database connection takes a long time, so it's best to create just one, and share it (this is called a Singleton Pattern). Static Methods (i.e. public static View::format_phone_number($digits)) can be used WITHOUT first instantiating one of those objects (i.e. They do not internally refer to $this). <strong>Static Method Example:</strong> As you can see, public static function prettyName knows nothing about the object. It's just working with the parameters you pass in, like a normal function that's not part of an object. Why bother, then, if we could just have it not as part of the object? <li>First, attaching functions to objects helps you keep things organized, so you know where to find them. <li>Second, it prevents naming conflicts. In a big project, you're likely to have two developers create getName() functions. If one creates a ClassName1::getName(), and the other creates ClassName2::getName(), it's no problem at all. No conflict. Yay static methods! <strong>SELF::</strong>If you are coding <em>outside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you must call it using the object's name View::format_phone_number($phone_number);If you are coding <em>inside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you can <em>either</em> use the object's name View::format_phone_number($pn), OR you can use the self::format_phone_number($pn)  shortcut The same goes for static variables:<strong>Example:</strong> View::templates_path versus self::templates_path Inside the DB class, if we were referring to a static method of some other object, we would use the object's name:<strong>Example:</strong> Session::getUsersOnline(); But if the DB class wanted to refer to its own static variable, it would just say self:<strong>Example:</strong> self::connection; Hope that helps clear things up :)","The article discusses the use of `$this`, `self`, and `static` in object-oriented programming.

224664,Difference between proxy server and reverse proxy server,"The difference is primarily in deployment. Web forward and reverse proxies all have the same underlying features, they accept requests for HTTP requests in various formats and provide a response, usually by accessing the origin or contact server. Fully featured servers usually have access control, caching, and some link-mapping features. A forward proxy is a proxy that is accessed by configuring the client machine. The client needs protocol support for proxy features (redirection, proxy auth, etc.). The proxy is transparent to the user experience, but not to the application. A reverse proxy is a proxy that is deployed as a web server and behaves like a web server, with the exception that instead of locally composing the content from programs and disk, it forwards the request to an origin server.

All I did was update the instance method to return the next connection from the pool - no other changes required. That would have been far harder if we had NOT been using a singleton. Singletons are just fancy globals Can't argue with that but so are all static fields and methods - anything that is accessed from the class rather than an instance is essentially global and I dont see so much pushback on the use of static fields?

255898,How to iterate over arguments in a Bash script,"Rewrite of a now-deleted answer by VonC. Robert Gamble's succinct answer deals directly with the question. This one amplifies on some issues with filenames containing spaces. See also: ${1:+""$@""} in /bin/sh Basic thesis: <code>""$@""</code> is correct, and <code>$*</code> (unquoted) is almost always wrong. This is because <code>""$@""</code> works fine when arguments contain spaces, and works the same as <code>$*</code> when they don't. In some circumstances, <code>""$*""</code> is OK too, but <code>""$@""</code> usually (but not always) works in the same places. Unquoted, <code>$@</code> and <code>$*</code> are equivalent (and almost always wrong). So, what is the difference between <code>$*</code>, <code>$@</code>, <code>""$*""</code>, and <code>""$@""</code>? They are all related to 'all the arguments to the shell', but they do different things. When unquoted, <code>$*</code> and <code>$@</code> do the same thing. They treat each 'word' (sequence of non-whitespace) as a separate argument. The quoted forms are quite different, though: <code>""$*""</code> treats the argument list as a single space-separated string, whereas <code>""$@""</code> treats the arguments almost exactly as they were when specified on the command line. <code>""$@""</code> expands to nothing at all when there are no positional arguments; <code>""$*""</code> expands to an empty string &mdash; and yes, there's a difference, though it can be hard to perceive it. See more information below, after the introduction of the (non-standard) command <code>al</code>. Secondary thesis: if you need to process arguments with spaces and then pass them on to other commands, then you sometimes need non-standard tools to assist. (Or you should use arrays, carefully: <code>""${array[@]}""</code> behaves analogously to <code>""$@""</code>.) Example: Why doesn't that work? It doesn't work because the shell processes quotes before it expands variables. So, to get the shell to pay attention to the quotes embedded in <code>$var</code>, you have to use <code>eval</code>: This gets really tricky when you have file names such as "" "" (with quotes and double quotes and spaces). The shells (all of them) do not make it particularly easy to handle such stuff, so (funnily enough) many Unix programs do not do a good job of handling them. On Unix, a filename (single component) can contain any characters except slash and NUL <code>'\0'</code>. However, the shells strongly encourage no spaces or newlines or tabs anywhere in a path names. It is also why standard Unix file names do not contain spaces, etc. When dealing with file names that may contain spaces and other troublesome characters, you have to be extremely careful, and I found long ago that I needed a program that is not standard on Unix. I call it <code>escape</code> (version 1.1 was dated 1989-08-23T16:01:45Z). Here is an example of <code>escape</code> in use - with the SCCS control system. It is a cover script that does both a <code>delta</code> (think check-in) and a <code>get</code> (think check-out). Various arguments, especially <code>-y</code> (the reason why you made the change) would contain blanks and newlines. Note that the script dates from 1992, so it uses back-ticks instead of <code>$(cmd ...)</code> notation and does not use <code>#!/bin/sh</code> on the first line. (I would probably not use escape quite so thoroughly these days - it is not needed with the <code>-e</code> argument, for example - but overall, this is one of my simpler scripts using <code>escape</code>.) The <code>escape</code> program simply outputs its arguments, rather like <code>echo</code> does, but it ensures that the arguments are protected for use with <code>eval</code> (one level of <code>eval</code>; I do have a program which did remote shell execution, and that needed to escape the output of <code>escape</code>). I have another program called <code>al</code> that lists its arguments one per line (and it is even more ancient: version 1.1 dated 1987-01-27T14:35:49). It is most useful when debugging scripts, as it can be plugged into a command line to see what arguments are actually passed to the command. [Added: And now to show the difference between the various <code>""$@""</code> notations, here is one more example: Notice that nothing preserves the original blanks between the <code>*</code> and <code>*/*</code> on the command line. Also, note that you can change the 'command line arguments' in the shell by using: This sets 4 options, '<code>-new</code>', '<code>-opt</code>', '<code>and</code>', and '<code>arg with space</code>'. ] Hmm, that's quite a long answer - perhaps exegesis is the better term. Source code for <code>escape</code> available on request (email to firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com). The source code for <code>al</code> is incredibly simple: That's all. It is equivalent to the <code>test.sh</code> script that Robert Gamble showed, and could be written as a shell function (but shell functions didn't exist in the local version of Bourne shell when I first wrote <code>al</code>). Also note that you can write <code>al</code> as a simple shell script: The conditional is needed so that it produces no output when passed no arguments. The <code>printf</code> command will produce a blank line with only the format string argument, but the C program produces nothing.","The question is about iterating over arguments in a Bash script. The correct way to do this is by using `""$@""`, which works fine when arguments contain spaces and is equivalent to `$*` when they don't. Unquoted `$@` and `$*` are equivalent and almost always wrong. The difference between `$*`, `$@`, `""*$""`, and `""$@""` is that `""$*""` treats the argument list as a single space-separated string, while `""$@""` treats the arguments almost exactly as they were when specified on the command line.

For example: <em>If you're dealing with an ORM, using <code>o instanceof Person</code> is the only thing that will behave correctly.</em> <strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong> ORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that <code>person.name</code> will be <code>null</code> if <code>person</code> is lazy loaded, even if <code>person.getName()</code> forces loading and returns ""John Doe"". In my experience, this crops up more often in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>. <em>If you're dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>.</em> <strong>Saving an object will change its state</strong> Persistent objects often use a <code>id</code> field to hold the key of the object.

214741,What is a StackOverflowError?,"Parameters and local variables are allocated on the stack (with reference types the object lives on the heap and a variable references that object). The stack typically lives at the upper end of your address space and as it is used up it heads towards the bottom of the address space (i.e. towards zero). Your process also has a heap, which lives at the bottom end of your process. As you allocate memory, this heap can grow towards the upper end of your address space. As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to ""collide"" with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!! ). The common cause for a stack overflow is a bad recursive call. Typically, this is caused when your recursive functions doesn't have the correct termination condition, so it ends up calling itself forever. However, with GUI programming, it's possible to generate indirect recursion. For example, your app may be handling paint messages, and, whilst processing them, it may call a function that causes the system to send another paint message. Here you've not explicitly called yourself, but the OS/VM has done it for you. To deal with them, you'll need to examine your code. If you've got functions that call themselves then check that you've got a terminating condition. If you have, then check that when calling the function you have at least modified one of the arguments, otherwise there'll be no visible change for the recursively called function and the terminating condition is useless. If you've got no obvious recursive functions then check to see if you're calling any library functions that indirectly will cause your function to be called (like the implicit case above).","A StackOverflowError occurs when the stack and heap in a program's address space collide, typically due to excessive recursive function calls without a proper termination condition, causing the stack to overflow.

* **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**: Blocks access to a critical region, allowing only one thread to enter at a time.
* **Binary Semaphore**: Works with a count (0 or 1), indicating availability of a resource, and can be used to control access to a resource.

In summary, Mutex is about blocking a region, while Binary Semaphore is about managing a count to control access.","Mutex work on blocking critical region, But Semaphore work on count.","Mutex work on blocking critical region, But Semaphore work on count."
62814,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"At a theoretical level, they are no different semantically. You can implement a mutex using semaphores or vice versa (see here for an example). In practice, the implementation is different and they offer slightly different services. The practical difference (in terms of the system services surrounding them) is that the implementation of a mutex is aimed at being a more lightweight synchronisation mechanism. In oracle-speak, mutexes are known as latches and semaphores are known as waits. At the lowest level, they use some sort of atomic test and set mechanism. This reads the current value of a memory location, computes some sort of conditional and writes out a value at that location in a single instruction that cannot be interrupted. This means that you can acquire a mutex and test to see if anyone else had it before you. A typical mutex implementation has a process or thread executing the test-and-set instruction and evaluating whether anything else had set the mutex. A key point here is that there is no interaction with the scheduler, so we have no idea (and don't care) who has set the lock. Then we either give up our time slice and attempt it again when the task is re-scheduled or execute a spin-lock. A spin lock is an algorithm like: When we have finished executing our protected code (known as a critical section) we just set the mutex value to zero or whatever means 'clear.' If multiple tasks are attempting to acquire the mutex they the next task that happens to be scheduled after the mutex is released will get access to the resource. Typically you would use mutexes to control a synchronised resource where exclusive access is only needed for very short periods of time, normally to make an update to a shared data structure. A semaphore is a synchronised data structure (typically using a mutex) that has a count and some system call wrappers that interact with the scheduler in a bit more depth than the mutex libraries would. Semaphores are incremented and decremented and used to block tasks until something else is ready. See Producer/Consumer Problem for a simple example of this. Semaphores are initialised to some value - a binary semaphore is just a special case where the semaphore is initialised to 1. Posting to a semaphore has the effect of waking up a waiting process. A basic semaphore algorithm looks like: In the case of a binary semaphore the main practical difference between the two is the nature of the system services surrounding the actual data structure. EDIT: As evan has rightly pointed out, spinlocks will slow down a single processor machine. You would only use a spinlock on a multi-processor box because on a single processor the process holding the mutex will never reset it while another task is running. Spinlocks are only useful on multi-processor architectures.","The main difference between a binary semaphore and a mutex is not theoretical, but practical. Both can be used for synchronization, but they offer different services. A mutex is a lightweight synchronization mechanism, typically used for short periods of exclusive access to a resource, and is often implemented using a spinlock. A semaphore, on the other hand, is a more complex data structure that interacts with the scheduler, allowing tasks to block and wake up when a resource is available. A binary semaphore is a special case of a semaphore, initialized to 1, and is used to control access to a resource. The key differences are:

A typical mutex implementation has a process or thread executing the test-and-set instruction and evaluating whether anything else had set the mutex. A semaphore is a synchronised data structure (typically using a mutex) that has a count and some system call wrappers that interact with the scheduler in a bit more depth than the mutex libraries would.

62814,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"The Toilet example is an enjoyable analogy: Mutex: Is a key to a toilet. One person can   have the key - occupy the toilet - at   the time. When finished, the person   gives (frees) the key to the next   person in the queue. Officially: ""Mutexes are typically   used to serialise access to a section   of  re-entrant code that cannot be   executed concurrently by more than one   thread. A mutex object only allows one   thread into a controlled section,   forcing other threads which attempt to   gain access to that section to wait   until the first thread has exited from   that section."" Ref: Symbian Developer   Library (A mutex is really a semaphore with   value 1.) Semaphore: Is the number of free identical toilet   keys. Example, say we have four   toilets with identical locks and keys.   The semaphore count - the count of   keys - is set to 4 at beginning (all   four toilets are free), then the count   value is decremented as people are   coming in. If all toilets are full,   ie. there are no free keys left, the   semaphore count is 0. Now, when eq.   one person leaves the toilet,   semaphore is increased to 1 (one free   key), and given to the next person in   the queue. Officially: ""A semaphore restricts the   number of simultaneous users of a   shared resource up to a maximum   number. Threads can request access to   the resource (decrementing the   semaphore), and can signal that they   have finished using the resource   (incrementing the semaphore)."" Ref:   Symbian Developer Library","Here is a summary:

**Binary Semaphore vs Mutex:**

* **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**: Allows only one thread to access a resource at a time, like a single key to a toilet. Only one person can occupy the toilet, and when finished, the key is freed for the next person.
* **Semaphore**: Controls the number of threads that can access a resource, like multiple identical keys to toilets. The semaphore count is decremented as threads access the resource and incremented when they finish, allowing a limited number of threads to access the resource simultaneously.

356645,Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.,"It runs successfully the first time,   but if I run it again, I keep getting   a System.OutOfMemoryException. What   are some reasons this could be   happening? Regardless of what the others have said, the error has nothing to do with forgetting to dispose your DBCommand or DBConnection, and you will not fix your error by disposing of either of them. The error has everything to do with your dataset which contains nearly 600,000 rows of data. Apparently your dataset consumes more than 50% of the available memory on your machine. Clearly, you'll run out of memory when you return another dataset of the same size before the first one has been garbage collected. Simple as that. You can remedy this problem in a few ways: Consider returning fewer records. I personally can't imagine a time when returning 600K records has ever been useful to a user. To minimize the records returned, try: Limiting your query to the first 1000 records. If there are more than 1000 results returned from the query, inform the user to narrow their search results. If your users really insist on seeing that much data at once, try paging the data. Remember: Google never shows you all 22 bajillion results of a search at once, it shows you 20 or so records at a time. Google probably doesn't hold all 22 bajillion results in memory at once, it probably finds its more memory efficient to requery its database to generate a new page. If you just need to iterate through the data and you don't need random access, try returning a datareader instead. A datareader only loads one record into memory at a time. If none of those are an option, then you need to force .NET to free up the memory used by the dataset before calling your method using one of these methods: Remove all references to your old dataset. Anything holding on to a refenence of your dataset will prevent it from being reclaimed by memory. If you can't null all the references to your dataset, clear all of the rows from the dataset and any objects bound to those rows instead. This removes references to the datarows and allows them to be eaten by the garbage collector. I don't believe you'll need to call <code>GC.Collect()</code> to force a gen cycle. Not only is it generally a bad idea to call <code>GC.Collect()</code>, because sufficient memory pressure will cause .NET invoke the garbage collector on its own. Note: calling Dispose on your dataset does not free any memory, nor does it invoke the garbage collector, nor does it remove a reference to your dataset. Dispose is used to clean up unmanaged resources, but the DataSet does not have any unmanaged resources. It only implements IDispoable because it inherents from MarshalByValueComponent, so the Dispose method on the dataset is pretty much useless.","The `System.OutOfMemoryException` occurs because the dataset with nearly 600,000 rows consumes over 50% of the available memory, causing the system to run out of memory when trying to return another dataset of the same size. To resolve this issue, consider:

1. Returning fewer records (e.g., limiting to 1000 records).
2. Paging the data (like Google).
3. Using a DataReader, which loads one record at a time.
4. Forcing .NET to free up memory by removing all references to the old dataset or clearing its rows.

224664,Difference between proxy server and reverse proxy server,"The previous answers were accurate, but perhaps too terse. I will try to add some examples. First of all, the word ""proxy"" describes someone or something acting on behalf of someone else. In the computer realm, we are talking about one server acting on the behalf of another computer. For the purposes of accessibility, I will limit my discussion to web proxies - however, the idea of a proxy is not limited to websites. FORWARD proxy Most discussion of web proxies refers to the type of proxy known as a ""forward proxy."" The proxy event, in this case, is that the ""forward proxy"" retrieves data from another web site on behalf of the original requestee. A tale of 3 computers (part I) For an example, I will list three computers connected to the internet. X = your computer, or ""client"" computer on the internet Y = the proxy web site, proxy.example.org Z = the web site you want to visit, www.example.net Normally, one would connect directly from <code>X --&gt; Z.</code> However, in some scenarios, it is better for <code>Y --&gt; Z</code> on behalf of <code>X</code>, which chains as follows: <code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code>. Reasons why X would want to use a forward proxy server: Here is a (very) partial list of uses of a forward proxy server. 1) X is unable to access Z directly because a) Someone with administrative authority over <code>X</code>'s internet connection has decided to block all access to site <code>Z</code>. Examples: The Storm Worm virus is spreading by tricking people into visiting <code>familypostcards2008.com</code>, so the system administrator has blocked access to the site to prevent users from inadvertently infecting themselves. Employees at a large company have been wasting too much time on <code>facebook.com</code>, so management wants access blocked during business hours. A local elementary school disallows internet access to the <code>playboy.com</code> website. A government is unable to control the publishing of news, so it controls access to news instead, by blocking sites such as <code>wikipedia.org</code>. See TOR or FreeNet. b) The administrator of <code>Z</code> has blocked <code>X</code>. Examples: The administrator of Z has noticed hacking attempts coming from X, so the administrator has decided to block X's IP address (and/or netrange). Z is a forum website. <code>X</code> is spamming the forum. Z blocks X. REVERSE proxy A tale of 3 computers (part II) For this example, I will list three computers connected to the internet. X = your computer, or ""client"" computer on the internet Y = the reverse proxy web site, proxy.example.com Z = the web site you want to visit, www.example.net Normally, one would connect directly from <code>X --&gt; Z.</code> However, in some scenarios, it is better for the administrator of <code>Z</code> to restrict or disallow direct access and force visitors to go through Y first. So, as before, we have data being retrieved by <code>Y --&gt; Z</code> on behalf of <code>X</code>, which chains as follows: <code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code>. What is different this time compared to a ""forward proxy,"" is that this time the user <code>X</code> does not know he is accessing <code>Z</code>, because the user <code>X</code> only sees he is communicating with <code>Y</code>. The server <code>Z</code> is invisible to clients and only the reverse proxy <code>Y</code> is visible externally. A reverse proxy requires no (proxy) configuration on the client side. The client <code>X</code> thinks he is only communicating with <code>Y</code> (<code>X --&gt; Y</code>), but the reality is that <code>Y</code> forwarding all communication (<code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code> again). Reasons why Z would want to set up a reverse proxy server: 1) Z wants to force all traffic to its web site to pass through Y first. a) Z has a large web site that millions of people want to see, but a single web server cannot handle all the traffic. So Z sets up many servers and puts a reverse proxy on the internet that will send users to the server closest to them when they try to visit Z. This is part of how the Content Distribution Network (CDN) concept works. Examples: Apple Trailers uses Akamai Jquery.com hosts its javascript files using CloudFront CDN (sample). etc. 2) The administrator of Z is worried about retaliation for content hosted on the server and does not want to expose the main server directly to the public. a) Owners of Spam brands such as ""Canadian Pharmacy"" appear to have thousands of servers, while in reality having most websites hosted on far fewer servers. Additionally, abuse complaints about the spam will only shut down the public servers, not the main server. In the above scenarios, <code>Z</code> has the ability to choose <code>Y</code>.

The client knows it is using a proxy server and configures its settings to use the proxy. The proxy server hides the client's IP address from the server.

An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence. JSON Structure Here is an example of JSON data: JSON in JavaScript JSON (in Javascript) is a string! People often assume all Javascript objects are JSON and that JSON is a Javascript object. This is incorrect. In Javascript <code>var x = {x:y}</code> is not JSON, this is a Javascript object. The two are not the same thing. The JSON equivalent (represented in the Javascript language) would be <code>var x = '{""x"":""y""}'</code>. <code>x</code> is an object of type string not an object in it's own right. To turn this into a fully fledged Javascript object you must first parse it, <code>var x = JSON.parse('{""x"":""y""}');</code>, <code>x</code> is now an object but this is not JSON anymore. See Javascript object Vs JSON When working with JSON and JavaScript, you may be tempted to use the <code>eval</code> function to evaluate the result returned in the callback, but this is not suggested since there are two characters (U+2028 &amp; U+2029) valid in JSON but not in JavaScript (read more of this here). Therefore, one must always try to use Crockford's script that checks for a valid JSON before evaluating it. Link to the script explanation is found here and here is a direct link to the js file. Every major browser nowadays has its own implementation for this. Example on how to use the JSON parser (with the json from the above code snippet): The JSON parser also offers another very useful method, <code>stringify</code>. This method accepts a JavaScript object as a parameter, and outputs back a string with JSON format. This is useful for when you want to send data back to the server: The above two methods (<code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code>) also take a second parameter, which is a function that will be called for every key and value at every level of the final result, and each value will be replaced by result of your inputted function. (More on this here) Btw, for all of you out there who think JSON is just for JavaScript, check out this post that explains and confirms otherwise.

295579,Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer,"I figured out a method that works ~35% faster than your 6bits+Carmack+sqrt code, at least with my CPU (x86) and programming language (C/C++). Your results may vary, especially because I don't know how the Java factor will play out. My approach is threefold: <li>First, filter out obvious answers. This includes negative numbers and looking at the last 4 bits. (I found looking at the last six didn't help.) I also answer yes for 0. (In reading the code below, note that my input is <code>int64 x</code>. )<code>if( x &lt; 0 || (x&2) || ((x & 7) == 5) || ((x & 11) == 8) )    return false;if( x == 0 )    return true;</code> BIGBLOCK <li>Next, check if it's a square modulo 255 = 3 * 5 * 17. Because that's a product of three distinct primes, only about 1/8 of the residues mod 255 are squares. However, in my experience, calling the modulo operator (%) costs more than the benefit one gets, so I use bit tricks involving 255 = 2^8-1 to compute the residue. (For better or worse, I am not using the trick of reading individual bytes out of a word, only bitwise-and and shifts. )<code>int64 y = x;y = (y & 4294967295LL) + (y &gt;&gt; 32); y = (y & 65535) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);y = (y & 255) + ((y &gt;&gt; 8) & 255) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);// At this point, y is between 0 and 511. More code can reduce it farther. BIGBLOCK </code>To actually check if the residue is a square, I look up the answer in a precomputed table.<code>if( bad255[y] )    return false;// However, I just use a table of size 512</code> BIGBLOCK <li>Finally, try to compute the square root using a method similar to Hensel's lemma. (I don't think it's applicable directly, but it works with some modifications.) Before doing that, I divide out all powers of 2 with a binary search:<code>if((x & 4294967295LL) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 32;if((x & 65535) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 16;if((x & 255) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 8;if((x & 15) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 4;if((x & 3) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 2;</code> BIGBLOCK At this point, for our number to be a square, it must be 1 mod 8.<code>if((x & 7) != 1)    return false;</code> BIGBLOCK The basic structure of Hensel's lemma is the following. (Note: untested code; if it doesn't work, try t=2 or 8. )<code>int64 t = 4, r = 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;// Repeat until t is 2^33 or so. Use a loop if you want.</code> BIGBLOCK The idea is that at each iteration, you add one bit onto r, the ""current"" square root of x; each square root is accurate modulo a larger and larger power of 2, namely t/2. At the end, r and t/2-r will be square roots of x modulo t/2. (Note that if r is a square root of x, then so is -r.  This is true even modulo numbers, but beware, modulo some numbers, things can have even more than 2 square roots; notably, this includes powers of 2.) Because our actual square root is less than 2^32, at that point we can actually just check if r or t/2-r are real square roots. In my actual code, I use the following modified loop:<code>int64 r, t, z;r = start[(x &gt;&gt; 3) & 1023];do {    z = x - r * r;    if( z == 0 )        return true;    if( z &lt; 0 )        return false;    t = z & (-z);    r += (z & t) &gt;&gt; 1;    if( r &gt; (t &gt;&gt; 1) )        r = t - r;} while( t &lt;= (1LL &lt;&lt; 33) );</code> BIGBLOCK The speedup here is obtained in three ways: precomputed start value (equivalent to ~10 iterations of the loop), earlier exit of the loop, and skipping some t values. For the last part, I look at <code>z = r - x * x</code>, and set t to be the largest power of 2 dividing z with a bit trick. This allows me to skip t values that wouldn't have affected the value of r anyway. The precomputed start value in my case picks out the ""smallest positive"" square root modulo 8192. Even if this code doesn't work faster for you, I hope you enjoy some of the ideas it contains. Complete, tested code follows, including the precomputed tables. BIGBLOCK","The article discusses a method to quickly determine if the square root of an integer is also an integer. The approach is threefold: 

1. **Filtering**: First, it filters out obvious non-squares, such as negative numbers and numbers with certain last 4 bits. It also immediately returns true for 0.

2. **Modulo check**: Next, it checks if the number is a square modulo 255 by using bit tricks to compute the residue and then looking up the answer in a precomputed table.

Setting a top level layout or control to fill_parent will force it to take up the whole screen. <strong><code>wrap_content</code></strong> Setting a View's size to wrap_content will force it to expand only far enough to contain the values (or child controls) it contains.

75191,What is an unsigned char?,"Because i feel it's really called for, i just want to state some rules of C and C++ (they are the same in this regard). First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object. Second, <code>unsigned char</code> is explicitly stated unsigned. Now, i had a discussion with someone about what happens when you convert the value <code>-1</code> of type int to <code>unsigned char</code>. He refused the idea that the resulting <code>unsigned char</code> has all its bits set to 1, because he was worried about sign representation. But he don't have to. It's immediately following out of this rule that the conversion does what is intended: If the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or   subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type   until the value is in the range of the new type. (<code>6.3.1.3p2</code> in a C99 draft) That's a mathematical description. C++ describes it in terms of modulo calculus, which yields to the same rule. Anyway, what is not guaranteed is that all bits in the integer <code>-1</code> are one before the conversion. So, what do we have so we can claim that the resulting <code>unsigned char</code> has all its <code>CHAR_BIT</code> bits turned to 1? All bits participate in determining its value - that is, no padding bits occur in the object. Adding only one time <code>UCHAR_MAX+1</code> to <code>-1</code> will yield a value in range, namely <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> That's enough, actually! So whenever you want to have an <code>unsigned char</code> having all its bits one, you do It also follows that a conversion is not just truncating higher order bits. The fortunate event for two's complement is that it is just a truncation there, but the same isn't necessarily true for other sign representations.","An `unsigned char` is an unsigned integer type where all bits participate in determining its value, with no padding bits. When converting a negative integer, such as `-1`, to an `unsigned char`, the resulting value will have all its bits set to 1, because the conversion process involves adding or subtracting the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until the value is in range. This is guaranteed by the C and C++ standards, regardless of the sign representation used by the system.

You will need to verify with your particular DBMS help documentation for specifics. As I am most familiar with SQL Server I will use that as my samples. To create a stored procedure the syntax is fairly simple: So for example: A benefit of stored procedures is that you can centralize data access logic into a single place that is then easy for DBA's to optimize. Stored procedures also have a security benefit in that you can grant execute rights to a stored procedure but the user will not need to have read/write permissions on the underlying tables. This is a good first step against SQL injection. Stored procedures do come with downsides, basically the maintenance associated with your basic CRUD operation. Let's say for each table you have an Insert, Update, Delete and at least one select based on the primary key, that means each table will have 4 procedures. Now take a decent size database of 400 tables, and you have 1600 procedures! And that's assuming you don't have duplicates which you probably will.

Now, let's have a look at the following snippet: Since Base's destructor is not <code>virtual</code> and <code>b</code> is a <code>Base*</code> pointing to a <code>Derived</code> object, <code>delete b</code> has undefined behaviour: [In <code>delete b</code>], if the static type of the  object to be deleted is different from its dynamic type, the static  type shall be a base class of the dynamic type of the object to be  deleted and <strong>the static type shall have a virtual destructor or the  behavior is undefined</strong>.

In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. In one sentence: As the size of your job goes up, how much longer does it take to complete it? Obviously that's only using ""size"" as the input and ""time taken"" as the output &mdash; the same idea applies if you want to talk about memory usage etc. Here's an example where we have N T-shirts which we want to dry. We'll <em>assume</em> it's incredibly quick to get them in the drying position (i.e. the human interaction is negligible). That's not the case in real life, of course... <li>Using a washing line outside: assuming you have an infinitely large back yard, washing dries in O(1) time. However much you have of it, it'll get the same sun and fresh air, so the size doesn't affect the drying time. <li>Using a tumble dryer: you put 10 shirts in each load, and then they're done an hour later. (Ignore the actual numbers here &mdash; they're irrelevant.) So drying 50 shirts takes <em>about</em> 5 times as long as drying 10 shirts. <li>Putting everything in an airing cupboard: If we put everything in one big pile and just let general warmth do it, it will take a long time for the middle shirts to get dry. I wouldn't like to guess at the detail, but I suspect this is at least O(N^2) &mdash; as you increase the wash load, the drying time increases faster. One important aspect of ""big O"" notation is that it <em>doesn't</em> say which algorithm will be faster for a given size. Take a hashtable (string key, integer value)  vs an array of pairs (string, integer). Is it faster to find a key in the hashtable or an element in the array, based on a string? (i.e. for the array, ""find the first element where the string part matches the given key."") Hashtables are generally amortised (~= ""on average"") O(1) &mdash; once they're set up, it should take about the same time to find an entry in a 100 entry table as in a 1,000,000 entry table. Finding an element in an array (based on content rather than index) is linear, i.e. O(N) &mdash; on average, you're going to have to look at half the entries. Does this make a hashtable faster than an array for lookups? Not necessarily. If you've got a very small collection of entries, an array may well be faster &mdash; you may be able to check all the strings in the time that it takes to just calculate the hashcode of the one you're looking at. As the data set grows larger, however, the hashtable will eventually beat the array.","Big O notation measures how the time or resources required to complete a task changes as the size of the task increases. It's a way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm, focusing on how it scales.

Big O notation doesn't determine which algorithm is faster for a specific size, but it helps predict how they will perform as",,"In one sentence: As the size of your job goes up, how much longer does it take to complete it?

487258,"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?","Quick note, this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation (which is a two-side bound). In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: The simplest definition I can give for Big-O notation is this: <strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> There are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence: <li><strong>relative:</strong> you can only compare apples to apples. You can't compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers. But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful; <li><strong>representation:</strong> Big-O (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable. That variable is chosen based on observations or assumptions. For example, sorting algorithms are typically compared based on comparison operations (comparing two nodes to determine their relative ordering). This assumes that comparison is expensive. But what if comparison is cheap but swapping is expensive? It changes the comparison; and <li><strong>complexity:</strong> if it takes me one second to sort 10,000 elements how long will it take me to sort one million? Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else. Come back and reread the above when you've read the rest. The best example of Big-O I can think of is doing arithmetic. Take two numbers (123456 and 789012). The basic arithmetic operations we learnt in school were: <li>addition; <li>subtraction; <li>multiplication; and <li>division. Each of these is an operation or a problem. A method of solving these is called an <strong>algorithm</strong>. Addition is the simplest. You line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition in the result. The 'tens' part of that number is carried over to the next column. Let's assume that the addition of these numbers is the most expensive operation in this algorithm. It stands to reason that to add these two numbers together we have to add together 6 digits (and possibly carry a 7th). If we add two 100 digit numbers together we have to do 100 additions. If we add <strong>two</strong> 10,000 digit numbers we have to do 10,000 additions. See the pattern? The <strong>complexity</strong> (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits <em>n</em> in the larger number. We call this <strong>O(n)</strong> or <strong>linear complexity</strong>. Subtraction is similar (except you may need to borrow instead of carry). Multiplication is different. You line the numbers up, take the first digit in the bottom number and multiply it in turn against each digit in the top number and so on through each digit. So to multiply our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplications. We may need to do as many as 10 or 11 column adds to get the end result too. If we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10,000 multiplications and 200 adds. For two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (1012) multiplications and two million adds. As the algorithm scales with n-<em>squared</em>, this is <strong>O(n2)</strong> or <strong>quadratic complexity</strong>. This is a good time to introduce another important concept: <strong>We only care about the most significant portion of complexity.</strong> The astute may have realized that we could express the number of operations as: n2 + 2n. But as you saw from our example with two numbers of a million digits apiece, the second term (2n) becomes insignificant (accounting for 0.0002% of the total operations by that stage). One can notice that we've assumed the worst case scenario here. While multiplying 6 digit numbers if one of them is 4 digit and the other one is 6 digit, then we only have 24 multiplications. Still we calculate the worst case scenario for that 'n', i.e when both are 6 digit numbers. Hence Big-O notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm The Telephone Book The next best example I can think of is the telephone book, normally called the White Pages or similar but it'll vary from country to country. But I'm talking about the one that lists people by surname and then initials or first name, possibly address and then telephone numbers. Now if you were instructing a computer to look up the phone number for ""John Smith"" in a telephone book that contains 1,000,000 names, what would you do? Ignoring the fact that you could guess how far in the S's started (let's assume you can't), what would you do? A typical implementation might be to open up to the middle, take the 500,000th and compare it to ""Smith"". If it happens to be ""Smith, John"", we just got real lucky. Far more likely is that ""John Smith"" will be before or after that name. If it's after we then divide the last half of the phone book in half and repeat. If it's before then we divide the first half of the phone book in half and repeat. And so on. This is called a <strong>binary search</strong> and is used every day in programming whether you realize it or not. So if you want to find a name in a phone book of a million names you can actually find any name by doing this at most 20 times. In comparing search algorithms we decide that this comparison is our 'n'. <li>For a phone book of 3 names it takes 2 comparisons (at most). <li>For 7 it takes at most 3. <li>For 15 it takes 4. <li>For 1,000,000 it takes 20. That is staggeringly good isn't it? In Big-O terms this is <strong>O(log n)</strong> or <strong>logarithmic complexity</strong>. Now the logarithm in question could be ln (base e), log10, log2 or some other base. It doesn't matter it's still O(log n) just like O(2n2) and O(100n2) are still both O(n2). It's worthwhile at this point to explain that Big O can be used to determine three cases with an algorithm: <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> In the telephone book search, the best case is that we find the name in one comparison. This is <strong>O(1)</strong> or <strong>constant complexity</strong>; <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> As discussed above this is O(log n); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> This is also O(log n). Normally we don't care about the best case. We're interested in the expected and worst case. Sometimes one or the other of these will be more important. Back to the telephone book. What if you have a phone number and want to find a name? The police have a reverse phone book but such look-ups are denied to the general public. Or are they? Technically you can reverse look-up a number in an ordinary phone book. How? You start at the first name and compare the number. If it's a match, great, if not, you move on to the next. You have to do it this way because the phone book is <strong>unordered</strong> (by phone number anyway). So to find a name given the phone number (reverse lookup): <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> O(1); <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> O(n) (for 500,000); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> O(n) (for 1,000,000). The Travelling Salesman This is quite a famous problem in computer science and deserves a mention. In this problem you have N towns. Each of those towns is linked to 1 or more other towns by a road of a certain distance. The Travelling Salesman problem is to find the shortest tour that visits every town. Sounds simple? Think again. If you have 3 towns A, B and C with roads between all pairs then you could go: So the Big-O of the Travelling Salesman problem is <strong>O(n! )</strong> or <strong>factorial or combinatorial complexity</strong>. <strong>By the time you get to 200 towns there isn't enough time left in the universe to solve the problem with traditional computers.</strong> Something to think about. Polynomial Time Another point I wanted to make quick mention of is that any algorithm that has a complexity of <strong>O(na)</strong> is said to have <strong>polynomial complexity</strong> or is solvable in <strong>polynomial time</strong>. O(n), O(n2) etc are all polynomial time. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time. Certain things are used in the world because of this. Public Key Cryptography is a prime example. It is computationally hard to find two prime factors of a very large number. If it wasn't, we couldn't use the public key systems we use. Anyway, that's it for my (hopefully plain English) explanation of Big O (revised).","The concept of Big O notation is explained in simple terms. Big O notation is a way to measure the complexity of an algorithm, which is the amount of time or resources it takes to complete as the input size increases.

487258,"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?","<strong>Big O describes the fundamental scaling nature of an algorithm.</strong> There is a lot of information that Big O does not tell you about a given algorithm. It cuts to the bone and gives only information about the scaling nature of an algorithm, specifically how the resource use (think time or memory) of an algorithm scales in response to the ""input size"". Consider the difference between a steam engine and a rocket. They are not merely different varieties of the same thing (as, say, a Prius engine vs. a Lamborghini engine) but they are dramatically different kinds of propulsion systems, at their core. A steam engine may be faster than a toy rocket, but no steam piston engine will be able to achieve the speeds of an orbital launch vehicle. This is because these systems have different scaling characteristics with regards to the relation of fuel required (""resource usage"") to reach a given speed (""input size""). Why is this so important? Because software deals with problems that may differ in size by factors up to a trillion. Consider that for a moment. The ratio between the speed necessary to travel to the Moon and human walking speed is less than 10,000:1, and that is absolutely tiny compared to the range in input sizes software may face. And because software may face an astronomical range in input sizes there is the potential for the Big O complexity of an algorithm, it's fundamental scaling nature, to trump any implementation details. Consider the canonical sorting example. Bubble-sort is O(n2) while merge-sort is O(n log n). Let's say you have two sorting applications, application A which uses bubble-sort and application B which uses merge-sort, and let's say that for input sizes of around 30 elements application A is 1,000x faster than application B at sorting. If you never have to sort much more than 30 elements then it's obvious that you should prefer application A, as it is much faster at these input sizes. However, if you find that you may have to sort ten million items then what you'd expect is that application B actually ends up being thousands of times faster than application A in this case, entirely due to the way each algorithm scales.","**Big O notation** describes how an algorithm's resource usage (time or memory) scales with the size of the input.

I mean, a view is effectively based off of what could be thought of as one or more database views, right? There might be connections between rows in different views. Alternatively, we can talk object-oriented instead of relational, but that actually doesn't change anything -- we still have one or more distinct data entities.

Every object has one, as there is no difference between classes and instances in javascript.

572897,How does JavaScript .prototype work?,"Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]]. If you look up a property via <code>obj.propName</code> or <code>obj['propName']</code> and the object does not have such a property - which can be checked via <code>obj.hasOwnProperty('propName')</code> - the runtime looks up the property in the object referenced by [[Prototype]] instead. If the prototype-object also doesn't have such a property, its prototype is checked in turn, thus walking the original object's prototype-chain until a match is found or its end is reached. Some JavaScript implementations allow direct access to the [[Prototype]] property, eg via a non-standard property named <code>__proto__</code>. In general, it's only possible to set an object's prototype during object creation: If you create a new object via <code>new Func()</code>, the object's [[Prototype]] property will be set to the object referenced by <code>Func.prototype</code>. This allows to simulate classes in JavaScript, although JavaScript's inheritance system is - as we have seen - prototypical, and not class-based: Just think of constructor functions as classes and the properties of the prototype (ie of the object referenced by the constructor function's <code>prototype</code> property) as shared members, ie members which are the same for each instance.

While the references to each object are unique in each array, once you ultimately grab onto it you're dealing with the same object as before. There is nothing wrong with the way you cloned it...  the same result would occur using Array.slice(). The reason your deep copy is having problems is because you're ending up with circular object references. Deep will go as deep as it can go, and if you've got a circle, it'll keep going infinitely until the browser faints. If the data structure cannot be represented as a directed acyclic graph, then I'm not sure you're going to be able to find an all-purpose method for deep cloning. Cyclic graphs provide many tricky corner cases, and since it's not a common operation I doubt anyone has written a full solution (if it's even possible - it might not be! But I have no time to try to write a rigorous proof now.). I found some good comments on the issue on this page. If you need a deep copy of an Array of Objects with circular references I believe you're going to have to code your own method to handle your specialized data structure, such that it is a multi-pass clone: <li>On round one, make a clone of all objects that don't reference other objects in the array. Keep a track of each object's origins. <li>On round two, link the objects together.","To clone an array of objects in JavaScript, a shallow copy can be made using methods like `Array.slice()` or `Array.prototype.slice.call()`, but this will not clone the objects themselves, only the references to them. For a deep copy, where the objects are cloned, a custom method is needed, especially if the data structure contains circular references. This can be achieved through a multi-pass clone approach:

1. **First pass**: Clone objects that don't reference other objects in the array, keeping track of each object's origin.
2. **Second pass**: Link the cloned objects together, handling circular references by using the tracked origins","Keep a track of each object's origins. <li>On round two, link the objects together.","There is nothing wrong with the way you cloned it...  the same result would occur using Array.slice().

597588,How do you clone an Array of Objects in Javascript?,"As Daniel Lew mentioned, cyclic graphs have some problems. If I had this problem I'd either add special <code>clone()</code> methods to the problematic objects or remember which objects I've already copied. I'd do it with a variable <code>copyCount</code> which increases by 1 every time you copy in your code. An object that has a lower <code>copyCount</code> than the current copy-process is copied. If not, the copy, that exists already, should be referenced. This makes it necessary to link from the original to its copy. There is still one problem: Memory. If you have this reference from one object to the other, it's likely that the browser can't free those objects, as they are always referenced from somewhere. You'd have to make a second pass where you set all copy-references to Null. (If you do this, you'd not have to have a <code>copyCount</code> but a boolean <code>isCopied</code> would be enough, as you can reset the value in the second pass.)","To clone an array of objects in JavaScript, especially when dealing with cyclic graphs, you can implement a cloning method that keeps track of already copied objects to avoid infinite loops.

295579,Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer,"The sqrt call is not perfectly accurate, as has been mentioned, but it's interesting and instructive that it doesn't blow away the other answers in terms of speed. After all, the sequence of assembly language instructions for a sqrt is tiny. Intel has a hardware instruction, which isn't used by Java I believe because it doesn't conform to IEEE. So why is it slow? Because Java is actually calling a C routine through JNI, and it's actually slower to do so than to call a Java subroutine, which itself is slower than doing it inline. This is very annoying, and Java should have come up with a better solution, ie building in floating point library calls if necessary. Oh well. In C++, I suspect all the complex alternatives would lose on speed, but I haven't checked them all.What I did, and what Java people will find usefull, is a simple hack, an extension of the special case testing suggested by A. Rex. Use a single long value as a bit array, which isn't bounds checked. That way, you have 64 bit boolean lookup. BIGBLOCK The routine isPerfectSquare5 runs in about 1/3 the time on my core2 duo machine. I suspect that further tweaks along the same lines could reduce the time further on average, but every time you check, you are trading off more testing for more eliminating, so you can't go too much farther on that road. Certainly, rather than having a separate test for negative, you could check the high 6 bits the same way. Note that all I'm doing is eliminating possible squares, but when I have a potential case I have to call the original, inlined isPerfectSquare. The init2 routine is called once to initialize the static values of pp1 and pp2.Note that in my implementation in C++, I'm using unsigned long long, so since you're signed, you'd have to use the >>> operator. There is no intrinsic need to bounds check the array, but Java's optimizer has to figure this stuff out pretty quickly, so I don't blame them for that.","To quickly determine if an integer's square root is an integer, a fast approach is to use a bit array lookup table. This method involves initializing a static array with potential perfect square values and using bitwise operations to eliminate non-square values. This approach can run significantly faster than using the `sqrt` function, especially when implemented in a language like C++ or optimized in Java. The idea is to use a single long value as a bit array to store the lookup table, allowing for 64-bit boolean lookup and reducing the need for bounds checking.

592620,How to check if a program exists from a Bash script?,"Answer POSIX compatible: For <code>bash</code> specific environments: Explanation Avoid <code>which</code>. Not only is it an external process you're launching for doing very little (meaning builtins like <code>hash</code>, <code>type</code> or <code>command</code> are way cheaper), you can also rely on the builtins to actually do what you want, while the effects of external commands can easily vary from system to system. Why care? Many operating systems have a <code>which</code> that doesn't even set an exit status, meaning the <code>if which foo</code> won't even work there and will always report that <code>foo</code> exists, even if it doesn't (note that some POSIX shells appear to do this for <code>hash</code> too). Many operating systems make <code>which</code> do custom and evil stuff like change the output or even hook into the package manager. So, don't use <code>which</code>. Instead use one of these: (Minor side-note: some will suggest <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> is the same <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code> but shorter Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?this is untrue. <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> closes FD 2 which causes an error in the program when it tries to write to stderr, which is very different from successfully writing to it and discarding the output (and dangerous!)) If your hash bang is <code>/bin/sh</code> then you should care about what POSIX says. <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code>'s exit codes aren't terribly well defined by POSIX, and <code>hash</code> is seen to exit successfully when the command doesn't exist (haven't seen this with <code>type</code> yet). <code>command</code>'s exit status is well defined by POSIX, so that one is probably the safest to use. If your script uses <code>bash</code> though, POSIX rules don't really matter anymore and both <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code> become perfectly safe to use. <code>type</code> now has a <code>-P</code> to search just the <code>PATH</code> and <code>hash</code> has the side-effect that the command's location will be hashed (for faster lookup next time you use it), which is usually a good thing since you probably check for its existence in order to actually use it. As a simple example, here's a function that runs <code>gdate</code> if it exists, otherwise <code>date</code>:","To check if a program exists from a Bash script, avoid using the `which` command due to its variability across systems and potential to not set an exit status. Instead, use built-in commands like `hash`, `type`, or `command`. 

- For POSIX-compatible environments, use `command -v` as its exit status is well-defined by POSIX.
- For Bash-specific environments, `type -P` is a good choice as it searches only the PATH, or `hash` which has the benefit of hashing the command's location for faster lookup next time.

310634,"What is the ""right"" way to iterate through an array in Ruby?","I'm not saying that <code>Array</code> -> <code>|value,index|</code> and <code>Hash</code> -> <code>|key,value|</code> is not insane (see Horace Loeb's comment), but I am saying that there is a sane way to expect this arrangement. When I am dealing with arrays, I am focused on the elements in the array (not the index because the index is transitory). The method is each with index, i.e. each+index, or |each,index|, or <code>|value,index|</code>. This is also consistent with the index being viewed as an optional argument, e.g. |value| is equivalent to |value,index=nil| which is consistent with |value,index|. When I am dealing with hashes, I am often more focused on the keys than the values, and I am usually dealing with keys and values in that order, either <code>key =&gt; value</code> or <code>hash[key] = value</code>. If you want duck-typing, then either explicitly use a defined method as Brent Longborough showed, or an implicit method as maxhawkins showed. Ruby is all about accommodating the language to suit the programmer, not about the programmer accommodating to suit the language. This is why there are so many ways.

I would like to iterate backwards: without creating an array (consider 0..1000000000) working for any Range (e.g. Strings, not just Integers) without using any extra object oriented power (i.e. no class modification) I believe this is impossible without defining a <code>pred</code> method, which means modifying the Range class to use it.

Let's break that down. In the simplest case, an enumeration can be declared as This declares an enumeration with the tag <code>tagname</code>. In C and Objective-C (but not C++), any references to this must be preceded with the <code>enum</code> keyword. For example: In order to avoid having to use the <code>enum</code> keyword everywhere, a typedef can be created: This can be simplified into one line: And finally, if we don't need to be able to use <code>enum tagname</code> with the <code>enum</code> keyword, we can make the <code>enum</code> anonymous and only declare it with the typedef name: Now, in this case, we're declaring <code>ShapeType</code> to be a typedef'ed name of an anonymous enumeration. <code>ShapeType</code> is really just an integral type, and should only be used to declare variables which hold one of the values listed in the declaration (that is, one of <code>kCircle</code>, <code>kRectangle</code>, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code>). You can assign a <code>ShapeType</code> variable another value by casting, though, so you have to be careful when reading enum values.

544010,Difference between div id and div class,"Where to use an ID versus a class The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. Therefore, it is appropriate to use an ID on the div element that is marking up the main content on the page, as there will only be one main content section. In contrast, you must use a class to set up alternating row colors on a table, as they are by definition going to be used more than once. IDs are an incredibly powerful tool. An element with an ID can be the target of a piece of JavaScript that manipulates the element or its contents in some way. The ID attribute can be used as the target of an internal link, replacing anchor tags with name attributes. Finally, if you make your IDs clear and logical, they can serve as a sort of Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦Â¸Âelf documentationÃ©Â?within the document.

722651,How do I pass multiple parameters in Objective-C?,"Yes; the Objective-C method syntax is like this for a couple of reasons; one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying are. For example, if you are adding an object to an <code>NSMutableArray</code> at a certain index, you would do it using the method: BIGBLOCK This method is called <code>insertObject:atIndex:</code> and it is clear that an object is being inserted at a specified index. In practice, adding a string ""Hello, World!"" at index 5 of an <code>NSMutableArray</code> called <code>array</code> would be called as follows: BIGBLOCK This also reduces ambiguity between the order of the method parameters, ensuring that you pass the object parameter first, <em>then</em> the index parameter. This becomes more useful when using functions that take a large number of arguments, and reduces error in passing the arguments. Furthermore, the method naming convention is such because Objective-C doesn't support overloading; however, if you want to write a method that does the same job, but takes different data-types, this can be accomplished; take, for instance, the <code>NSNumber</code> class; this has several object creation methods, including: <li><code>+ (id)numberWithBool:(BOOL)value;</code> <li><code>+ (id)numberWithFloat:(float)value;</code> <li><code>+ (id)numberWithDouble:(double)value;</code> In a language such as C++, you would simply overload the number method to allow different data types to be passed as the argument; however, in Objective-C, this syntax allows several different variants of the same function to be implemented, by changing the name of the method for each variant of the function.","In Objective-C, multiple parameters are passed in a method by using a specific syntax that clearly indicates what each parameter represents. This is done to avoid ambiguity and errors when passing arguments, especially when dealing with multiple parameters. The method name is split into parts, with each part describing the corresponding parameter. For example, `insertObject:atIndex:` clearly indicates that an object is being inserted at a specified index.

However, you do have a couple of options: Return a structure that contains multiple members Return an instance of a class Use output parameters (using the out or ref keywords) Use a dictionary or key-value pair as output The pros and cons here are often hard to figure out. If you return a structure, make sure it's small because structs are value type and passed on the stack. If you return an instance of a class, there are some design patterns here that you might want to use to avoid causing problems - members of classes can be modified because C# passes objects by reference (you don't have ByVal like you did in VB). Finally you can use output parameters but I would limit the use of this to scenarios when you only have a couple (like 3 or less) of parameters - otherwise things get ugly and hard to maintain. Also, the use of output parameters can be an inhibitor to agility because your method signature will have to change every time you need to add something to the return value whereas returning a struct or class instance you can add members without modifying the method signature. From an architectural standpoint I would recommend against using key-value pairs or dictionaries. I find this style of coding requires ""secret knowledge"" in code that consumes the method.

761194,Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO),"There are a couple of other differences - Interfaces can't have any concrete implementations. Abstract base classes can. This allows you to provide concrete implementations there. This can allow an abstract base class to actually provide a more rigorous contract, wheras an interface really only describes how a class is used. (The abstract base class can have non-virtual members defining the behavior, which gives more control to the base class author.) More than one interface can be implemented on a class. A class can only derive from a single abstract base class. This allows for polymorphic hierarchy using interfaces, but not abstract base classes. This also allows for a pseudo-multi-inheritance using interfaces. Abstract base classes can be modified in v2+ without breaking the API. Changes to interfaces are breaking changes. [C#/.NET Specific] Interfaces, unlike abstract base classes, can be applied to value types (structs). Structs cannot inherit from abstract base classes.

The answer explains that ""!!"" is not an operator itself, but rather the use of the ""!"" operator twice.

There is no denying that there are some of situations where you do need access to a single instance, and it can be accomplished other ways. I now prefer to design around an inversion of control (IoC) container and allow the the lifetimes to be controlled by the container. This gives you the benefit of the classes that depend on the instance to be unaware of the fact that there is a single instance. The lifetime of the singleton can be changed in the future. Once such example I encountered recently was an easy adjustment from single threaded to multi-threaded. FWIW, if it a PIA when you try to unit test it then it's going to PIA when you try to debug, bug fix or enhance it.","Singletons are problematic due to increased scope and coupling. Instead, using an Inversion of Control (IoC) container allows for more flexibility and control over instance lifetimes, making it easier to modify and test the code, and avoiding issues with unit testing, debugging, and maintenance.",The problems with singletons is the issue of increased scope and therefore coupling.,The problems with singletons is the issue of increased scope and therefore coupling.
137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"Firstly a class and its collaborators should firstly perform their intended purpose rather than focusing on deoendents. Lifecycle management (when instances are creared snd when they go out of scope) should not be part of the cladses responsibility. The accepted best practice for this is to craft or configure a new component to manage dependencies using dependency injection. Often software gets more complicated it makes sense to have multiple independent instances of the ""singleton"" class with different state. Committing code to simply grab the singleton is wrong in such cases. Using Singleton.getInstance() might be ok for small simple systems but it doesn't work / scale when one might need a different instance of the same class. No class should be thought of as a singleton but rather that should be an aplication of it's usage or how it is used to configure dependents. For a quick and nasty this does not matter- just luke hardcoding say file paths does not matter but for bigger applications such dependencies need to be factored out and managed in more appropriate way using DI. The problems that singleton cause in testing is a symptom of their hard coded single usage case/environment. The test suite and the many tests are each individual and separate something that is not compatible with hardcoding a singleton.","Singletons are considered bad practice because they:

* Mix the responsibility of the class with lifecycle management
* Limit flexibility by assuming a single instance, making it difficult to have multiple instances with different states
* Make code less scalable and less suitable for complex systems
* Cause problems in testing due to their hardcoded single usage case
* Should be replaced with dependency injection, which allows for more flexibility and manageability of dependencies.

In essence, singletons are too rigid and inflexible, and can lead to tightly coupled code that is difficult to test and maintain.",The problems that singleton cause in testing is a symptom of their hard coded single usage case/environment.,No class should be thought of as a singleton but rather that should be an aplication of it's usage or how it is used to configure dependents.

I finally realized today that actually these features make the code much more readable, and understandable than the alternative-which is invariably a loop of some sort. I also realized that like financial statements-Python was not designed for the novice user, rather it is designed for the user that wants to get educated. I can't believe how powerful this language is. When it dawned on me (finally) the purpose and value of lambdas I wanted to rip up about 30 programs and start over putting in lambdas where appropriate.","The writer, a Python beginner, initially struggled to understand the value of lambdas but after reading David Mertz's book, they finally grasped their usefulness.

890128,Why are Python lambdas useful?,"In Python, <code>lambda</code> is just a way of defining functions inline, and.. ..are the exact same. There is nothing you can do with lambda which you cannot do with a regular function&mdash;in Python functions are an object just like anything else, and lambdas simply define a function: I honestly think the <code>lambda</code> keyword is redundant in Python&mdash;I have never had the need to use them (or seen one used where a regular function, a list-comprehension or one of the many builtin functions could have been better used instead) For a completely random example, from the article ""Python__________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________s lambda is broken! "": To see how lambda is broken, try generating a list of functions <code>fs=[f0,...,f9]</code> where <code>fi(n)=i+n</code>. First attempt: I would argue, even if that did work, it's horribly and ""unpythonic"", the same functionality could be written in countless other ways, for example: Yes, it's not the same, but I have never seen a cause where generating a group of lambda functions in a list has been required. It might make sense in other languages, but Python is not Haskell (or Lisp, or ...) Please note that we can use lambda and still achieve the desired   results in this way : Edit: There are a few cases where lambda is useful, for example it's often convenient when connecting up signals in PyQt applications, like this: Just doing <code>w.textChanged.connect(dothing)</code> would call the <code>dothing</code> method with an extra <code>event</code> argument and cause an error. Using the lambda means we can tidily drop the argument without having to define a wrapping function.","Python lambdas are useful for defining small, inline functions, but they are not essential as the same functionality can be achieved with regular functions or other methods.

35837,What is the Difference Between Mercurial and Git?,"I work on Mercurial, but fundamentally I believe both systems are equivalent. They both work with the same abstractions: a series of snapshots (changesets) which make up the history. Each changeset knows where it came from (the parent changeset) and can have many child changesets. The recent hg-git extension provides a two-way bridge between Mercurial and Git and sort of shows this point. Git has a strong focus on mutating this history graph (with all the consequences that entails) whereas Mercurial does not encourage history rewriting, but it's easy to do anyway and the consequences of doing so are exactly what you should expect them to be (that is, if I modify a changeset you already have, your client will see it as new if you pull from me). So Mercurial has a <em>bias</em> towards non-destructive commands. As for light-weight branches, then Mercurial has supported repositories with <em>multiple branches</em> since..., always I think. Git repositories with multiple branches are exactly that: multiple diverged strands of development in a single repository. Git then adds names to these strands and allow you to query these names remotely. The Bookmarks extension for Mercurial adds local names, and with Mercurial 1.6, you can move these bookmarks around when you push/pull.. I use Linux, but apparently TortoiseHg is faster and better than the Git equivalent on Windows (due to better usage of the poor Windows filesystem). Both http://github.com and http://bitbucket.org provide online hosting, the service at Bitbucket is great and responsive (I haven't tried github). I chose Mercurial since it feels clean and elegant -- I was put off by the shell/Perl/Ruby scripts I got with Git. Try taking a peek at the <code>git-instaweb.sh</code> file if you want to know what I mean: it is a <strong>shell</strong> script which generates a <strong>Ruby</strong> script, which I think runs a webserver. The shell script generates another shell script to launch the first Ruby script. There is also a bit of <strong>Perl</strong>, for good measure. I like the blog post that compares Mercurial and Git with James Bond and MacGyver -- Mercurial is somehow more low-key than Git. It seems to me, that people using Mercurial are not so easily impressed. This is reflected in how each system do what Linus described as ""the coolest merge EVER!"". In Git you can merge with an unrelated repository by doing: Those commands look quite arcane to my eye. In Mercurial we do: Notice how the Mercurial commands are plain and not special at all -- the only unusual thing is the <code>--force</code> flag to <code>hg pull</code>, which is needed since Mercurial will abort otherwise when you pull from an unrelated repository. It is differences like this that makes Mercurial seem more elegant to me.","The main difference between Mercurial and Git is their approach to handling the history graph. Git focuses on mutating the history graph, while Mercurial does not encourage history rewriting and has a bias towards non-destructive commands. Both systems support lightweight branches, but Git adds names to these branches and allows remote querying, whereas Mercurial uses bookmarks that can be moved around when pushing or pulling. The author prefers Mercurial for its clean and elegant design, and notes that Mercurial commands are often simpler and more straightforward than Git commands.

894490,SQL left join vs multiple tables on FROM line?,"The old syntax, with just listing the tables, and using the <code>WHERE</code> clause to specify the join criteria, is being deprecated in most modern databases. It's not just for show, the old syntax has the possibility of being ambiguous when you use both INNER and OUTER joins in the same query. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose you have 3 tables in your system: BIGBLOCK Each table contain numerous rows, linked together. You got multiple companies, and each company can have multiple departments, and each department can have multiple employees. Ok, so now you want to do the following: List all the companies, and include all their departments, and all their employees. Note that some companies don't have any departments yet, but make sure you include them as well. Make sure you only retrieve departments that have employees, but always list all companies. So you do this: BIGBLOCK Note that the last one there is an inner join, in order to fulfill the criteria that you only want departments with people. Ok, so what happens now. Well, the problem is, it depends on the database engine, the query optimizer, indexes, and table statistics. Let me explain. If the query optimizer determines that the way to do this is to first take a company, then find the departments, and then do an inner join with employees, you're not going to get any companies that don't have departments. The reason for this is that the <code>WHERE</code> clause determines which <em>rows</em> end up in the final result, not individual parts of the rows. And in this case, due to the left join, the Department.ID column will be NULL, and thus when it comes to the INNER JOIN to Employee, there's no way to fulfill that constraint for the Employee row, and so it won't appear. On the other hand, if the query optimizer decides to tackle the department-employee join first, and then do a left join with the companies, you will see them. So the old syntax is ambiguous. There's no way to specify what you want, without dealing with query hints, and some databases have no way at all. Enter the new syntax, with this you can choose. For instance, if you want all companies, as the problem description stated, this is what you would write: BIGBLOCK Here you specify that you want the department-employee join to be done as one join, and then left join the results of that with the companies. Additionally, let's say you only want departments that contains the letter X in their name. Again, with old style joins, you risk losing the company as well, if it doesn't have any departments with an X in its name, but with the new syntax, you can do this: BIGBLOCK This extra clause is used for the joining, but is not a filter for the entire row. So the row might appear with company information, but might have NULLs in all the department and employee columns for that row, because there is no department with an X in its name for that company. This is hard with the old syntax. This is why, amongst other vendors, Microsoft has deprecated the old outer join syntax, but not the old inner join syntax, since SQL Server 2005 and upwards. The only way to talk to a database running on Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or 2008, using the old style outer join syntax, is to set that database in 8.0 compatibility mode (aka SQL Server 2000). Additionally, the old way, by throwing a bunch of tables at the query optimizer, with a bunch of WHERE clauses, was akin to saying ""here you are, do the best you can"". With the new syntax, the query optimizer has less work to do in order to figure out what parts goes together. So there you have it. LEFT and INNER JOIN is the wave of the future.","The old SQL syntax of listing tables in the `FROM` clause and using the `WHERE` clause to specify join criteria is being deprecated due to its ambiguity, particularly when using both inner and outer joins.

From the Java Language Specification, Java SE 7 Edition, Section 8.3.1.3. <code>transient</code> Fields: Variables may be marked <code>transient</code> to  indicate that they are not part of the  persistent state of an object. For example, you may have fields that are derived from other fields, and should only be done so programmatically, rather than having the state be persisted via serialization. Here's a <code>GalleryImage</code> class which contains an image and a thumbnail derived from the image: In this example, the <code>thumbnailImage</code> is a thumbnail image that is generated by invoking the <code>generateThumbnail</code> method. The <code>thumbnailImage</code> field is marked as <code>transient</code>, so only the original <code>image</code> is serialized rather than persisting both the original image and the thumbnail image. This means that less storage would be needed to save the serialized object. (Of course, this may or may not be desirable depending on the requirements of the system -- this is just an example.) At the time of deserialization, the <code>readObject</code> method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object back to the state at which the serialization occurred. Here, the thumbnail needs to be generated, so the <code>readObject</code> method is overridden so that the thumbnail will be generated by calling the <code>generateThumbnail</code> method. For additional information, the Discover the secrets of the Java Serialization API article (which was originally available on the Sun Developer Network) has a section which discusses the use of and presents a scenario where the <code>transient</code> keyword is used to prevent serialization of certain fields.","The `transient` keyword in Java is used to prevent serialization of certain fields in an object.

4. **Architecture**: Most application servers have a web server as an integral part,",Following are some of the key differences in features of Web Server and Application Server: <li>Web Server is designed to serve HTTP Content.,"Most of the times these terms Web Server and Application server are used interchangeably. <li>Web Server is designed to serve HTTP Content.

936197,What is the difference between application server and web server?,"As Rutesh and jmservera pointed out, the distinction is a fuzzy one. Historically, they were different, but through the 90's these two previously distinct categories blended features and effectively merged. At this point is is probably best to imagine that the ""App Server"" product category is a strict superset of the ""web server"" category. Some history. In early days of the Mosaic browser and hyperlinked content, there evolved this thing called a ""web server"" that served web page content and images over HTTP. Most of the content was static, and the HTTP 1.0 protocol was just a way to ship files around. Quickly the ""web server"" category evolved to include CGI capability - effectively launching a process on each web request to generate dynamic content. HTTP also matured and the products became more sophisticated, with caching, security, and management features. As the technology matured, we got company-specific Java-based server-side technology from Kiva and NetDynamics, which eventually all merged into JSP. Microsoft added ASP, I think in 1996, to Windows NT 4.0. The static web server had learned some new tricks, so that it was an effective ""app server"" for many scenarios. In a parallel category, the app server had evolved and existed for a long time. companies delivered products for Unix like Tuxedo, TopEnd, Encina that were philosophically derived from Mainframe application management and monitoring environments like IMS and CICS. Microsoft's offering was Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), which later evolved into COM+. Most of these products specified ""closed"" product-specific communications protocols to interconnect ""fat"" clients to servers. (For Encina, the comms protocol was DCE RPC; for MTS it was DCOM; etc.) In 1995/96, these traditional app server products began to embed basic HTTP communication capability, at first via gateways. And the lines began to blur. Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads, more concurrency, and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability. At this point the line between ""app server"" and ""web server"" is a fuzzy one. But people continue to use the terms differently, as a matter of emphasis. When someone says ""web server"" you often think HTTP-centric, web UI, oriented apps. When someone says ""App server"" you may think ""heavier loads, enterprise features, transactions and queuing, multi-channel communication (HTTP + more). But often it is the same product that serves both sets of workload requirements. <li>WebSphere, IBM's ""app server"" has its own bundled web server. <li>WebLogic, another traditional app server, likewise. <li>Windows, which is Microsoft's App Server (in addition to being its File&amp;Print Server, Media Server, etc. ), bundles IIS.","The difference between an application server and a web server is blurry and has evolved over time.

Then to derive a good key from this information: The magic numbers (which could be defined as constants somewhere) 65536 and 256 are the key derivation iteration count and the key size, respectively. The key derivation function is iterated to require significant computational effort, and that prevents attackers from quickly trying many different passwords. The iteration count can be changed depending on the computing resources available. The key size can be reduced to 128 bits, which is still considered ""strong"" encryption, but it doesn't give much of a safety margin if attacks are discovered that weaken AES. Used with a proper block-chaining mode, the same derived key can be used to encrypt many messages. In CBC, a random initialization vector (IV) is generated for each message, yielding different cipher text even if the plain text is identical. CBC may not be the most secure mode available to you (see AEAD below); there are many other modes with different security properties, but they all use a similar random input. In any case, the outputs of each encryption operation are the cipher text and the initialization vector: Store the <code>ciphertext</code> and the <code>iv</code>. On decryption, the <code>SecretKey</code> is regenerated in exactly the same way, using using the password with the same salt and iteration parameters. Initialize the cipher with this key and the initialization vector stored with the message: Java 7 included API support for AEAD cipher modes, and the ""SunJCE"" provider included with OpenJDK and Oracle distributions implements these beginning with Java 8. One of these modes is strongly recommended in place of CBC; it will protect the integrity of the data as well as their privacy. A <code>java.security.InvalidKeyException</code> with the message ""Illegal key size or default parameters"" means that the cryptography strength is limited; the unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files are not in the correct location.

1028250,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external ""stimuli"" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations. This is pretty well suited to UI design, for example, in which touching a user interface control (say, the volume control on a music playing application) might need to update various display items and the actual volume of audio output. When you modify the volume (a slider, let's say) that would correspond to modifying the value associated with a node in a directed graph. Various nodes having edges from that ""volume value"" node would automatically be triggered and any necessary computations and updates would naturally ripple through the application. The application ""reacts"" to the user stimulus. Functional reactive programming would just be the implementation of this idea in a functional language, or generally within a functional programming paradigm. For more on ""dataflow computing"", search for those two words on Wikipedia or using your favorite search engine. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs ""triggered"" or ""marked"". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. The graph might be implicit or explicit depending on exactly how reactive programming is implemented. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Dataflow computing is fairly well suited to situations in which triggering computations asynchronously giving rise to cascades of computations works better than trying to have execution be governed by a clock (or clocks). Reactive programming imports this ""cascade of execution"" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the ""outside world"" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. Program execution would then look like something analogous to a complex reflex arc. The program may or may not be basically sessile between stimuli or may settle into a basically sessile state between stimuli. ""non-reactive"" programming would be programming with a very different view of the flow of execution and relationship to external inputs. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs ""reacts"" to them. But looking at the spirit of the thing, a program that polls an event queue at a fixed interval and dispatches any events found to functions (or threads) is less reactive (because it only attends to user input at a fixed interval). Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.","Reactive programming is a paradigm that involves creating a directed graph of nodes, where each node performs a computation and is triggered by external stimuli, such as user input.

1028250,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"In pure functional programming, there are no side-effects. For many types of software (for example, anything with user interaction) side-effects are necessary at some level. One way to get side-effect like behavior while still retaining a functional style is to use functional reactive programming. This is the combination of functional programming, and reactive programming. (The Wikipedia article you linked to is about the latter.) The basic idea behind reactive programming is that there are certain datatypes that represent a value ""over time"". Computations that involve these changing-over-time values will themselves have values that change over time. For example, you could represent the mouse coordinates as a pair of integer-over-time values. Let's say we had something like (this is pseudo-code): BIGBLOCK At any moment in time, x and y would have the coordinates of the mouse. Unlike non-reactive programming, we only need to make this assignment once, and the x and y variables will stay ""up to date"" automatically. This is why reactive programming and functional programming work so well together: reactive programming removes the need to mutate variables while still letting you do a lot of what you could accomplish with variable mutations. If we then do some computations based on this the resulting values will also be values that change over time. For example: BIGBLOCK In this example, <code>minX</code> will always be 16 less than the x coordinate of the mouse pointer. With reactive-aware libraries you could then say something like: BIGBLOCK And a 32x32 box will be drawn around the mouse pointer and will track it wherever it moves. Here is a pretty good paper on functional reactive programming.","Functional reactive programming is a combination of functional programming and reactive programming, allowing for side-effect-like behavior while retaining a functional style. It involves using datatypes that represent values ""over time"", enabling computations that change over time without the need for variable mutations.

(Code without a specification is an answer without a question and thus ""not even wrong"". )So I don't describe FRP in representation/implementation terms as Thomas K does in another answer (graphs, nodes, edges, firing, execution, etc).There are many possible implementation styles, but no implementation says what FRP <em>is</em>. I do resonate with Laurence G's simple description that FRP is about ""datatypes that represent a value 'over time' "".Conventional imperative programming captures these dynamic values only indirectly, through state and mutations.The complete history (past, present, future) has no first class representation.Moreover, only <em>discretely evolving</em> values can be (indirectly) captured, since the imperative paradigm is temporally discrete.In contrast, FRP captures these evolving values <em>directly</em> and has no difficulty with <em>continuously</em> evolving values. FRP is also unusual in that it is concurrent without running afoul of the theoretical &amp; pragmatic rats' nest that plagues imperative concurrency.Semantically, FRP's concurrency is <em>fine-grained</em>, <em>determinate</em>, and <em>continuous</em>. (I'm talking about meaning, not implementation. An implementation may or may not involve concurrency or parallelism. )Semantic determinacy is very important for reasoning, both rigorous and informal.While concurrency adds enormous complexity to imperative programming (due to nondeterministic interleaving), it is effortless in FRP. So, what is FRP?You could have invented it yourself.Start with these ideas: <li>Dynamic/evolving values (i.e., values ""over time"") are first class values in themselves. You can define them and combine them, pass them into &amp; out of functions. I called these things ""behaviors"". <li>Behaviors are built up out of a few primitives, like constant (static) behaviors and time (like a clock), and then with sequential and parallel combination. <em>n</em> behaviors are combined by applying an n-ary function (on static values), ""point-wise"", i.e., continuously over time. <li>To account for discrete phenomena, have another type (family) of ""events"", each of which has a stream (finite or infinite) of occurrences. Each occurrence has an associated time and value. <li>To come up with the compositional vocabulary out of which all behaviors and events can be built, play with some examples. Keep deconstructing into pieces that are more general/simple. <li>So that you know you're on solid ground, give the whole model a compositional foundation, using the technique of denotational semantics, which just means that (a) each type has a corresponding simple &amp; precise mathematical type of ""meanings"", and (b) each primitive and operator has a simple &amp; precise meaning as a function of the meanings of the constituents.<em>Never, ever</em> mix implementation considerations into your exploration process. If this description is gibberish to you, consult (a) <em>Denotational design with type class morphisms</em>, (b) <em>Push-pull functional reactive programming</em> (ignoring the implementation bits), and (c) the <em>Denotational Semantics</em> Haskell wikibooks page. Beware that denotational semantics has two parts, from its two founders Christopher Strachey and Dana Scott: the easier &amp; more useful Strachey part and the harder and less useful (for software design) Scott part. If you stick with these principles, I expect you'll get something more-or-less in the spirit of FRP. Where did I get these principles? In software design, I always ask the same question: ""what does it mean? "".Denotational semantics gave me a precise framework for this question, and one that fits my aesthetics (unlike operational or axiomatic semantics, both of which leave me unsatisfied).So I asked myself what is behavior?I soon realized that the temporally discrete nature of imperative computation is an accommodation to a particular style of <em>machine</em>, rather than a natural description of behavior itself.The simplest precise description of behavior I can think of is simply ""function of (continuous) time"", so that's my model.Delightfully, this model handles continuous, deterministic concurrency with ease and grace. It's been quite a challenge to implement this model correctly and efficiently, but that's another story.","Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on handling dynamic, evolving values over time in a direct and continuous manner. It treats these values as first-class citizens, allowing them to be defined, combined, and passed into and out of functions. FRP is based on the idea of ""behaviors"" (continuous values over time) and ""events"" (discrete occurrences with associated times and values). The key principles of FRP include:

1. Dynamic values are first-class values that can be defined and combined.
2. Behaviors are built from primitives like constant values and time, and combined using sequential and parallel","<li>Dynamic/evolving values (i.e., values ""over time"") are first class values in themselves.

Polymorphism is a feature that allows treating an object of a subclass as if it were of its superclass type. It enables writing code that can work with objects of different classes without knowing their specific class type, as long as they share a common parent class. This promotes flexibility, modularity, and code reuse.

**Key Points:**

* Treats a subclass object as if it were of its superclass type
* Enables writing code that works with objects of different classes
* Promotes flexibility, modularity, and code reuse
* Allows for more generic and abstract code

1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","If you think about the Greek roots of the term, it should become obvious. Poly = many: polygon = many-sided, polystyrene = many styrenes (a), polyglot = many languages, and so on. Morph = change or form: morphology = study of biological form, Morpheus = the Greek god of dreams able to take any form. So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). For example, in many languages, integers and floats are implicitly polymorphic since you can add, subtract, multiply and so on, irrespective of the fact that the types are different. They're rarely considered as objects in the usual term. But, in that same way, a class like <code>BigDecimal</code> or <code>Rational</code> or <code>Imaginary</code> can also provide those operations, even though they operate on different data types. The classic example is the <code>Shape</code> class and all the classes that can inherit from it (square, circle, dodecahedron, irregular polygon, splat and so on). With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. A point shape needs only two co-ordinates (assuming it's in a two-dimensional space of course). A circle needs a center and radius. A square or rectangle needs two co-ordinates for the top left and bottom right corners and (possibly) a rotation. An irregular polygon needs a series of lines. By making the class responsible for its code as well as its data, you can achieve polymorphism. In this example, every class would have its own <code>Draw()</code> function and the client code could simply do: to get the correct behavior for any shape. This is in contrast to the old way of doing things in which the code was separate from the data, and you would have had functions such as <code>drawSquare()</code> and <code>drawCircle()</code>. Object orientation, polymorphism and inheritance are all closely-related concepts and they're vital to know. There have been many ""silver bullets"" during my long career which basically just fizzled out but the OO paradigm has turned out to be a good one. Learn it, understand it, love it - you'll be glad you did :-) (a) I originally wrote that as a joke but it turned out to be correct and, therefore, not that funny. The momomer styrene happens to be made from carbon and hydrogen, <code>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub></code>, and polystyrene is made from groups of that, <code>(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)<sub>n</sub></code>. Perhaps I should have stated that a polyp was many occurrences of the letter <code>p</code> although, now that I've had to explain the joke, even that doesn't seem funny either.

1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","Generally speaking, it's the ability to interface a number of different types of object using the same or a superficially similar API. There are various forms: Function overloading: defining multiple functions with the same name and different parameter types, such as sqrt(float), sqrt(double) and sqrt(complex). In most languages that allow this, the compiler will automatically select the correct one for the type of argument being passed into it, thus this is compile-time polymorphism. Virtual methods in OOP: a method of a class can have various implementations tailored to the specifics of its subclasses; each of these is said to override the implementation given in the base class. Given an object that may be of the base class or any of its subclasses, the correct implementation is selected on the fly, thus this is run-time polymorphism. Templates: a feature of some OO languages whereby a function, class, etc. can be parameterised by a type. For example, you can define a generic ""list"" template class, and then instantiate it as ""list of integers"", ""list of strings"", maybe even ""list of lists of strings"" or the like. Generally, you write the code once for a data structure of arbitrary element type, and the compiler generates versions of it for the various element types.","Polymorphism is the ability to interact with different object types using a similar interface.

1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","Polymorphism is the ability of the programmer to write methods of the same name that do different things for different types of objects, depending on the needs of those objects. For example, if you were developing a class called <code>Fraction</code> and a class called <code>ComplexNumber</code>, both of these might include a method called <code>display()</code>, but each of them would implement that method differently. In PHP, for example, you might implement it like this: Outputs: Some of the other answers seem to imply that polymorphism is used only in conjunction with inheritance; for example, maybe <code>Fraction</code> and <code>ComplexNumber</code> both implement an abstract class called <code>Number</code> that has a method <code>display()</code>, which Fraction and ComplexNumber are then both obligated to implement. But you don't need inheritance to take advantage of polymorphism. At least in dynamically-typed languages like PHP (I don't know about C++ or Java), polymorphism allows the developer to call a method without necessarily knowing the type of object ahead of time, and trusting that the correct implementation of the method will be called. For example, say the user chooses the type of <code>Number</code> created: In this case, the appropriate <code>display()</code> method will be called, even though the developer can't know ahead of time whether the user will choose a fraction or a complex number.","**Polymorphism** is a programming concept that allows methods with the same name to perform different actions for different object types.

This allows C code to link to and use the function or variable using a C-compatible header file. The main effects of `extern ""C""` are:

1. **No name mangling**: The C++ compiler will not add argument/parameter type information to the name used for linkage.

1041866,"What is the effect of extern ""C"" in C++?","In every C++ program, all non-static functions are represented in the binary file as symbols. These symbols are special text strings that uniquely identify a function in the program. In C, the symbol name is the same as the function name. This is possible because in C no two non-static functions can have the same name. Because C++ allows overloading and has many features that C does not Ã©Â?like classes, member functions, exception specifications - it is not possible to simply use the function name as the symbol name. To solve that, C++ uses so-called name mangling, which transforms the function name and all the necessary information (like the number and size of the arguments) into some weird-looking string processed only by the compiler and linker. So if you specify a function to be extern C, the compiler doesn't performs name mangling with it and it can be directly accessed using its symbol name as the function name. This comes handy while using <code>dlsym()</code> and <code>dlopen()</code> for calling such functions.","The `extern ""C""` directive in C++ prevents name mangling, allowing a function to be accessed using its original name as the symbol name, rather than a mangled name.

For example, if you have a <strong>DataReader</strong> and loop through all records using a <code>foreach</code> it automatically calls the <strong>Dispose</strong> method and closes the reader (which can then close the connection automatically). This is therefore safer as it prevents connection leaks even if you forget to close the reader. (Sure it is good practise to always close readers but the compiler is not going to catch it if you don't - you can't guarantee you have closed all readers but you can make it more likely you won't leak connections by getting in the habit of using foreach.) There may be other examples of the implicit call of the <code>Dispose</code> method being useful.","The question of getting the index of the current iteration in a foreach loop is not directly addressed in the provided text. Instead, the text defends the use of foreach loops over for loops in certain situations, such as when working with a DataReader, as it automatically calls the Dispose method, helping prevent connection leaks.

1074081,Hibernate Error: org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException: a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session,"I have had this error many times and it can be quite hard to track down... Basically, what hibernate is saying is that you have two objects which have the same identifier (same primary key) but they are not the same object. I would suggest you break down your code, i.e. comment out bits until the error goes away and then put the code back until it comes back and you should find the error it. It most often happens via cascading saves where there is a cascade save between object A and B, but object B has already been associated with the session but not on the same instance of B. What primary key generator are you using? The reason I ask is this error is related to how you're telling hibernate to ascertain the persistent state of an object (i.e. whether an object is persistent or not). The error could be happening because hibernate is trying to persist and object that is already persistent. In fact, if you use save hibernate will try and persist that object, and maybe there is already an object with that same primary key associated with the session. Example Assuming you have a hibernate class object for a table with 10 rows based on a primary key combination (column 1 and column 2). Now, you have removed 5 rows from the table at some point of time. Now, if you try to add the same 10 rows again, while hibernate tries to persist the objects in database, 5 rows which were already removed will be added without errors. Now the remaining 5 rows which are already existing, will throw this exception. So the easy approach would be checking if you have updated/removed any value in a table which is part of something and later are you trying to insert the same objects again","The `org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException` occurs when Hibernate encounters two objects with the same identifier (primary key) but they are not the same object instance. To resolve this, break down the code to identify the problematic section, and check for cascading saves between objects.

Common scenarios that cause this error include trying to insert objects that were previously removed or updated, and then re-adding them.

Otherwise, it's not a singleton. This is a very odd requirement, hardly ever of interest to the user. Processes and address space isolation are an implementation detail. They only impact on the user when they want to stop your application using <code>kill</code> or Task Manager. Apart from building a caching system, there aren't that many reasons why you'd be so certain that there should only be on instance of something per process. How about a logging system? Might be better for that to be per-thread or more fine-grained so you can trace the origin of messages more automatically. How about the application's main window? It depends; maybe you'll want all the user's documents to be managed by the same process for some reason, in which case there would be multiple ""main windows"" in that process.","Singletons are generally considered bad design because they are rarely necessary, as the requirement for a single instance of an object per process address space is unusual and often not in the user's interest.

This is important when the string itself is in the data segment of a program and shouldn't be changed. <code>bar</code> is a constant or fixed pointer to a value that can be changed. This is like a reference without the extra syntactic sugar. Because of this fact, usually you would use a reference where you would use a <code>T* const</code> pointer unless you need to allow <code>NULL</code> pointers.","The difference between `const int*`, `const int * const`, and `int const *` can be understood by reading the declarations backwards.

1177449,Best approach to remove time part of datetime in SQL Server,"I, personally, almost always use User Defined functions for this if dealing with SQL Server 2005 (or lower version), however, it should be noted that there are specific drawbacks to using UDF's, especially if applying them to WHERE clauses (see below and the comments on this answer for further details). If using SQL Server 2008 (or higher) - see below. In fact, for most databases that I create, I add these UDF's in right near the start since I know there's a 99% chance I'm going to need them sooner or later. I create one for ""date only"" &amp; ""time only"" (although the ""date only"" one is by far the most used of the two). Here's some links to a variety of date-related UDF's: Essential SQL Server Date, Time and DateTime Functions Get Date Only Function That last link shows no less than 3 different ways to getting the date only part of a datetime field and mentions some pros and cons of each approach. If using a UDF, it should be noted that you should try to avoid using the UDF as part of a WHERE clause in a query as this will greatly hinder performance of the query. The main reason for this is that using a UDF in a WHERE clause renders that clause as non-sargable, which means that SQL Server can no longer use an index with that clause in order to improve the speed of query execution. With reference to my own usage of UDF's, I'll frequently use the ""raw"" date column within the WHERE clause, but apply the UDF to the SELECTed column. In this way, the UDF is only applied to the filtered result-set and not every row of the table as part of the filter. Of course, the absolute <em>best</em> approach for this is to use SQL Server 2008 (or higher) and separate out your dates and times, as the SQL Server database engine is then natively providing the individual date and time components, and can efficiently query these independently without the need for a UDF or other mechanism to extract either the date or time part from a composite datetime type.","To remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server, the best approach depends on the version. For SQL Server 2005 or lower, using User Defined Functions (UDFs) is recommended, but with caution to avoid using them in WHERE clauses due to performance issues. For SQL Server 2008 or higher, it's best to separate dates and times into individual components, allowing for efficient querying without UDFs.

151969,When to use self over $this?,"The keyword self does <strong>NOT</strong> refer merely to the 'current class', at least not in a way that restricts you to static members. Within the context of a non-static member, <code>self</code> also provides a way of bypassing the vtable (see wiki on vtable) for the current object.

This will output: Hello, I'm Ludwig the geek Goodbye from Ludwig the person <code>sayHello()</code> uses the <code>$this</code> pointer, so the vtable is invoked to call <code>Geek::getTitle()</code>.<code>sayGoodbye()</code> uses <code>self::getTitle()</code>, so the vtable is not used, and <code>Person::getTitle()</code> is called. In both cases, we are dealing with the method of an instantiated object, and have access to the <code>$this</code> pointer within the called functions.","To summarize: 

Use `self` instead of `$this` when you want to bypass the vtable and call the current class's implementation of a method directly, rather than relying on the virtual table to resolve the method call. This is useful when you want to ensure that a specific class's method is called, rather than a potentially overridden version in a subclass. 

In contrast, `$this` should be used when you want to access the current object's properties and methods, and allow for polymorphic behavior through the vtable.

1251636,What do Clustered and Non clustered index actually mean?,"A clustered index means you are telling the database to store close values actually close to one another on the disk. This has the benefit of rapid scan / retrieval of records falling into some range of clustered index values. For example, you have two tables, Customer and Order: If you wish to quickly retrieve all orders of one particular customer, you may wish to create a clustered index on the ""CustomerID"" column of the Order table. This way the records with the same CustomerID will be physically stored close to each other on disk (clustered) which speeds up their retrieval. P.S. The index on CustomerID will obviously be not unique, so you either need to add a second field to ""uniquify"" the index or let the database handle that for you but that's another story. Regarding multiple indexes. You can have only one clustered index per table because this defines how the data is physically arranged. If you wish an analogy, imagine a big room with many tables in it. You can either put these tables to form several rows or pull them all together to form a big conference table, but not both ways at the same time. A table can have other indexes, they will then point to the entries in the clustered index which in its turn will finally say where to find the actual data.","Here is a summary:

**Clustered Index:**

* Stores close values physically close to each other on disk
* Improves scan and retrieval of records within a range of index values
* Only one clustered index per table, defining physical data arrangement
* Example: Creating a clustered index on ""CustomerID"" in the Order table to quickly retrieve all orders for a customer

**Non-Clustered Index:**

* Does not store data physically close to each other
* Can have multiple non-clustered indexes per table
* Points to entries in the clustered index, which then locates the actual data
* Allows for multiple indexing",,A clustered index means you are telling the database to store close values actually close to one another on the disk. This has the benefit of rapid scan / retrieval of records falling into some range of clustered index values.
1251636,What do Clustered and Non clustered index actually mean?,"With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index. Therefore, there can be only one clustered index. With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows. You can have many non clustered indexes, although each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records. It is generally faster to read from a clustered index if you want to get back all the columns. You do not have to go first to the index and then to the table. Writing to a table with a clustered index can be slower, if there is a need to rearrange the data.","Here's a summary:

**Clustered Index:**

* Rows are stored physically on disk in the same order as the index

**Non-Clustered Index:**

28002,Regular cast vs. static_cast vs. dynamic_cast,"You should look at the article <em>C++ Programming/Type Casting</em>. It contains a good description of all of the different cast types. The following taken from the above link: const_cast const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types. 'e.g.' char->long, int->short etc. Static cast is also used to cast pointers to related types, for  example casting void* to the appropriate type. dynamic_cast Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy). dynamic_cast(expression) The target type must be a pointer or reference type, and the  expression must evaluate to a pointer or reference. Dynamic cast works  only when the type of object to which the expression refers is  compatible with the target type and the base class has at least one  virtual member function. If not, and the type of expression being cast  is a pointer, NULL is returned, if a dynamic cast on a reference  fails, a bad_cast exception is thrown. When it doesn't fail, dynamic  cast returns a pointer or reference of the target type to the object  to which expression referred. reinterpret_cast Reinterpret cast simply casts one type bitwise to another. Any pointer  or integral type can be casted to any other with reinterpret cast,  easily allowing for misuse. For instance, with reinterpret cast one  might, unsafely, cast an integer pointer to a string pointer.","The main differences between regular cast, static_cast, and dynamic_cast in C++ are:

1. **const_cast**: Used to add or remove const (or volatile) properties from a variable.
2. **static_cast**: Used to cast between integer types (e.g., char to long, int to short) and to cast pointers to related types (e.g., void* to a specific type).
3. **dynamic_cast**: Used to convert pointers and references at runtime, typically for casting up or down an inheritance hierarchy. It requires a virtual member function in the base class and returns NULL (for pointers) or throws a bad_cast","char->long, int->short etc. dynamic_cast Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy).

And if you have many exceptions in your application it's usually a good idea to have a common custom base class for all of them, so that users of your modules can do And in that case you can do the <code>__init__ and __str__</code> needed there, so you don't have to repeat it for every exception. But simply calling the message variable something else than message does the trick. In any case, you only need the <code>__init__ or __str__</code> if you do something different from what Exception itself does. And because if the deprecation, you then need both, or you get an error. That's not a whole lot of extra code you need per class. ;)","To declare custom exceptions in modern Python, it's recommended to avoid using the deprecated ""message"" variable. Instead, create a custom base class that inherits from Exception and defines `__init__` and `__str__` methods. This allows for a standardized way of handling exceptions across your application, and users of your modules can catch all custom exceptions with a single `except` block. You can also subclass from specific exceptions like ValueError and adapt to their usage. Simply renaming the ""message"" variable or implementing the required methods can resolve deprecation errors.","And if you have many exceptions in your application it's usually a good idea to have a common custom base class for all of them, so that users of your modules can do","And if you have many exceptions in your application it's usually a good idea to have a common custom base class for all of them, so that users of your modules can do"

1303646,Check whether variable is number or string in JavaScript,Best way to do that is using isNaN + type casting: Updated all-in method: The same using regex:,"To check whether a variable is a number or a string in JavaScript, you can use several methods:

1. **isNaN() with type casting**: This involves attempting to convert the variable to a number and then checking if the result is NaN (Not a Number). If it's not NaN, then the variable can be considered a number.

2. **Using regex**: Regular expressions can be used to match numeric patterns, allowing you to determine if a string consists entirely of numbers.

Here's a summary of how you might implement these checks:

To quote the blog entry: The value of the setting is not ""appname.models.modelname"", it's just ""appname.modelname"".

I just timed two variants under gcc 4.3.3 compiled with -O3 using C++ inlines to eliminate function call overhead, one billion iterations, keeping the running sum of all counts to ensure the compiler doesn't remove anything important, using rdtsc for timing (clock cycle precise). The unmodified Hacker's Delight took 12.2 gigacycles. My parallel version (counting twice as many bits) runs in 13.0 gigacycles. 10.5s total elapsed for both together on a 2.4GHz Core Duo. 25 gigacycles = just over 10 seconds at this clock frequency, so I'm confident my timings are right. This has to do with instruction dependency chains, which are very bad for this algorithm. I could nearly double the speed again by using a pair of 64-bit registers. In fact, if I was clever and added x+y a little sooner I could shave off some shifts. The 64-bit version with some small tweaks would come out about even, but count twice as many bits again. With 128 bit SIMD registers, yet another factor of two, and the SSE instruction sets often have clever short-cuts, too. There's no reason for the code to be especially transparent. The interface is simple, the algorithm can be referenced on-line in many places, and it's amenable to comprehensive unit test. The programmer who stumbles upon it might even learn something. These bit operations are extremely natural at the machine level. OK, I decided to bench the tweaked 64-bit version. For this one  sizeof(unsigned long) == 8 That looks about right (I'm not testing carefully, though). Now the timings come out at 10.70 gigacycles / 14.1 gigacycles. That later number summed 128 billion bits and corresponds to 5.9s elapsed on this machine. The non-parallel version speeds up a tiny bit because I'm running in 64-bit mode and it likes 64-bit registers slightly better than 32-bit registers. Let's see if there's a bit more OOO pipelining to be had here. This was a bit more involved, so I actually tested a bit. Each term alone sums to 64, all combined sum to 256. I was excited for a moment, but it turns out gcc is playing inline tricks with -O3 even though I'm not using the inline keyword in some tests. When I let gcc play tricks, a billion calls to pop4() takes 12.56 gigacycles, but I determined it was folding arguments as constant expressions. A more realistic number appears to be 19.6gc for another 30% speed-up. My test loop now looks like this, making sure each argument is different enough to stop gcc from playing tricks. 256 billion bits summed in 8.17s elapsed. Works out to 1.02s for 32 million bits as benchmarked in the 16-bit table lookup. Can't compare directly, because the other bench doesn't give a clock speed, but looks like I've slapped the snot out of the 64KB table edition, which is a tragic use of L1 cache in the first place. Update: decided to do the obvious and create pop6() by adding four more duplicated lines. Came out to 22.8gc, 384 billion bits summed in 9.5s elapsed. So there's another 20%   Now at 800ms for 32 billion bits.","The question asks how to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer. The answer discusses various approaches to optimize this operation, including using parallel processing, 64-bit registers, and SIMD instructions. The author benchmarks different versions of the code, including a 32-bit version, a 64-bit version, and a version using SSE instructions. The results show that the optimized versions can achieve significant speedups, with the fastest version taking around 800ms to count 32 billion bits. The author concludes that using bit operations and optimizing for the micro-architecture can lead to substantial performance improvements.",,

The normal, Pythonic, preferred solution is almost invariably ""duck typing"": try using the argument <em>as if</em> it was of a certain desired type, do it in a <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> statement catching all exceptions that could arise if the argument was not in fact of that type (or any other type nicely duck-mimicking it;-), and in the <code>except</code> clause, try something else (using the argument ""as if"" it was of some other type). <code>basestring</code> <strong>is</strong>, however, quite a special caseÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂ builtin type that exists <strong>only</strong> to let you use <code>isinstance</code> (both <code>str</code> and <code>unicode</code> subclass <code>basestring</code>). Strings are sequences (you could loop over them, index them, slice them, ...), but you generally want to treat them as ""scalar"" typesÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂt's somewhat incovenient (but a reasonably frequent use case) to treat all kinds of strings (and maybe other scalar types, i.e., ones you can't loop on) one way, all containers (lists, sets, dicts, ...) in another way, and <code>basestring</code> plus <code>isinstance</code> helps you do thatÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂhe overall structure of this idiom is something like: You could say that <code>basestring</code> is an <em>Abstract Base Class</em> (""ABC"")Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂt offers no concrete functionality to subclasses, but rather exists as a ""marker"", mainly for use with <code>isinstance</code>. The concept is obviously a growing one in Python, since PEP 3119, which introduces a generalization of it, was accepted and has been implemented starting with Python 2.6 and 3.0. The PEP makes it clear that, while ABCs can often substitute for duck typing, there is generally no big pressure to do that (see here). ABCs as implemented in recent Python versions do however offer extra goodies: <code>isinstance</code> (and <code>issubclass</code>) can now mean more than just ""[an instance of] a derived class"" (in particular, any class can be ""registered"" with an ABC so that it will show as a subclass, and its instances as instances of the ABC); and ABCs can also offer extra convenience to actual subclasses in a very natural way via Template Method design pattern applications (see here and here [[part II]] for more on the TM DP, in general and specifically in Python, independent of ABCs). For the underlying mechanics of ABC support as offered in Python 2.6, see here; for their 3.1 version, very similar, see here. In both versions, standard library module collections (that's the 3.1 versionÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂor the very similar 2.6 version, see here) offers several useful ABCs. For the purpose of this answer, the key thing to retain about ABCs (beyond an arguably more natural placement for TM DP functionality, compared to the classic Python alternative of mixin classes such as UserDict.DictMixin) is that they make <code>isinstance</code> (and <code>issubclass</code>) much more attractive and pervasive (in Python 2.6 and going forward) than they used to be (in 2.5 and before), and therefore, by contrast, make checking type equality an even worse practice in recent Python versions than it already used to be.","The main difference between `type()` and `isinstance()` in Python is that `isinstance()` supports inheritance, whereas checking for equality of `type()` does not. `isinstance()` checks if an object is an instance of a class or its subclass, while `type()` checks for exact type match. 

In general, `isinstance()` is preferred over `type()` because it seamlessly supports inheritance, making it more flexible and Pythonic. However, the most Pythonic approach is often ""duck typing"", where you try to use an object as if it were of a certain type and handle exceptions if it doesn't work.

`","The normal, Pythonic, preferred solution is almost invariably ""duck typing"": try using the argument <em>as if</em> it was of a certain desired type, do it in a <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> statement catching all exceptions that could arise if the argument was not in fact of that type (or any other type nicely duck-mimicking it;-), and in the <code>except</code> clause, try something else (using the argument ""as if"" it was of some other type).","To summarize the contents of other (already good!) answers, <code>isinstance</code> caters for inheritance (an instance of a derived class <em>is an</em> instance of a base class, too), while checking for equality of <code>type</code> does not (it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes, AKA subclasses).

You put the public key on the server. You should use a passphrase, if you don't you have the equivalent of a plain-text password in your private key. But when you do, then you need as a practical matter <code>ssh-agent</code> as explained below.) You want to be running <code>ssh-agent</code> in the background as you log in. Once you log in, the idea is to run <code>ssh-add</code> once and only once, in order to give the agent your passphrase, to decode your key.

I will go through the details in case, like me, you also have a Cygwin or other windows environment where this most certainly is not done for you. Start here: <code>man ssh-agent</code>. There are various ways to automatically run the agent. As the man page explains, you can run it so that it is a parent of all your login session's other processes. That way, the environment variables it provides will automatically be in all your shells. When you (later) invoke <code>ssh-add</code> or <code>ssh</code> both will have access to the agent because they all have the environment variables with magic socket pathnames or whatever. Alternatively, you can run the agent as an ordinary child, save the environment settings in a file, and source that file in every shell when it starts. My OSX and Ubuntu systems automatically do the agent launch setup, so all I have to do is run <code>ssh-add</code> once. Try running <code>ssh-add</code> and see if it works, if so, then you just need to do that once per reboot. My Cygwin system needed it done manually, so I did this in my <code>.profile</code> and I have <code>.bashrc</code> source <code>.profile</code>: BIGBLOCK The <code>.agent</code> file is created automatically by the script; it contains the environment variables definitions and exports.

1595848,Configuring Git over SSH to login once,"I think there are two different things here. The first one is that normal SSH authentication requires the user to put the account's password (where the account password will be authenticated against different methods, depending on the sshd configuration). You can avoid putting that password using certificates. With certificates you still have to put a password, but this time is the password of your private key (that's independent of the account's password). To do this you can follow the instructions pointed out by steveth45: With Public Key Authentication. If you want to avoid putting the certificate's password every time then you can use ssh-agent, as pointed out by DigitalRoss The exact way you do this depends on Unix vs Windows, but essentially you need to run ssh-agent in the background when you log in, and then the first time you log in, run ssh-add to give the agent your passphrase. All ssh-family commands will then consult the agent and automatically pick up your passphrase. Start here: man ssh-agent. The only problem of ssh-agent is that, on *nix at least, you have to put the certificates password on every new shell. And then the certificate is ""loaded"" and you can use it to authenticate against an ssh server without putting any kind of password. But this is on that particular shell. With keychain you can do the same thing as ssh-agent but ""system-wide"". Once you turn on your computer, you open a shell and put the password of the certificate. And then, every other shell will use that ""loaded"" certificate and your password will never be asked again until you restart your PC.

136097,What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?,"Maybe a bit of example code will help: Notice the difference in the call signatures of <code>foo</code>, <code>class_foo</code> and <code>static_foo</code>: Below is the usual way an object instance calls a method. The object instance, <code>a</code>, is implicitly passed as the first argument. <strong>With classmethods</strong>, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument instead of <code>self</code>. You can also call <code>class_foo</code> using the class. In fact, if you define something to bea classmethod, it is probably because you intend to call it from the class rather than from a class instance. <code>A.foo(1)</code> would have raised a TypeError, but <code>A.class_foo(1)</code> works just fine: One use people have found for class methods is to create inheritable alternative constructors. <strong>With staticmethods</strong>, neither <code>self</code> (the object instance) nor  <code>cls</code> (the class) is implicitly passed as the first argument. They behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an instance or the class: Staticmethods are used to group functions which have some logical connection with a class to the class. <code>foo</code> is just a function, but when you call <code>a.foo</code> you don't just get the function,you get a ""partially applied"" version of the function with the object instance <code>a</code> bound as the first argument to the function. <code>foo</code> expects 2 arguments, while <code>a.foo</code> only expects 1 argument. <code>a</code> is bound to <code>foo</code>. That is what is meant by the term ""bound"" below: With <code>a.class_foo</code>, <code>a</code> is not bound to <code>class_foo</code>, rather the class <code>A</code> is bound to <code>class_foo</code>. Here, with a staticmethod, even though it is a method, <code>a.static_foo</code> just returnsa good 'ole function with no arguments bound. <code>static_foo</code> expects 1 argument, and<code>a.static_foo</code> expects 1 argument too. And of course the same thing happens when you call <code>static_foo</code> with the class <code>A</code> instead.","The main difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python is how they handle the first argument when called. 

- `@classmethod` implicitly passes the class of the object instance as the first argument, instead of `self`. This allows for inheritable alternative constructors and is often used when calling from the class rather than an instance.

- `@staticmethod` neither implicitly passes `self` (the object instance) nor `cls` (the class) as the first argument, behaving like a plain function. It's used to group functions logically connected to a class without binding the instance or class to the function.

In essence","One use people have found for class methods is to create inheritable alternative constructors. <strong>With staticmethods</strong>, neither <code>self</code> (the object instance) nor  <code>cls</code> (the class) is implicitly passed as the first argument.","Below is the usual way an object instance calls a method.

When you invoke an EXE file like this with complex command line arguments it is usually very helpful to have a tool that will show you how PowerShell sends the arguments to the EXE file. The PowerShell Community Extensions has such a tool. It is called echoargs. You just replace the EXE file with echoargs - leaving all the arguments in place, and it will show you how the EXE file will receive the arguments, for example: Using echoargs you can experiment until you get it right, for example: It turns out I was trying too hard before to maintain the double quotes around the connection string. Apparently that isn't necessary because even cmd.exe will strip those out. BTW, hats off to the PowerShell team. They were quite helpful in showing me the specific incantation of single &amp; double quotes to get the desired result - if you needed to keep the internal double quotes in place. :-)  They also realize this is an area of pain, but they are driven by the number of folks are affected by a particular issue.

Multiple items are a violation of contract, an exception is thrown. <strong>Performance Difference</strong> <li><code>FirstOrDefault</code> is usually faster, it iterates until it finds the element and only has to iterate the whole enumerable when it doesn't find it. In many cases, there is a high probability to find an item. <li><code>SingleOrDefault</code> needs to check if there is only one element and therefore always iterates the whole enumerable. To be precise, it iterates until it finds a second element and throws an exception. But in most cases, there is no second element. <strong>Conclusion</strong> <li>Use <code>FirstOrDefault</code> if you don't care how many items there are <strong>or</strong> when you can't afford checking uniqueness (e.g. in a very large collection).

1835018,How to check if an object is a list or tuple (but not string)?,"Remember that in Python we want to use ""duck typing"". So, anything that acts like a list can be treated as a list. So, don't check for the type of a list, just see if it acts like a list. But strings act like a list too, and often that is not what we want. There are times when it is even a problem! So, check explicitly for a string, but then use duck typing. Here is a function I wrote for fun. It is a special version of <code>repr()</code> that prints any sequence in angle brackets ('&lt;', '>'). This is clean and elegant, overall. But what's that <code>isinstance()</code> check doing there? That's kind of a hack. But it is essential. This function calls itself recursively on anything that acts like a list. If we didn't handle the string specially, then it would be treated like a list, and split up one character at a time. But then the recursive call would try to treat each character as a list -- and it would work! Even a one-character string works as a list! The function would keep on calling itself recursively until stack overflow. Functions like this one, that depend on each recursive call breaking down the work to be done, have to special-case strings--because you can't break down a string below the level of a one-character string, and even a one-character string acts like a list. Note: the <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> is the cleanest way to express our intentions. But if this code were somehow time-critical, we might want to replace it with some sort of test to see if <code>arg</code> is a sequence. Rather than testing the type, we should probably test behaviors. If it has a <code>.strip()</code> method, it's a string, so don't consider it a sequence; otherwise, if it is indexable or iterable, it's a sequence: EDIT: I originally wrote the above with a check for <code>__getslice__()</code> but I noticed that in the <code>collections</code> module documentation, the interesting method is <code>__getitem__()</code>; this makes sense, that's how you index an object. That seems more fundamental than <code>__getslice__()</code> so I changed the above.","To check if an object is a list or tuple (but not a string) in Python, use duck typing to verify if it acts like a list, while explicitly checking for strings to avoid treating them as lists.

You certainly can use <code>isinstance</code> or duck typing to check an argument, but why should you? That sounds like a rhetorical question, but it isn't.

Why is it a bug when a string is passed to the function? Also:  if it's a bug when a string is passed to this function, is it also a bug if some other non-list/tuple iterable is passed to it? Why, or why not? I think that the most common answer to the question is likely to be that developers who write <code>f(""abc"")</code> are expecting the function to behave as though they'd written <code>f([""abc""])</code>.

3881,IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?,"Voted up Jason Cohen's argument because it was well presented. Let me dismember it step by step. ;-) The NPE JavaDoc explicitly says, ""other illegal uses of the null object"". If it was just limited to situations where the runtime encounters a null when it shouldn't, all such cases could be defined far more succinctly. Can't help it if you assume the wrong thing, but assuming encapsulation is applied properly, you really shouldn't care or notice whether a null was dereferenced inappropriately vs. whether a method detected an inappropriate null and fired an exception off. I'd choose NPE over IAE for multiple reasons It is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation Logic that mistakenly allows nulls tends to be very different from logic that mistakenly allows illegal values. For example, if I'm validating data entered by a user, if I get value that is unacceptable, the source of that error is with the end user of the application. If I get a null, that's programmer error. Invalid values can cause things like stack overflows, out of memory errors, parsing exceptions, etc. Indeed, most errors generally present, at some point, as an invalid value in some method call. For this reason I see IAE as actually the MOST GENERAL of all exceptions under RuntimeException. Actually, other invalid arguments can result in all kinds of other exceptions. UnknownHostException, FileNotFoundException, a variety of syntax error exceptions, IndexOutOfBoundsException, authentication failures, etc., etc. In general, I feel NPE is much maligned because traditionally has been associated with code that fails to follow the fail fast principle. That, plus the JDK's failure to populate NPE's with a message string really has created a strong negative sentiment that isn't well founded. Indeed, the difference between NPE and IAE from a runtime perspective is strictly the name. From that perspective, the more precise you are with the name, the more clarity you give to the caller.","The author argues that when encountering a null parameter, it's better to throw a NullPointerException (NPE) rather than an IllegalArgumentException (IAE). The reasons are:

1. NPE is more specific about the nature of the error.
2. Logic that allows nulls is often different from logic that allows invalid values.
3. NPE typically indicates programmer error, whereas IAE can be caused by various sources, including user input.
4. IAE is a more general exception that can encompass various types of errors, making NPE a more precise choice.

The author believes that the negative sentiment towards NPE is unfounded and that using","I'd choose NPE over IAE for multiple reasons Logic that mistakenly allows nulls tends to be very different from logic that mistakenly allows illegal values.

Depending on your answer, one of the following sets ofsettings should work for you: <li><strong>For tab characters that appear 4-spaces-wide</strong>: If you're using actual tab character in your source code you probably also want these settings (these are actually the defaults, but you may want to set them defensively): Finally, if you want an indent to correspond to a single tab, you should also use: <li><strong>For indents that consist of 4 space characters</strong> but are entered with the tab key: <strong>To make the above settings permanent addthese lines to your vimrc.</strong> In case you need to make adjustments, or would simply like to understand what these options all mean, here's a breakdown of what each option means: The width of a hard tabstop measured in ""spaces"" -- effectively the (maximum) width of an actual tab character.

Setting this to a non-zero value other than <code>tabstop</code> will make the tab key (in insert mode)   insert a combination of spaces (and possibly tabs) to <em>simulate</em> tab stops at this width. Enabling this will make the tab key (in insert mode) insert spaces instead of   tab characters. This also affects the behavior of the <code>retab</code> command. Enabling this will make the tab key (in insert mode) insert spaces or tabs to  go to the next indent  of the next tabstop when the cursor is at the beginning of a line (i.e. the  only preceding characters are whitespace). For more details on any of these see <code>:help '<em>optionname</em>'</code> in vim (e.g. <code>:help 'tabstop'</code>)","To redefine a tab as 4 spaces, you have two options:

This trick makes it possible for the server to ""inject"" javascript code directly in the Client browser and this with bypassing the ""same origin"" restrictions. In other words, you can have cross-domain data exchange. Normally, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> doesn't permit cross-domain data-exchange directly (one needs to go through a server in the same domain) whereas: <code>&lt;script src=""some_other_domain/some_data.js&amp;prefix=function_prefix</code>>` one can access data from a domain different than from the origin. Also worth noting: even though the server should be considered as ""trusted"" before attempting that sort of ""trick"", the side-effects of possible change in object format etc. can be contained. If a <code>function_prefix</code> (i.e. a proper js function) is used to receive the JSON object, the said function can perform checks before accepting/further processing the returned data.","JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a technique that allows for cross-domain data exchange by appending a prefix to a JSON object, which is then evaluated as a JavaScript expression by the browser.

2067472,What is JSONP all about?,"It's actually not too complicated... Say you're on domain example.com, and you want to make a request to domain example.net. To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland. The one item that bypasses this limitation is &lt;script&gt; tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really do anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated. Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle. For example, say the server expects a parameter called ""callback"" to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like: Without JSONP, this might return some basic JavaScript object, like so: However, with JSONP, when the server receives the ""callback"" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this: As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function: And now, when the script is loaded, it'll be evaluated, and your function will be executed. Voila, cross-domain requests! It's also worth noting the one major issue with JSONP: you lose a lot of control of the request. For example, there is no ""nice"" way to get proper failure codes back. As a result, you end up using timers to monitor the request, etc, which is always a bit suspect. The proposition for JSONRequest is a great solution to allowing cross domain scripting, maintaining security, and allowing proper control of the request. These days (2015), CORS is the recommended approach vs. JSONRequest. JSONP is still useful for older browser support, but given the security implications, unless you have no choice CORS is the better choice.","JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a technique used to bypass browser limitations on cross-domain requests. It works by using the `<script>` tag, which ignores domain limitations, and passing a callback parameter to the server, which wraps the response in a function that can be handled by the requesting page. This allows for cross-domain requests, but has limitations, such as losing control of the request and no proper error handling. JSONP is still useful for older browser support, but CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is now the recommended approach for cross-domain requests due to its improved security and control.","The one item that bypasses this limitation is &lt;script&gt; tags.

Suppose you have a routine which which was going to do log a given timestamp. You want the routine to use the current time minus 30 minutes.

2. Using the `Invoke` method to call the target method, passing the method name and the array of parameters.

This approach allows for dynamic method invocation based on the method name provided as a string and the parameters passed as an array of objects",with params: you basically pass in an array of objects along with name of method. you then use both with the Invoke method. params Object[] parameters,you basically pass in an array of objects along with name of method. you then use both with the Invoke method.

2095397,"What is the difference between JSF, Servlet and JSP?","JSP (JavaServer Pages) JSP is a Java view technology running on the server machine which allows you to write template text in client side languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ect.). JSP supports taglibs, which are backed by pieces of Java code that let you control the page flow or output dynamically. A well-known taglib is JSTL. JSP also supports Expression Language, which can be used to access backend data (via attributes available in the page, request, session and application scopes), mostly in combination with taglibs. When a JSP is requested for the first time or when the web app starts up, the servlet container will compile it into a class extending <code>HttpServlet</code> and use it during the web app's lifetime. You can find the generated source code in the server's work directory. In for example Tomcat, it's the <code>/work</code> directory. On a JSP request, the servlet container will execute the compiled JSP class and send the generated output (usually just HTML/CSS/JS) through the web server over a network to the client side, which in turn displays it in the web browser. Servlets Servlet is a Java application programming interface (API) running on the server machine, which intercepts requests made by the client and generates/sends a response. A well-known example is the <code>HttpServlet</code> which provides methods to hook on HTTP requests using the popular HTTP methods such as <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>. You can configure <code>HttpServlet</code>s to listen to a certain HTTP URL pattern, which is configurable in <code>web.xml</code>, or more recently with Java EE 6, with <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation. When a Servlet is first requested or during web app startup, the servlet container will create an instance of it and keep it in memory during the web app's lifetime. The same instance will be reused for every incoming request whose URL matches the servlet's URL pattern. You can access the request data by <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and handle the response by <code>HttpServletResponse</code>. Both objects are available as method arguments inside any of the overridden methods of <code>HttpServlet</code>, such as <code>doGet()</code> and <code>doPost()</code>. JSF (JavaServer Faces) JSF is a component based MVC framework which is built on top of the Servlet API and provides components via taglibs which can be used in JSP or any other Java based view technology such as Facelets. Facelets is much more suited to JSF than JSP. It namely provides great templating capabilities such as composite components, while JSP basically only offers the <code>&lt;jsp:include&gt;</code> for templating, so that you're forced to create custom components with raw Java code (which is a bit opaque and a lot of tedious work in JSF) when you want to replace a repeated group of components with a single component. Since JSF 2.0, JSP has been deprecated as view technology in favor of Facelets. As being a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, JSF provides the <code>FacesServlet</code> as the sole request-response Controller. It takes all the standard and tedious HTTP request/response work from your hands, such as gathering user input, validating/converting them, putting them in model objects, invoking actions and rendering the response. This way you end up with basically a JSP or Facelets (XHTML) page for View and a JavaBean class as Model. The JSF components are used to bind the view with the model (such as your ASP.NET web control does) and the <code>FacesServlet</code> uses the JSF component tree to do all the work.

2130416,What are the applications of binary trees?,"When most people talk about binary trees, they're more often than not thinking about binary <em>search</em> trees, so I'll cover that first. A non-balanced binary search tree is actually useful for little more than educating students about data structures. That's because, unless the data is coming in in a relatively random order, the tree can easily degenerate into its worst-case form, which is a linked list, since simple binary trees are <em>not</em> balanced. A good case in point: I once had to fix some software which loaded its data into a binary tree for manipulation and searching. It wrote the data out in sorted form: BIGBLOCK so that, when reading it back in, ended up with the following tree: BIGBLOCK which is the degenerate form. If you go looking for Frank in that tree, you'll have to search all six nodes before you find him. Binary trees become truly useful when you balance them. This involves rotating sub-trees through their root node so that the height difference between any two sub-trees is less than or equal to 1. Adding those names above one at a time into a balanced tree would give you the following sequence: BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK You can actually see whole sub-trees rotating to the left as the entries are added and this gives you a balanced binary tree in which the worst case lookup is O(log N) rather than O(N) as the degenerate form gives. At no point does the highest NULL (<code>=</code>) differ from the lowest by more than one level. And, in the final tree above, you can find Frank by only looking at three nodes (<code>Chloe</code>, <code>Edwina</code> and, finally, <code>Frank</code>). Of course, they become even more useful when you make them balanced <em>multi-way</em> trees rather than binary tress. That means that each node holds more than one item (technically, they hold N items and N+1 pointers, a binary tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree  with 1 item and 2 pointers). With a three-way tree, you end up with: BIGBLOCK This is typically used in maintaining keys for an index of items. I've written database software optimised for the hardware where a node is exactly the size of a disk block (say, 512 bytes) and you put as many keys as you can into a single node. The <em>pointers</em> in this case were actually record numbers into a fixed-length-record direct-access file separate from the index file (so record number <code>X</code> could be found by just seeking to <code>X * record_length</code>). For example, if the pointers are 4 bytes and the key size is 10, the number of keys in a 512-byte node is 36. That's 36 keys (360 bytes) and 37 pointers (148 bytes) for a total of 508 bytes with 4 bytes wasted per node. The use of multi-way keys introduces the complexity of a two-phase search (multi-way search to find the correct node combined with a small sequential search to find the correct key in the node) but the advantage in doing less disk I/O more than makes up for this. I see no reason to do this for an in-memory structure, you'd be better off sticking with a balanced binary tree and keeping your code simple. Also keep in mind that the advantages of O(log N) over O(N) don't really appear when your data sets are small. If you're using a multi-way tree to store the fifteen people in your address book, it's probably overkill. The advantages come when you're storing something like every order from your hundred thousand customers over the last ten years. The whole point of big-O notation is to indicate what happens as the N approaches infinity. Some people may disagree but it's even okay to use bubble sort if you're sure the data sets will stay below a certain size, as long as nothing else is readily available :-) As to other uses for binary trees, there are a great many, such as: <li>Binary heaps where higher keys are <em>above or equal to</em> lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right); <li>Hash trees, similar to hash tables; <li>Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages; <li>Huffman trees for compression of data; <li>Routing trees for network traffic.

28002,Regular cast vs. static_cast vs. dynamic_cast,"static_cast <code>static_cast</code> is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. <code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Example: In this example, you know that you passed a <code>MyClass</code> object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this. dynamic_cast <code>dynamic_cast</code> is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a <code>bad_cast</code> exception is thrown in that case). You cannot use <code>dynamic_cast</code> if you downcast (cast to a derived class) and the argument type is not polymorphic. For example, the following code is not valid, because <code>Base</code> doesn't contain any virtual function: An ""up-cast"" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both <code>static_cast</code> and <code>dynamic_cast</code>, and also without any cast, as an ""up-cast"" is an implicit conversion. Regular Cast These casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering <code>dynamic_cast</code>. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of <code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code> and <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use <code>dynamic_cast</code>. In addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the ""equivalent"" <code>static_cast</code> sequence would give you a compile-time error for that. Some people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity. I use them for numeric casts only, and use the appropriate C++ casts when user defined types are involved, as they provide stricter checking.","The main differences between regular cast, `static_cast`, and `dynamic_cast` in C++ are:

1. **Regular Cast (C-style cast)**: Attempts a range of C++ casts, excluding `dynamic_cast`, and takes the first one that works. It's powerful but unsafe and allows casting to private base classes.
2. **`static_cast`**: Used for reversing implicit conversions, with no runtime checks. It's suitable when you know the object's type and don't need a runtime check.

The reason that binary trees are used more often than n-ary trees for searching is that n-ary trees are more complex, but usually provide no real speed advantage. In a (balanced) binary tree with <code>m</code> nodes, moving from one level to the next requires one comparison, and there are <code>log_2(m)</code> levels, for a total of <code>log_2(m)</code> comparisons.

Namely, SpecialEmployee's get a 2% bonus just like regular employees. But if you remove the ""static""s, then SpecialEmployee's get a 3% bonus. (Admittedly, this example is poor coding style in that in real life you would likely want the bonus multiplier to be in a database somewhere rather than hard-coded. But that's just because I didn't want to bog down the example with a lot of code irrelevant to the point.) It seems quite plausible to me that you might want to make getBonusMultiplier static. Perhaps you want to be able to display the bonus multiplier for all the categories of employees, without needing to have an instance of an employee in each category. What would be the point of searching for such example instances? What if we are creating a new category of employee and don't have any employees assigned to it yet? This is quite logically a static function. But it doesn't work. And yes, yes, I can think of any number of ways to rewrite the above code to make it work. My point is not that it creates an unsolvable problem, but that it creates a trap for the unwary programmer, because the language does not behave as I think a reasonable person would expect. Perhaps if I tried to write a compiler for an OOP language, I would quickly see why implementing it so that static functions can be overriden would be difficult or impossible. Or perhaps there is some good reason why Java behaves this way. Can anyone point out an advantage to this behavior, some category of problem that is made easier by this? I mean, don't just point me to the Java language spec and say ""see, this is documented how it behaves"". I know that. But is there a good reason why it SHOULD behave this way? (Besides the obvious ""making it work right was too hard""...) <strong>Update</strong> @VicKirk: If you mean that this is ""bad design"" because it doesn't fit how Java handles statics, my reply is, ""Well, duh, of course."" As I said in my original post, it doesn't work. But if you mean that it is bad design in the sense that there would be something fundamentally wrong with a language where this worked, i.e. where statics could be overridden just like virtual functions, that this would somehow introduce an ambiguity or it would be impossible to implement efficiently or some such, I reply, ""Why? What's wrong with the concept?"" I think the example I give is a very natural thing to want to do. I have a class that has a function that does not depend on any instance data, and which I might very reasonably want to call independent of an instance, as well as wanting to call from within an instance method. Why should this not work? I've run into this situation a fair number of times over the years. In practice I get around it by making the function virtual, and then creating a static method whose only purpose in life is to be a static method that passes the call on to the virtual method with a dummy instance. That seems like a very roundabout way to get there.","The author believes that Java's design flaw is not allowing the overriding of static methods. They provide an example where a static method `getBonusMultiplier` is not overridden in a subclass `SpecialEmployee`, leading to unexpected behavior. The author argues that it's reasonable to want to make this method static, as it doesn't depend on instance data and might be called independently of an instance. They acknowledge that there are workarounds, but think it's a trap for unwary programmers and wonder if there's a good reason why Java behaves this way, seeking an advantage or a category of problem that is made easier by this behavior.","Personally I think this is a flaw in the design of Java.

* Use `padding` when you want to add space inside an element, making the element itself larger. This space is part of the element and will receive clicks and fill with the element's background color.
* Use `margin` when you want to add space outside an element, separating it from other elements. This space is not part of the element and will not receive clicks, instead, clicks will go to the parent element.

In the provided example, the `.inner` element has a `margin` of 10px, which creates space",,"An object receives clicks to its padding, but clicks on an objects margin'd area go to its parent."

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so. Pros: Your code gets decoupled so you can easily exchange implementations of an interface with alternative implementations It is a strong motivator for coding against interfaces instead of implementations It's very easy to write unit tests for your code because it depends on nothing else than the objects it accepts in its constructor/setters and you can easily initialize them with the right objects in isolation. Cons: IoC not only inverts the control flow in your program, it also clouds it considerably. This means you can no longer just read your code and jump from one place to another because the connections that would normally be in your code are not in the code anymore. Instead it is in XML configuration files or annotations and in the code of your IoC container that interprets these metadata. There arises a new class of bugs where you get your XML config or your annotations wrong and you can spend a lot of time finding out why your IoC container injects a null reference into one of your objects under certain conditions. Personally I see the strong points of IoC and I really like them but I tend to avoid IoC whenever possible because it turns your software into a collection of classes that no longer constitute a ""real"" program but just something that needs to be put together by XML configuration or annotation metadata and would fall (and falls) apart without it.","Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that decouples code, making it easier to exchange implementations and write unit tests. However, it also makes the code more complex and harder to understand, as the connections between components are defined in external configuration files or annotations rather than in the code itself. While IoC has benefits, such as promoting coding against interfaces and making testing easier, it can also lead to new types of bugs and make the software more dependent on external configuration. Ultimately, IoC should be used judiciously, weighing its pros and cons, and considering whether its benefits outweigh the added complexity it introduces.",,"Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so.

Update: after checking the answer of Pekka on your question which contains a link to bobince's answer that PHP would always return <code>HTTP_HOST</code>'s value for <code>SERVER_NAME</code>, which goes against my own PHP 4.x + Apache HTTPD 1.2.x experiences from a couple of years ago, I blew some dust from my current XAMPP environment on Windows XP (Apache HTTPD 2.2.1 with PHP 5.2.8), started it, created a PHP page which prints the both values, created a Java test application using <code>URLConnection</code> to modify the <code>Host</code> header and tests taught me that this is indeed (incorrectly) the case. After first suspecting PHP and digging in some PHP bug reports regarding the subject, I learned that the root of the problem is in web server used, that it incorrectly returned HTTP <code>Host</code> header when <code>SERVER_NAME</code> was requested. So I dug into Apache HTTPD bug reports using various keywords regarding the subject and I finally found a related bug. This behaviour was introduced since around Apache HTTPD 1.3. You need to set <code>UseCanonicalName</code> directive to <code>on</code> in the <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> entry of the <code>ServerName</code> in <code>httpd.conf</code> (also check the warning at the bottom of the document! ). This worked for me. Summarized, <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is more reliable, but you're dependent on the server config!","The key differences between `HTTP_HOST` and `SERVER_NAME` in PHP are:

1. **Source**: `HTTP_HOST` comes from the HTTP request header, while `SERVER_NAME` is defined in the server configuration.
2. **Reliability**: `SERVER_NAME` is more reliable as it's a server-controlled value, whereas `HTTP_HOST` is client-controlled and may not be trustworthy.
3. **Configuration**: The web server, specifically Apache HTTPD, needs to have `SERVER_NAME` correctly configured, and the `UseCanonicalName` directive set to `on` to ensure `SERVER_NAME` returns the expected value.",The <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is defined in server config.

The rationale for the presence of checked exceptions is that for some kinds of exceptions, you must not ignore the fact that they may happen, because their happening is quite a regular situation, not a program error.

2223386,Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?,"In Java (and many OOP languages, but I cannot speak for all; and some do not have static at all) all methods have a fixed signature - the parameters and types. In a virtual method, the first parameter is implied: a reference to the object itself and when called from within the object, the compiler automatically adds <code>this</code>. There is no difference for static methods - they still have a fixed signature. However, by declaring the method static you have explicitly stated that the compiler must not include the implied object parameter at the beginning of that signature. Therefore, any other code that calls this must <em>must not attempt to put a reference to an object on the stack</em>. If it did do that, then the method execution would not work since the parameters would be in the wrong place - shifted by one - on the stack. Because of this difference between the two; virtual methods always have a reference to the context object (i.e. <code>this</code>) so then it is possible to reference anything within the heap that belong to that instance of the object. But with static methods, since there is no reference passed, that method cannot access any object variables and methods since the context is not known. If you wish that Java would change the definition so that a object context is passed in for every method, static or virtual, then you would in essence have only virtual methods. As someone asked in a comment to the op - what is your reason and purpose for wanting this feature? I do not know Ruby much, as this was mentioned by the OP, I did some research. I see that in Ruby classes are really a special kind of object and one can create (even dynamically) new methods. Classes are full class objects in Ruby, they are not in Java. This is just something you will have to accept when working with Java (or C#). These are not dynamic languages, though C# is adding some forms of dynamic. In reality, Ruby does not have ""static"" methods as far as I could find - in that case these are methods on the singleton class object. You can then override this singleton with a new class and the methods in the previous class object will call those defined in the new class (correct?). So if you called a method in the context of the original class it still would only execute the original statics, but calling a method in the derived class, would call methods either from the parent or sub-class. Interesting and I can see some value in that. It takes a different thought pattern. Since you are working in Java, you will need to adjust to that way of doing things. Why they did this? Well, probably to improve performance at the time based on the technology and understanding that was available. Computer languages are constantly evolving. Go back far enough and there is no such thing as OOP. In the future, there will be other new ideas. <strong>EDIT</strong>: One other comment. Now that I see the differences and as I Java/C# developer myself, I can understand why the answers you get from Java developers may be confusing if you are coming from a language like Ruby. Java <code>static</code> methods are not the same as Ruby <code>class</code> methods. Java developers will have a hard time understanding this, as will conversely those who work mostly with a language like Ruby/Smalltalk. I can see how this would also be greatly confusing by the fact that Java also uses ""class method"" as another way to talk about static methods but this same term is used differently by Ruby. Java does not have Ruby style class methods (sorry); Ruby does not have Java style static methods which are really just old procedural style functions, as found in C. By the way - thanks for the question! I learned something new for me today about class methods (Ruby style).","Java does not allow overriding of static methods because static methods do not have an implied object parameter, which is a reference to the object itself, unlike virtual methods. This means that static methods cannot access object variables and methods since the context is not known. The reason for this design choice is likely to improve performance, and it's a fundamental difference between Java and languages like Ruby, which have a different concept of class methods. Java's static methods are essentially procedural-style functions, whereas Ruby's class methods are methods on the singleton class object and can be overridden. This difference in design requires developers to adjust their thinking when working with Java.","But with static methods, since there is no reference passed, that method cannot access any object variables and methods since the context is not known.

2422468,How to upload files to server using JSP/Servlet?,"Introduction To browse and select a file for upload you need a HTML <code>&lt;input type=""file""&gt;</code> field in the form. As stated in the HTML specification you have to use the <code>POST</code> method and the <code>enctype</code> attribute of the form has to be set to <code>""multipart/form-data""</code>. After submitting such a form, the binary multipart form data is available in the request body in a different format than when the <code>enctype</code> isn't set. Before Servlet 3.0, the Servlet API didn't natively support <code>multipart/form-data</code>. It supports only the default form enctype of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. The <code>request.getParameter()</code> and consorts would all return <code>null</code> when using multipart form data. This is where the well known Apache Commons FileUpload came into the picture. Don't manually parse it! You can in theory parse the request body yourself based on <code>ServletRequest#getInputStream()</code>. However, this is a precise and tedious work which requires precise knowledge of RFC2388. You shouldn't try to do this on your own or copypaste some homegrown library-less code found elsewhere on the Internet. Many online sources have failed hard in this, such as roseindia.net. See also uploading of pdf file. You should rather use a real library which is used (and implicitly tested!) by millions of users for years. Such a library has proven its robustness. When you're already on Servlet 3.0 or newer, use native API If you're using at least Servlet 3.0 (Tomcat 7, Jetty 9, JBoss AS 6, GlassFish 3, etc), then you can just use standard API provided <code>HttpServletRequest#getPart()</code> to collect the individual multipart form data items (most Servlet 3.0 implementations actually use Apache Commons FileUpload under the covers for this!). Also, normal form fields are available by <code>getParameter()</code> the usual way. First annotate your servlet with <code>@MultipartConfig</code> in order to let it recognize and support <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests and thus get <code>getPart()</code> to work: Then, implement its <code>doPost()</code> as follows: Note the <code>Path#getFileName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. In case you have a <code>&lt;input type=""file"" name=""file"" multiple=""true"" /&gt;</code> for multi-file upload, collect them as below (unfortunately there is no such method as <code>request.getParts(""file"")</code>): When you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, manually get submitted file name Note that <code>Part#getSubmittedFileName()</code> was introduced in Servlet 3.1 (Tomcat 8, Jetty 9, WildFly 8, GlassFish 4, etc). If you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, then you need an additional utility method to obtain the submitted file name. Note the MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. When you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet, use Apache Commons FileUpload If you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet (isn't it about time to upgrade? ), the common practice is to make use of Apache Commons FileUpload to parse the multpart form data requests. It has an excellent User Guide and FAQ (carefully go through both). There's also the O'Reilly (""cos"") <code>MultipartRequest</code>, but it has some (minor) bugs and isn't actively maintained anymore for years. I wouldn't recommend using it. Apache Commons FileUpload is still actively maintained and currently very mature. In order to use Apache Commons FileUpload, you need to have at least the following files in your webapp's <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code>: <code>commons-fileupload.jar</code> <code>commons-io.jar</code> Your initial attempt failed most likely because you forgot the commons IO. Here's a kickoff example how the <code>doPost()</code> of your <code>UploadServlet</code> may look like when using Apache Commons FileUpload: It's very important that you don't call <code>getParameter()</code>, <code>getParameterMap()</code>, <code>getParameterValues()</code>, <code>getInputStream()</code>, <code>getReader()</code>, etc on the same request beforehand. Otherwise the servlet container will read and parse the request body and thus Apache Commons FileUpload will get an empty request body. See also a.o. ServletFileUpload#parseRequest(request) returns an empty list. Note the <code>FilenameUtils#getName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. Alternatively you can also wrap this all in a <code>Filter</code> which parses it all automagically and put the stuff back in the parametermap of the request so that you can continue using <code>request.getParameter()</code> the usual way and retrieve the uploaded file by <code>request.getAttribute()</code>. You can find an example in this blog article. Workaround for GlassFish3 bug of <code>getParameter()</code> still returning <code>null</code> Note that Glassfish versions older than 3.1.2 had a bug wherein the <code>getParameter()</code> still returns <code>null</code>. If you are targeting such a container and can't upgrade it, then you need to extract the value from <code>getPart()</code> with help of this utility method: Saving uploaded file (don't use <code>getRealPath()</code> nor <code>part.write()</code>!)

The disadvantage is the result can be wrong (data which hasn't been committed yet could be returned) and there is no guarantee that the result is repeatable. If you care about accuracy, don't use this. More information is on MSDN: Implements dirty read, or isolation level 0 locking, which means that no shared locks are issued and no exclusive locks are honored. When this option is set, it is possible to read uncommitted or dirty data; values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction. This option has the same effect as setting NOLOCK on all tables in all SELECT statements in a transaction. This is the least restrictive of the four isolation levels.","The READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level can be faster, but it may return incorrect or uncommitted data and results may not be repeatable, making it unsuitable for applications requiring accuracy.","The disadvantage is the result can be wrong (data which hasn't been committed yet could be returned) and there is no guarantee that the result is repeatable.

2471055,Why use a READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level?,"This isolation level allows dirty reads. One transaction may see uncommitted changes made by some other transaction. To maintain the highest level of isolation, a DBMS usually acquires locks on data, which may result in a loss of concurrency and a high locking overhead. This isolation level relaxes this property. You may want to check out the Wikipedia article on <code>READ UNCOMMITTED</code> for a few examples and further reading. You may also be interested in checking out Jeff Atwood's blog article on how he and his team tackled a deadlock issue in the early days of Stack Overflow. According to Jeff: <strong>But is <code>nolock</code> dangerous?</strong> Could you end  up reading invalid data with <code>read uncommitted</code> on? Yes, in theory. You'll  find no shortage of database  architecture astronauts who start  dropping ACID science on you  and all  but pull the building fire alarm when  you tell them you want to try <code>nolock</code>.

Quoting Jeff again: Snapshots rely on an entirely new data change tracking method ... more than just a slight logical change, it requires the server to handle the data physically differently. Once this new data change tracking method is enabled, it creates a copy, or snapshot of every data change. <strong>By reading these snapshots rather than live data at times of contention, Shared Locks are no longer needed on reads, and overall database performance may increase.</strong>","The READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level allows dirty reads, which can increase concurrency and reduce locking overhead, but may result in reading invalid data.

2480650,Role of Bias in Neural Networks,"Two different kinds of parameters can  be adjusted during the training of an  ANN, the weights and the value in the  activation functions. This is  impractical and it would be easier if  only one of the parameters should be  adjusted. To cope with this problem a  bias neuron is invented. The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1. Since the bias neuron  emits 1 the weights, connected to the  bias neuron, are added directly to the  combined sum of the other weights  (equation 2.1), just like the t value  in the activation functions.1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. Consider the AND boolean function represented by the following neural network: ANN http://www.aihorizon.com/images/essays/perceptron.gif <li><em>w0</em> corresponds to <em>b</em>. <li><em>w1</em> corresponds to <em>x1</em>. <li><em>w2</em> corresponds to <em>x2</em>. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions. For example, if we assume boolean values  of 1 (true) and -1 (false), then one  way to use a two-input perceptron to  implement the AND function is to set  the weights w0 = -3, and w1 = w2 = .5. This perceptron can be made to  represent the OR function instead by  altering the threshold to w0 = -.3. In  fact, AND and OR can be viewed as  special cases of m-of-n functions:  that is, functions where at least m of  the n inputs to the perceptron must be  true. The OR function corresponds to  m = 1 and the AND function to m = n.  Any m-of-n function is easily  represented using a perceptron by  setting all input weights to the same  value (e.g., 0.5) and then setting the  threshold w0 accordingly. Perceptrons can represent all of the  primitive boolean functions AND, OR,  NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR). Machine Learning- Tom Mitchell) The threshold is the bias and <em>w0</em> is the weight associated with the bias/threshold neuron.","The role of bias in neural networks is to simplify the training process by allowing only one parameter, the weight, to be adjusted. A bias neuron is introduced, which always emits 1 and is connected to all neurons in the next layer, but not to any in the previous layer. This allows the weights connected to the bias neuron to be added directly to the combined sum of other weights, effectively controlling the behavior of the layer. The bias enables a single neural network to represent similar cases, such as different boolean functions like AND, OR, NAND, and NOR, by adjusting the threshold (bias) and input weights. This makes it easier","To cope with this problem a  bias neuron is invented. The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1.

2480650,Role of Bias in Neural Networks,"I think that biases are almost always helpful. In effect, <strong>a bias value allows you to shift the activation function to the left or right</strong>, which may be critical for successful learning. It might help to look at a simple example. Consider this 1-input, 1-output network that has no bias: The output of the network is computed by multiplying the input (x) by the weight (w0) and passing the result through some kind of activation function (e.g. a sigmoid function.) Here is the function that this network computes, for various values of w0: Changing the weight w0 essentially changes the ""steepness"" of the sigmoid. That's useful, but what if you wanted the network to output 0 when x is 2? Just changing the steepness of the sigmoid won't really work -- <strong>you want to be able to shift the entire curve to the right</strong>. That's exactly what the bias allows you to do. If we add a bias to that network, like so: ...then the output of the network becomes sig(w0*x + w1*1.0). Here is what the output of the network looks like for various values of w1: Having a weight of -5 for w1 shifts the curve to the right, which allows us to have a network that outputs 0 when x is 2.","Biases in neural networks are helpful as they allow the activation function to be shifted to the left or right, enabling the network to learn more effectively. This shift is crucial for successful learning, especially when the desired output requires the curve to be moved horizontally. The addition of a bias term enables the network to achieve this shift, as demonstrated by a simple example of a 1-input, 1-output network with and without a bias. The bias allows the network to output 0 when the input is 2, which would not be possible by just changing the steepness of the sigmoid function.","In effect, <strong>a bias value allows you to shift the activation function to the left or right</strong>, which may be critical for successful learning.

Usage: The code above will actually execute,"To filter a Java Collection efficiently, consider using Java 8's Stream API, which allows for functional programming and lazy evaluation. This approach enables you to filter collections without modifying the original collection or creating unnecessary intermediate collections.

```java
List<String> originalList = Arrays.asList(""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry"");

List<String> filteredList = originalList.stream()

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"I'd like to address the 4 points in the accepted answer, hopefully someone can explain why I'm wrong. Why is hiding dependencies in your code bad? There are already dozens of hidden dependencies (C runtime calls, OS API calls, global function calls), and singleton dependencies are easy to find (search for instance()). ""Making something global to avoid passing it around is a code smell."" Why isn't passing something around to avoid making it a singleton a code smell? If you're passing an object through 10 functions in a call stack just to avoid a singleton, is that so great? Single Responsibility Principle: I think this is a bit vague and depends on your definition of responsibility. A relevant question would be, why does adding this specific ""responsibility"" to a class matter? Why does passing an object to a class make it more tightly coupled than using that object as a singleton from within the class? Why does it change how long the state lasts? Singletons can be created or destroyed manually, so the control is still there, and you can make the lifetime the same as a non-singleton object's lifetime would be. Regarding unit tests: not all classes need to be unit tested not all classes that need to be unit tested need to change the implementation of the singleton if they do need be unit tested and do need to change the implementation, it's easy to change a class from using a singleton to having the singleton passed to it via dependency injection.","The author questions the common criticisms of singletons, arguing that:

1. Hidden dependencies are not unique to singletons and can be easily found.
2. Passing objects through multiple functions to avoid singletons can be just as problematic.
3. The Single Responsibility Principle is vague and doesn't necessarily apply to singletons.
4. Singletons don't necessarily make unit testing more difficult, and their implementation can be easily changed if needed.

The author suggests that the criticisms of singletons may be overstated and that they can be a viable design choice in certain situations.",Single Responsibility Principle: I think this is a bit vague and depends on your definition of responsibility. Regarding unit tests:,

2699086,Sort Multi-dimensional Array by Value,I use this function :,"To sort a multi-dimensional array by value, you can utilize a function that iterates through the array and rearranges its elements based on a specified key or value. This can often be achieved using built-in sorting functions in programming languages, such as `usort` in PHP or `sorted` with a custom key in Python. The function takes an array and a key (which could be a function that returns the value to sort by) as parameters, and it returns the sorted array.

2726657,INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN performance in SQL Server,"A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results. It would also be expected to return more rows, further increasing the total execution time simply due to the larger size of the result set. (And even if a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> <em>were</em> faster in <em>specific</em> situations due to some difficult-to-imagine confluence of factors, it is not functionally equivalent to an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, so you cannot simply go replacing all instances of one with the other!) Most likely your performance problems lie elsewhere, such as not having a candidate key or foreign key indexed properly. 9 tables is quite a lot to be joining so the slowdown could literally be almost anywhere. If you post your schema, we might be able to provide more details. <strong>Edit:</strong> Reflecting further on this, I could think of one circumstance under which a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> might be faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, and that is when: <li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows); <li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query. Consider this example: BIGBLOCK If you run this and view the execution plan, you'll see that the <code>INNER JOIN</code> query does indeed cost more than the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, because it satisfies the two criteria above. It's because SQL Server wants to do a hash match for the <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but does nested loops for the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>; the former is <em>normally</em> much faster, but since the number of rows is so tiny <em>and</em> there's no index to use, the hashing operation turns out to be the most expensive part of the query. You can see the same effect by writing a program in your favourite programming language to perform a large number of lookups on a list with 5 elements, vs. a hash table with 5 elements. Because of the size, the hash table version is actually slower. But increase it to 50 elements, or 5000 elements, and the list version slows to a crawl, because it's O(N) vs. O(1) for the hashtable. But change this query to be on the <code>ID</code> column instead of <code>Name</code> and you'll see a very different story. In that case, it does nested loops for both queries, but the <code>INNER JOIN</code> version is able to replace one of the clustered index scans with a seek - meaning that this will literally be <em>an order of magnitude</em> faster with a large number of rows. So the conclusion is more or less what I mentioned several paragraphs above; this is almost certainly an indexing or index coverage problem, possibly combined with one or more very small tables. Those are the only circumstances under which SQL Server <em>might</em> sometimes choose a worse execution plan for an <code>INNER JOIN</code> than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.","A `LEFT JOIN` is generally slower than an `INNER JOIN` because it requires additional work to null-extend the results. The performance difference is usually due to indexing or index coverage issues, especially with large numbers of joined tables.

Proper indexing and schema design are crucial to optimize performance.","In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results.","A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>.

They are dealt with by the Garbage Collector automatically when they are not used anymore. This is a more complicated approach than C++ where the scope of a variable is entirely deterministic. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. An object can go ""out of scope"" in one function but if its value is returned, then GC would look at whether or not the calling function holds onto the return value. Setting object references to <code>null</code> is unnecessary as garbage collection works by working out which objects are being referenced by other objects. In practice, you don't have to worry about destruction, it just works and it's great :) <code>Dispose</code> must be called on all objects that implement <code>IDisposable</code> when you are finished working with them. Normally you would use a <code>using</code> block with those objects like so: BIGBLOCK <strong>EDIT</strong> On variable scope. Craig has asked whether the variable scope has any effect on the object lifetime. To properly explain that aspect of CLR, I'll need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#. Actual variable scope In both languages the variable can only be used in the same scope as it was defined - class, function or a statement block enclosed by braces. The subtle difference, however, is that in C#, variables cannot be redefined in a nested block. In C++, this is perfectly legal: BIGBLOCK In C#, however you get a a compiler error: BIGBLOCK This makes sense if you look at generated MSIL - all the variables used by the function are defined at the start of the function. Take a look at this function: BIGBLOCK Below is the generated IL. Note that iVal2, which is defined inside the if block is actually defined at function level. Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned. BIGBLOCK C++ scope and object lifetime Whenever a C++ variable, allocated on the stack, goes out of scope it gets destructed. Remember that in C++ you can create objects on the stack or on the heap. When you create them on the stack, once execution leaves the scope, they get popped off the stack and gets destroyed. BIGBLOCK When C++ objects are created on the heap, they must be explicitly destroyed, otherwise it is a memory leak. No such problem with stack variables though. C# Object Lifetime In CLR, objects (i.e. reference types) are <strong>always</strong> created on the managed heap. This is further reinforced by object creation syntax. Consider this code snippet. BIGBLOCK In C++ this would create an instance on <code>MyClass</code> on the stack and call its default constructor. In C# it would create a reference to class <code>MyClass</code> that doesn't point to anything. The only way to create an instance of a class is by using <code>new</code> operator: BIGBLOCK In a way, C# objects are a lot like objects that are created using <code>new</code> syntax in C++ - they are created on the heap but unlike C++ objects, they are managed by the runtime, so you don't have to worry about destructing them. Since the objects are <strong>always</strong> on the heap the fact that object references (i.e. pointers) go out of scope becomes moot. There are more factors involved in determining if an object is to be collected than simply presence of references to the object. C# Object references Jon Skeet compared object references in Java to pieces of string that are attached to the balloon, which is the object. Same analogy applies to C# object references. They simply point to a location of the heap that contains the object. Thus, setting it to null has no immediate effect on the object lifetime, the balloon continues to exist, until the GC ""pops"" it. Continuing down the balloon analogy, it would seem logical that once the balloon has no strings attached to it, it can be destroyed. In fact this is exactly how reference counted objects work in non-managed languages. Except this approach doesn't work for circular references very well. Imagine two balloons that are attached together by a string but neither balloon has a string to anything else. Under simple ref counting rules, they both continue to exist, even though the whole balloon group is ""orphaned"". .NET objects are a lot like helium balloons under a roof. When the roof opens (GC runs) - the unused balloons float away, even though there might be groups of balloons that are tethered together. .NET GC uses a combination of generational GC and mark and sweep. Generational approach involves the runtime favouring to inspect objects that have been allocated most recently, as they are more likely to be unused and mark and sweep involves runtime going through the whole object graph and working out if there are object groups that are unused. This adequately deals with circular dependency problem. Also, .NET GC runs on another thread(so called finalizer thread) as it has quite a bit to do and doing that on the main thread would interrupt your program.","In C#, objects are managed by the Garbage Collector (GC) and do not require manual disposal or setting to null. The GC automatically collects objects that are no longer in use. However, objects that implement `IDisposable` should have their `Dispose` method called when finished using them, typically through a `using` block. 

Variable scope in C# is different from C++ in that variables cannot be redefined in a nested block, and all variables are defined at the function level. Objects in C# are always created on the managed heap and are managed by the runtime, eliminating the need for manual destruction.

I've come across some very hard to find issues that were the direct result of not following the advice above. A good place to do this is in Dispose(), but sooner is usually better. In general, if a reference exists to an object the garbage collector (GC) may take a couple of generations longer to figure out that an object is no longer in use. All the while the object remains in memory. That may not be a problem until you find that your app is using a lot more memory than you'd expect. When that happens, hook up a memory profiler to see what objects are not being cleaned up.

2926869,Do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null?,"As others have said you definitely want to call <code>Dispose</code> if the class implements <code>IDisposable</code>. I take a fairly rigid position on this. Some might claim that calling <code>Dispose</code> on <code>DataSet</code>, for example, is pointless because they disassembled it and saw that it did not do anything meaningful. But, I think there are fallacies abound in that argument. Read this for an interesting debate by respected individuals on the subject. Then read my reasoning here why I think Jeffery Richter is in the wrong camp. Now, on to whether or not you should set a reference to <code>null</code>. The answer is no. Let me illustrate my point with the following code. BIGBLOCK So when do you think the object referenced by <code>a</code> is eligible for collection? If you said after the call to <code>a = null</code> then you are wrong. If you said after the <code>Main</code> method completes then you are also wrong. The correct answer is that it is eligible for collection sometime <strong>during</strong> the call to <code>DoSomething</code>. That is right. It is eligible <strong>before</strong> the reference is set to <code>null</code> and perhaps even before the call to <code>DoSomething</code> completes. That is because the JIT compiler can recognize when object references are no longer dereferenced even if they are still rooted.","To properly dispose of objects, it's essential to call `Dispose` if the class implements `IDisposable`. However, setting the object reference to `null` is not necessary, as the object becomes eligible for garbage collection when it's no longer referenced, which can occur before the reference is explicitly set to `null`. The JIT compiler can detect when object references are no longer used, even if they are still rooted, making the manual setting to `null` unnecessary.",That is because the JIT compiler can recognize when object references are no longer dereferenced even if they are still rooted.,"Some might claim that calling <code>Dispose</code> on <code>DataSet</code>, for example, is pointless because they disassembled it and saw that it did not do anything meaningful.

In most cases ""singletonity"" is a detail of implementation for some class rather than characteristic of its interface. Inversion of Control Container may hide this characteristic from class users; you just need to mark your class as a singleton (with <code>@Singleton</code> annotation in Java for example) and that's it; IoCC will do the rest. You don't need to provide global access to your singleton instance because the access is already managed by IoCC. Thus there is nothing wrong with IoC Singletons. GoF Singletons in opposite to IoC Singletons are supposed to expose ""singletonity"" in the interface through getInstance() method, and so that they suffer from everything said above.","The issue with singletons lies not with the concept itself, but with how they are implemented. Traditional singletons, as described in the Gang of Four (GoF) pattern, expose their singleton nature through a global access point, such as a `getInstance()` method, which can lead to various problems. In contrast, singletons managed by an Inversion of Control Container (IoCC) do not expose their singleton nature and instead have their instantiation and access managed by the container, making them less problematic. This distinction highlights that the criticism of singletons primarily targets the traditional, globally accessible implementation rather than the concept of having a single instance of","GoF Singletons in opposite to IoC Singletons are supposed to expose ""singletonity"" in the interface through getInstance() method, and so that they suffer from everything said above.",
2926869,Do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null?,"Always call dispose. It is not worth the risk. Big managed enterprise applications should be treated with respect. No assumptions can be made or else it will come back to bite you. Don't listen to leppie. A lot of objects don't actually implement IDisposable, so you don't have to worry about them. If they genuinely go out of scope they will be freed automatically. Also I have never come across the situation where I have had to set something to null. One thing that can happen is that a lot of objects can be held open. This can greatly increase the memory usage of your application. Sometimes it is hard to work out whether this is actually a memory leak, or whether your application is just doing a lot of stuff. Memory profile tools can help with things like that, but it can be tricky. In addition always unsubscribe from events that are not needed. Also be careful with WPF binding and controls. Not a usual situation, but I came across a situation where I had a WPF control that was being bound to an underlying object. The underlying object was large and took up a large amount of memory. The WPF control was being replaced with a new instance, and the old one was still hanging around for some reason. This caused a large memory leak. In hindsite the code was poorly written, but the point is that you want to make sure that things that are not used go out of scope. That one took a long time to find with a memory profiler as it is hard to know what stuff in memory is valid, and what shouldn't be there.","To manage objects and memory effectively, it's crucial to always call dispose on objects that implement IDisposable to avoid potential risks, especially in large enterprise applications. However, not all objects require this, as those that don't implement IDisposable will be automatically freed when they go out of scope. Setting objects to null is generally not necessary. Key considerations include:

1. **Dispose of Objects**: Always call dispose on objects that implement IDisposable to prevent memory leaks and other issues.
2. **Unsubscribe from Events**: Regularly unsubscribe from events that are no longer needed to prevent objects from being unnecessarily held in memory.

It does not use advanced arithmetic (multiplication, division, %), memory fetches (way too slow), branches (way too slow), but it does assume the CPU has a 32-bit barrel shifter (in other words, >> 1 and >> 32 take the same amount of cycles.) It assumes that small constants (such as 6, 12, 24) cost nothing to load into the registers, or are stored in temporaries and reused over and over again. With these assumptions, it counts 32 bits in about 16 cycles/instructions on most RISC machines. Note that 15 instructions/cycles is close to a lower bound on the number of cycles or instructions, because it seems to take at least 3 instructions (mask, shift, operator) to cut the number of addends in half, so log_2(32) = 5, 5 x 3 = 15 instructions is a quasi-lowerbound. Here is a secret to the first and most complex step: so if I take the 1st column (A) above, shift it right 1 bit, and subtract it from AB, I get the output (CD). The extension to 3 bits is similar; you can check it with an 8-row boolean table like mine above if you wish.

HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and    password so that it can verify that you're allowed to do the request you're    doing. The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by    default) is plain text based, which means it sends username and password    only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on    the network between you and the remote server. To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication: The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers    returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even    --anyauth might be options that suit you. Sometimes your HTTP access is only available through the use of a HTTP    proxy. This seems to be especially common at various companies. A HTTP proxy    may require its own user and password to allow the client to get through to    the Internet. To specify those with curl, run something like: If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,    use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest. If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password    part, curl will prompt for the password interactively. Do note that when a program is run, its parameters might be possible to see    when listing the running processes of the system. Thus, other users may be    able to watch your passwords if you pass them as plain command line    options. There are ways to circumvent this. It is worth noting that while this is how HTTP Authentication works, very    many web sites will not use this concept when they provide logins etc. See    the Web Login chapter further below for more details on that.","To set the authorization header using curl, you can use the following options:

* For Basic authentication: `-u` or `--user` followed by `username:password`
* For NTLM authentication: `--ntlm`
* For Digest authentication: `--digest`
* For Negotiate authentication: `--negotiate`
* For any authentication: `--anyauth`

You can also specify a proxy and its authentication method using options such as `--proxy-ntlm` or `--proxy-digest`. If you leave out the password, curl will prompt for it interactively.

The explicit OO way of calling them, prevents the conflicts, so point a. is not an issue   b. Singletons without state are (like factories) are not a problem. Singletons with state can again fall in two categories, those which are immutable or write once and read many (config/property files). These are not bad.

A defeat in monopoly is hard to swallow because, monopoly is about money, if you lose you have to painstakingly watch the rest of the players finish the game, and losses are usually swift and crushing.

You're swiftly building your empire and consuming market share at an exponential rate. Your opponents are weakening and you start to smell blood (figuratively). Your buddy Bob put all of his money into gridlocking as many low-value properties as possible but his isn't receiving a high return on investment the way he expected. Bob, as a stroke of bad luck, lands on your Boardwalk and is excised from the game. Now the game goes from friendly dice-rolling to serious business. Bob has been made the example of failure and Joe and Ed don't want to end up like 'that guy'. So, being the leading player you, all of a sudden, become the enemy. Joe and Ed start practicing under-the-table trades, behind-the-back money injections, undervalued house-swapping and generally anything to weaken you as a player until one of them rises to the top. Then, instead of one of them winning, the process starts all over. All of a sudden, a finite set of rules becomes a moving target and the game degenerates into the type of social interactions that would make up the foundation of every high-rated reality TV show since Survivor. Why, because the rules are changing and there's no consensus on how/why/what they're supposed to represent, and more importantly, there's no one person making the decisions. Every player in the game, at that point, is making his/her own rules and chaos ensues until two of the players are too tired to keep up the charade and slowly give up. So, if a rulebook for a game accurately represented a singleton, the monopoly rulebook would be an example of abuse. How does this apply to programming? Aside from all of the obvious thread-safety and synchronization issues that mutable singletons present... If you have one set of data, that is capable of being read/manipulated by multiple different sources concurrently and exists during the lifetime of the application execution, it's probably a good time to step back and ask ""am I using the right type of data structure here"". Personally, I have seen a programmer abuse a singleton by using it as some sort of twisted cross-thread database store within an application. Having worked on the code directly, I can attest that it was a slow (because of all the thread locks needed to make it thread-safe) and a nightmare to work on (because of the unpredictable/intermittent nature of synchronization bugs), and nearly impossible to test under 'production' conditions. Sure, a system could have been developed using polling/signaling to overcome some of the performance issues but that wouldn't solve the issues with testing and, why bother when a 'real' database can already accomplish the same functionality in a much more robust/scalable manner. A Singleton is only an option if you need what a singleton provides. A write-one read-only instance of an object. That same rule should cascade to the object's properties/members as well.","The problem with singletons is not the pattern itself, but rather the misuse of it, particularly when it comes to mutable state. Singletons with non-readonly or mutable state can lead to issues such as namespace conflicts, exposed state, and thread-safety problems. The analogy of a game of Monopoly is used to illustrate how a set of rules (or a singleton) can become corrupted and lead to chaos when multiple players (or threads) try to modify it concurrently. In programming, mutable singletons can cause problems such as slow performance, synchronization issues, and difficulties in testing. The author suggests that singletons should only be used when",When it comes to Singletons,Monopoly is the devil and singletons with non-readonly/mutable state are the 'real' problem...

3141087,"What is meant with ""const"" at end of function declaration?","A ""const function"", denoted with the keyword <code>const</code> after a function declaration, makes it a compiler error for this class function to change a member variable of the class. However, reading of a class variables is ok inside of the function, but writing inside of this function will generate a compiler error. Another way of thinking about such ""const function"" is by viewing an class function as a normal function taking an implicit <code>this</code> pointer. So a method <code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg)</code> (without the const at the end) results in a function like <code>int Foo_Bar(Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>, and a call such as <code>Foo f; f.Bar(4)</code> will internally correspond to something like <code>Foo f; Foo_Bar(&amp;f, 4)</code>. Now adding the const at the end (<code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg) const</code>) can then be understood as a declaration with a const this pointer: <code>int Foo_Bar(const Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>. Since the type of <code>this</code> in such case is const, no modifications of member variables are possible. It is possible to loosen the ""const function"" restriction of not allowing the function to write to any variable of a class. To allow some of the variables to be writable even when the function is marked as a ""const function"", these class variables are marked with the keyword <code>mutable</code>. Thus, if a class variable is marked as mutable, and a ""const function"" writes to this variable then the code will compile cleanly and the variable is possible to change. (C++11) As usual when dealing with the <code>const</code> keyword, changing the location of the const key word in a C++ statement has entirely different meanings. The above usage of <code>const</code> only apply when adding <code>const</code> to the end of the function declaration after the parenthesis. <code>const</code> is a highly overused qualifier in C++ and the syntax and ordering is often not straightforward in combination with pointers. Some readings about <code>const</code> correctness and the <code>const</code> keyword: Const correctness The C++ 'const' Declaration: Why &amp; How","In C++, adding the `const` keyword at the end of a function declaration makes it a ""const function"", which means the function cannot modify any member variables of the class.

The `const` keyword has different meanings depending on its location in a statement, and its usage can be complex, especially when combined with pointers.",,"A ""const function"", denoted with the keyword <code>const</code> after a function declaration, makes it a compiler error for this class function to change a member variable of the class."

487258,"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?","Big O notation is a way of describing the upper bound of an algorithm in terms of space or running time. The n is the number of elements in the the problem (i.e size of an array, number of nodes in a tree, etc.) We are interested in describing the running time as n gets  big. When we say some algorithm is O(f(n)) we are saying that the running time (or space required) by that algorithm is always lower than some constant times f(n). To say that binary search has a running time of O(logn) is to say that there exists some constant c which you can multiply log(n) by that will always be larger than the running time of binary search. In this case you will always have some constant factor of log(n) comparisons. In other words where g(n) is the running time of your algorithm, we say that g(n) = O(f(n)) when g(n) &lt;= c*f(n) when n > k, where c and k are some constants.","Here's a summary:

Big O notation measures how long an algorithm takes to run or how much space it uses, relative to the size of the problem (n). It's an upper limit, meaning the algorithm's running time or space usage will always be less than or equal to a constant times a given function (f(n)). For example, if an algorithm is O(log n), it means its running time grows logarithmically with the size of the problem, and there's a constant factor that bounds its performance.",Big O notation is a way of describing the upper bound of an algorithm in terms of space or running time.

3295496,What is a JavaBean exactly?,"A JavaBean is just a standard All properties private (use getters/setters) A public no-argument constructor Implements <code>Serializable</code>. That's it. It's just a convention. Lots of libraries depend on it though. With respect to <code>Serializable</code>, from the API documentation: Serializability of a class is enabled by the class implementing the   java.io.Serializable interface. Classes that do not implement this   interface will not have any of their state serialized or deserialized.   All subtypes of a serializable class are themselves serializable. The   serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to   identify the semantics of being serializable. In other words, serializable objects can be written to streams, and hence files, object databases, anything really. Also, there is no syntactic difference between a JavaBean and another class -- a class defines a JavaBean if it follows the standards. There is a term for it because the standard allows libraries to programmatically do things with class instances you define in a predefined way. For example, if a library wants to stream any object you pass into it, it knows it can because your object is serializable (assuming the lib requires your objects be proper JavaBeans).","A JavaBean is a Java class that follows a specific convention, which includes: 

1. Making all properties private and using getters and setters to access them.
2. Having a public no-argument constructor.
3. Implementing the `Serializable` interface, allowing the class to be written to streams and files.

This convention enables libraries to work with JavaBean instances in a standardized way, such as serializing and deserializing their state. There is no syntactic difference between a JavaBean and another Java class, but following this convention allows for greater flexibility and compatibility with various libraries.",,"A JavaBean is just a standard All properties private (use getters/setters) A public no-argument constructor Implements <code>Serializable</code>.

3295496,What is a JavaBean exactly?,"There's a term for it to make it sound special. The reality is nowhere near so mysterious. Basically, a ""Bean"": is a serializable object (that is, it implements <code>java.io.Serializable</code>, and does so correctly), that has ""properties"" whose getters and setters are just methods with certain names (like, say, <code>getFoo()</code> is the getter for the ""Foo"" property), and has a public default constructor (so it can be created at will and configured by setting its properties). Update: As for <code>Serializable</code>:  That is nothing but a ""marker interface"" (an interface that doesn't declare any functions) that tells Java that the implementing class consents to (and implies that it is capable of) ""serialization"" -- a process that converts an instance into a stream of bytes. Those bytes can be stored in files, sent over a network connection, etc, and have enough info to allow a JVM (at least, one that knows about the object's type) to reconstruct the object later -- possibly in a different instance of the application, or even on a whole other machine! Of course, in order to do that, the class has to abide by certain limitations. Chief among them is that all instance fields must be either primitive types (int, bool, etc), instances of some class that is also serializable, or marked as <code>transient</code> so that Java won't try to include them. (This of course means that <code>transient</code> fields will not survive the trip over a stream. A class that has <code>transient</code> fields should be prepared to reinitialize them if necessary.) A class that can not abide by those limitations should not implement <code>Serializable</code> (and, IIRC, the Java compiler won't even let it do so.)","A JavaBean is a simple Java class that follows certain conventions: 

1. It is serializable, meaning it implements `java.io.Serializable` and can be converted into a stream of bytes.
2. It has properties with getter and setter methods with specific names (e.g., `getFoo()` and `setFoo()`).
3. It has a public default constructor, allowing it to be created and configured easily.

3463426,"In C, how should I read a text file and print all strings","Two approaches leap to mind. First, don't use <code>scanf</code>. Use <code>fgets()</code> which takes a parameter to specify the buffer size, and which leaves any newline characters intact. A simple loop over the file that prints the buffer content should naturally copy the file intact. Second, use <code>fread()</code> or the common C idiom with <code>fgetc()</code>. These would process the file in fixed-size chunks or a single character at a time. If you must process the file over white-space delimited strings, then use either <code>fgets</code> or <code>fread</code> to read the file, and something like <code>strtok</code> to split the buffer at whitespace. Don't forget to handle the transition from one buffer to the next, since your target strings are likely to span the buffer boundary. If there is an external requirement to use <code>scanf</code> to do the reading, then limit the length of the string it might read with a precision field in the format specifier. In your case with a 999 byte buffer, then say <code>scanf(""%998s"", str);</code> which will write at most 998 characters to the buffer leaving room for the nul terminator. If single strings longer than your buffer are allowed, then you would have to process them in two pieces.

3477333,What is the difference between POST and GET?,"<code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> are two different types of HTTP requests. According to Wikipedia: GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. and POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616) section 9 Method Definitions contains more information on <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> as well as the other HTTP methods, if you are interested. In addition to explaining the intended uses of each method, the spec also provides at least one practical reason for why <code>GET</code> should only be used to retrieve data: Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing servers, proxies, and user agents will log the request URI in some place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use POST-based form submission instead Finally, an important consideration when using <code>GET</code> for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a <code>GET</code> request. So if you, for example, poll using the same <code>GET</code> request you will always get back the same results, even if the data you are querying is being updated server-side. One way to alleviate this problem is to make the URL unique for each request by appending a timestamp.","The main difference between HTTP requests `GET` and `POST` is their purpose: `GET` is used to retrieve remote data, while `POST` is used to insert or update remote data. `GET` should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, as it may be used by robots or crawlers, and sensitive data should not be submitted using `GET` as it can be logged and visible to third parties.

667781,What is the difference between MVC and MVVM?,"MVC/MVVM is not an either/or choice. The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development. For ASP.Net, MVVM is used to two-way bind data within views. This is usually a client-side implementation (e.g. using Knockout.js). MVC on the other hand is a way of separating concerns on the server-side. For Silverlight and WPF, the MVVM pattern is more encompassing and can appear to act as a replacement for MVC (or other patterns of organising software into separate responsibilities). One assumption, that frequently came out of this pattern, was that the <code>ViewModel</code> simply replaced the controller in <code>MVC</code> (as if you could just  substitute <code>VM</code> for <code>C</code> in the acronym and all would be forgiven)... The ViewModel does not necessarily replace the need for separate Controllers. The problem is: that to be independently testable*, and especially reusable when needed, a view-model has no idea what view is displaying it, but more importantly no idea where its data is coming from. *Note: in practice Controllers remove most of the logic, from the ViewModel, that requires unit testing. The VM then becomes a dumb container that requires little, if any, testing. This is a good thing as the VM is just a bridge, between the designer and the coder, so should be kept simple. Even in MVVM, controllers will typically contain all processing logic and decide what data to display in which views using which view models. From what we have seen so far the main benefit of the ViewModel pattern to remove code from XAML code-behind to make XAML editing a more independent task. We still create controllers, as and when needed, to control (no pun intended) the overall logic of our applications. The basic MVCVM guidelines we follow are: Views display a certain shape of data. They have no idea where the data comes from. ViewModels hold a certain shape of data and commands, they do not know where the data, or code, comes from or how it is displayed. Models hold the actual data (various context, store or other methods) Controllers listen for, and publish, events. Controllers provide the logic that controls what data is seen and where. Controllers provide the command code to the ViewModel so that the ViewModel is actually reusable. We also noted that the Sculpture code-gen framework implements MVVM and a pattern similar to Prism AND it also makes extensive use of controllers to separate all use-case logic. Don't assume controllers are made obsolete by View-models. I have started a blog on this topic which I will add to as and when I can. There are issues with combining MVCVM with the common navigation systems, as most navigation systems just use Views and VMs, but I will go into that in later articles. An additional benefit of using an MVCVM model is that only the controller objects need to exist in memory for the life of the application and the controllers contain mainly code and little state data (i.e. tiny memory overhead). This makes for much less memory-intensive apps than solutions where view-models have to be retained and it is ideal for certain types of mobile development (e.g. Windows Mobile using Silverlight/Prism/MEF). This does of course depend on the type of application as you may still need to retain the occasional cached VMs for responsiveness. Note: This post has been edited numerous times, and did not specifically target the narrow question asked, so I have updated the first part to now cover that too. Much of the discussion, in comments below, relates only to ASP.Net and not the broader picture. This post was intended to cover the broader use of MVVM in Silverlight, WPF and ASP.Net and try avoid people replacing controllers with ViewModels.","The main difference between MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is not a replacement, but rather a complementary approach.

Once the last reply has arrived, the only thing to be done is to remove its identifier from the set, which in typical implementations takes <code>O(log k+1)</code>. After that, the set contains the list of <code>k</code> missing elements and there's no additional processing to be done. This certainly isn't the fastest approach for batch processing pre-generated bags of numbers because the whole thing runs <code>O((log 1 + log 2 + ... + log n) + (log n + log n-1 + ... + log k))</code>. But it does work for any value of <code>k</code> (even if it's not known ahead of time) and in the example above it was applied in a way that minimizes the most critical interval.","The question of finding a missing number between 1 and 100 can be approached differently depending on the context of the problem. Instead of a straightforward set-based solution, the interviewer's goal might be to find the missing number(s) in real-time, as part of a larger process. A more efficient approach involves using a set to keep track of sent messages and removing them as replies arrive, allowing for quick identification of missing elements once all replies have been received. This method, although not the fastest for batch processing, is adaptable to any number of missing elements and can minimize critical intervals in certain scenarios.",That time can be put to use inserting some identifying facet of each sent message into a set and deleting it as each corresponding reply arrives.,"Depending on the problem and the requirements surrounding it, the obvious set-based solution might be the right thing and the generate-a-list-and-pick-through-it-afterward approach might not.

3642919,javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException: View could not be restored,"Introduction The <code>ViewExpiredException</code> will be thrown whenever the <code>javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD</code> is set to <code>server</code> (default) and the enduser sends a HTTP POST request on a view via <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;h:commandLink&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h:commandButton&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;f:ajax&gt;</code>, while the associated view state isn't available in the session anymore. The view state is identified as value of a hidden input field <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> of the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code>. With the state saving method set to <code>server</code>, this contains only the view state ID which references a serialized view state in the session. So, when the session is expired for some reason (either timed out in server or client side, or the session cookie is not maintained anymore for some reason in browser, or by calling <code>HttpSession#invalidate()</code> in server, or due a server specific bug with session cookies as known in WildFly), then the serialized view state is not available anymore in the session and the enduser will get this exception. To understand the working of the session, see also How do servlets work? Instantiation, sessions, shared variables and multithreading. There is also a limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session. When the limit is hit, then the least recently used view will be expired. See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. With the state saving method set to <code>client</code>, the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden input field contains instead the whole serialized view state, so the enduser won't get a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when the session expires. It can however still happen on a cluster environment (""ERROR: MAC did not verify"" is symptomatic) and/or when there's a implementation-specific timeout on the client side state configured and/or when server re-generates the AES key during restart, see also Getting ViewExpiredException in clustered environment while state saving method is set to client and user session is valid how to solve it. Regardless of the solution, make sure you do not use <code>enableRestoreView11Compatibility</code>. it does not at all restore the original view state. It basically recreates the view and all associated view scoped beans from scratch and hereby thus losing all of original data (state). As the application will behave in a confusing way (""Hey, where are my input values..?? ""), this is very bad for user experience. Better use stateless views or <code>&lt;o:enableRestorableView&gt;</code> instead so you can manage it on a specific view only instead of on all views. As to the why JSF needs to save view state, head to this answer: Why JSF saves the state of UI components on server? Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page navigation In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when e.g. navigating back after logout when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, only redirecting the POST request after logout is not sufficient. You also need to instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, otherwise the browser may show them from the cache instead of requesting a fresh one from the server when you send a GET request on it (e.g. by back button). The <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field of the cached page may contain a view state ID value which is not valid anymore in the current session. If you're (ab)using POST (command links/buttons) instead of GET (regular links/buttons) for page-to-page navigation, and click such a command link/button on the cached page, then this will in turn fail with a <code>ViewExpiredException</code>. To fire a redirect after logout in JSF 2.0, either add <code>&lt;redirect /&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;navigation-case&gt;</code> in question (if any), or add <code>?faces-redirect=true</code> to the <code>outcome</code> value. or To instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, create a <code>Filter</code> which is mapped on the servlet name of the <code>FacesServlet</code> and adds the needed response headers to disable the browser cache. E.g. Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page refresh In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when refreshing the current page when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, you not only need to make sure you are performing page-to-page navigation exclusively by GET (regular links/buttons), but you also need to make sure that you are exclusively using ajax to submit the forms. If you're submitting the form synchronously (non-ajax) anyway, then you'd best either make the view stateless (see later section), or to send a redirect after POST (see previous section). Having a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> on page refresh is in default configuration a very rare case. It can only happen when the limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session is hit. So, it will only happen when you've manually set that limit way too low, or that you're continuously creating new views in background (e.g. by a badly implemented poll). See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. Another cause is having duplicate JSF libraries in runtime classpath conflicting each other. The correct procedure to install JSF is outlined in our JSF wiki page. Handling ViewExpiredException When you want to handle an unavoidable <code>ViewExpiredException</code> after a POST action on an arbitrary page which was already opened in some browser tab/window while you're logged out in another tab/window, then you'd like to specify an <code>error-page</code> for that in <code>web.xml</code> which goes to a ""Your session is timed out"" page. E.g. Use if necessary a meta refresh header in the error page in case you intend to actually redirect further to home or login page. (the <code>0</code> in <code>content</code> represents the amount of seconds before redirect, <code>0</code> thus means ""redirect immediately"", you can use e.g. <code>3</code> to let the browser wait 3 seconds with the redirect) Note that handling exceptions during ajax requests requires a special <code>ExceptionHandler</code>. See also Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request. You can find a live example at OmniFaces <code>FullAjaxExceptionHandler</code> showcase page (this also covers non-ajax requests). Also note that your ""general"" error page should be mapped on <code>&lt;error-code&gt;</code> of <code>500</code> instead of an <code>&lt;exception-type&gt;</code> of e.g. <code>java.lang.Exception</code> or <code>java.lang.Throwable</code>, otherwise all exceptions wrapped in <code>ServletException</code> such as <code>ViewExpiredException</code> would still end up in the general error page. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml. Stateless views A completely different alternative is to run JSF views in stateless mode. This way nothing of JSF state will be saved and the views will never expire, but just be rebuilt from scratch on every request. You can turn on stateless views by setting the <code>transient</code> attribute of <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>: This way the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field will get a fixed value of <code>""stateless""</code> in Mojarra (have not checked MyFaces at this point). Note that this feature was introduced in Mojarra 2.1.19 and 2.2.0 and is not available in older versions. The consequence is that you cannot use view scoped beans anymore. They will now behave like request scoped beans. One of the disadvantages is that you have to track the state yourself by fiddling with hidden inputs and/or loose request parameters. Mainly those forms with input fields with <code>rendered</code>, <code>readonly</code> or <code>disabled</code> attributes which are controlled by ajax events will be affected. Note that the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> does not necessarily need to be unique throughout the view and/or reside in the master template only. It's also completely legit to redeclare and nest it in a template client. It basically ""extends"" the parent <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> then. E.g. in master template: and in template client: You can even wrap the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;c:if&gt;</code> to make it conditional. Note that it would apply on the entire view, not only on the nested contents, such as the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> in above example. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml Check if session exists JSF Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request Unrelated to the concrete problem, using HTTP POST for pure page-to-page navigation isn't very user/SEO friendly. In JSF 2.0 you should really prefer <code>&lt;h:link&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h:button&gt;</code> over the <code>&lt;h:commandXxx&gt;</code> ones for plain vanilla page-to-page navigation.

While it is nice to separate the UI from business and interaction logic, the 'pure' MVVM pattern and most available examples work best on singular views. Not sure about your designs, but most of my applications, however, contain pages and several (reusable) views and thus the ViewModels do need to interact to some degree. Using the page as controller would defeat the purpose of the MVVM altogether, so not using a ""VM-C"" approach for the underlying logic might result in .. well .. challenging constructs as the application matures. Even in VB-6 most of us probably stopped coding business logic into the Button event and started 'relaying' commands to a controller, right?

Happy coding! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel#References","The key difference between MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is that MVVM is more suitable for singular views, whereas MVC can handle more complex applications with multiple views and pages.

890128,Why are Python lambdas useful?,"As stated above, the lambda operator in Python defines an anonymous function, and in Python functions are closures. It is important not to confuse the concept of closures with the operator lambda, which is merely syntactic methadone for them. When I started in Python a few years ago, I used lambdas a lot, thinking they were cool, along with list comprehensions. However, I wrote and have to maintain a big website written in Python, with on the order of several thousand function points. I've learnt from experience that lambdas might be OK to prototype things with, but offer nothing over inline functions (named closures) except for saving a few key-stokes, or sometimes not. Basically this boils down to several points: it is easier to read software that is explicitly written using meaningful names. Anonymous closures by definition cannot have a meaningful name, as they have no name. This brevity seems, for some reason, to also infect lambda parameters, hence we often see examples like lambda x: x+1 it is easier to reuse named closures, as they can be referred to by name more than once, when there is a name to refer to them by. it is easier to debug code that is using named closures instead of lambdas, because the name will appear in tracebacks, and around the error. That's enough reason to round them up and convert them to named closures. However, I hold two other grudges against anonymous closures. The first grudge is simply that they are just another unnecessary keyword cluttering up the language. The second grudge is deeper and on the paradigm level, i.e. I do not like that they promote a functional-programming style, because that style is less flexible than the message passing, object oriented or procedural styles, because the lambda calculus is not Turing-complete (luckily in Python, we can still break out of that restriction even inside a lambda). The reasons I feel lambdas promote this style are: There is an implicit return, i.e. they seem like they 'should' be functions. They are an alternative state-hiding mechanism to another, more explicit, more readable, more reusable and more general mechanism: methods. I try hard to write lambda-free Python, and remove lambdas on sight. I think Python would be a slightly better language without lambdas, but that's just my opinion.","The author believes that Python lambdas are not as useful as they seem. While they can be used to define small, anonymous functions, they lack readability, reusability, and debugability compared to named closures. The author argues that lambdas promote a functional programming style that is less flexible than other paradigms and can make code harder to understand and maintain.

In my case there are many objects with the same identifier 0, because they are new and don't have one. The db generates them. Somewhere I have read that 0 signals Id not set.

But You can't do that - ""Of course You should know that hibernate works this and that way, therefore You have to.."" So now I can try to change Ids to Long instead of long and look if it then works. In the end it's easier to do it with a simple mapper by your own, because hibernate is just an additional intransparent burden. Another example: Trying to read parameters from one database and persist them in another forces you to do nearly all work manually. But if you have to do it anyway, using hibernate is just additional work.","The author encountered a `NonUniqueObjectException` in Hibernate due to multiple new objects having an identifier of 0, which is supposed to indicate an unset ID.

They suggest that using a simple custom mapper might be a more efficient approach than using Hibernate.","But if you have to do it anyway, using hibernate is just additional work.",

4062001,CSS3 Border Opacity?,"Unfortunately the <code>opacity</code> element makes the whole element (including any text) semi-transparent. The best way to make the border semi-transparent is with the rgba color format. For example, this would give a red border with 50% opacity: The problem with this approach is that some browsers do not understand the <code>rgba</code> format and will not display any border at all if this is the entire declaration. The solution is to provide two border declarations. The first with a fake opacity, and the second with the actual. If a browser is capable, it will use the second, if not, it will use the first. The first border declaration will be the equivalent color to a 50% opaque red border over a white background (although any graphics under the border will not bleed through). UPDATE: I've added ""background-clip: padding-box;"" to this answer (per  SooDesuNe's suggestion in the comments) to ensure the border remains transparent even if a solid background color is applied.","To achieve a semi-transparent border in CSS3, use the `rgba` color format, but provide a fallback declaration for browsers that don't support it.

It was baffling! Turns out, I let a variable go out of scope and the garbage collector swept it away and then I tried to use it. Thus the seemingly-random timing. To give a more concrete example... Inside a method, I had something like: Now in my JSP page, I called that method and used the List object returned by it. The List object is backed by that ""foos"" array; but, the array went out of scope when I returned from the method (since it is a local variable). So shortly after returning, the garbage collector swept away the ""foos"" array, and my access to the List caused a NullPointerException since its underlying array was now wiped away. I actually wondered, as I wrote the above method, whether that would happen. The even deeper underlying problem was premature optimization. I wanted a list, but I knew I would have exactly 20 elements, so I figured I'd try to be more efficient than <code>new ArrayList&lt;Foo&gt;(20)</code> which only sets an initial size of 20 but can possibly be less efficient than the method I used.

529085,How to create a generic array in Java?,"Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): That compiles without warnings, and as you can see in <code>main</code>, for whatever type you declare an instance of <code>GenSet</code> as, you can assign <code>a</code> to an array of that type, and you can assign an element from <code>a</code> to a variable of that type, meaning that the array and the values in the array are of the correct type. It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials. Class literals are treated by the compiler as instances of <code>java.lang.Class</code>. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with <code>.class</code>. So, <code>String.class</code> acts as a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>. This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. <code>String[].class</code>), primitives (e.g. <code>int.class</code>), and the keyword <code>void</code> (i.e. <code>void.class</code>). <code>Class</code> itself is generic (declared as <code>Class&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> stands for the type that the <code>Class</code> object is representing), meaning that the type of <code>String.class</code> is <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>. So, whenever you call the constructor for <code>GenSet</code>, you pass in a class literal for the first argument representing an array of the <code>GenSet</code> instance's declared type (e.g. <code>String[].class</code> for <code>GenSet&lt;String&gt;</code>). Note that you won't be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can't be used for type variables. Inside the constructor, calling the method <code>cast</code> returns the passed <code>Object</code> argument cast to the class represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called. Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument. Calling the method <code>getComponentType</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the component type of the array represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called (e.g. <code>String.class</code> for <code>String[].class</code>, <code>null</code> if the <code>Class</code> object doesn't represent an array). That last sentence isn't entirely accurate. Calling <code>String[].class.getComponentType()</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>, but its type is <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, not <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>, which is why you can't do something like the following. Same goes for every method in <code>Class</code> that returns a <code>Class</code> object. Regarding Joachim Sauer's comment on this answer (I don't have enough reputation to comment on it myself), the example using the cast to <code>T[]</code> will result in a warning because the compiler can't guarantee type safety in that case. Edit regarding Ingo's comments:","To create a generic array in Java, you can use class literals as runtime type tokens. This involves passing a class literal, such as `String[].class`, to a constructor or method, which can then use the `java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance` method to create an array of the desired type. The `Class` object is generic, allowing for type safety, but note that you cannot create an array of primitives. The `getComponentType` method returns a `Class` object representing the component type of the array, but its type is `Class<?>`, not `Class<T>`. This approach avoids warnings and ensures type safety,",,"Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials.

The <code>!=</code> operator means ""not equal"". 0 stands for false, and anything else stands for true. So what happens is, we call the <code>getchar()</code> function, and compare the result to -1 (EOF).

It is during this evaluation when the <code>attr_accessor</code> method is invoked which in turn modifies the current class - remember the implicit receiver: <code>self.attr_accessor</code>, where <code>self</code> is the ""open"" class object at this point. The need for <code>attr_accessor</code> and friends, is, well: Ruby, like Smalltalk, does not allow instance variables to be accessed outside of methods1 for that object. That is, instance variables cannot be accessed in the <code>x.y</code> form as is common in say, Java or even Python.

We didn't create the writer yet so let's do that. Awesome. Now we can write and read instance variable <code>@name</code> using reader and writer methods. Except, this is done so frequently, why waste time writing these methods every time? We can do it easier. Even this can get repetitive. When you want both reader and writer just use accessor! Works the same way! And guess what: the instance variable <code>@name</code> in our person object will be set just like when we did it manually, so you can use it in other methods. That's it. In order to understand how <code>attr_reader</code>, <code>attr_writer</code>, and <code>attr_accessor</code> methods actually generate methods for you, read other answers, books, ruby docs.","In Ruby, `attr_accessor` is a method that automatically generates both reader and writer methods for an instance variable, allowing you to access and modify its value. It is a shortcut for manually defining separate reader and writer methods, making it a convenient and efficient way to create getter and setter methods for instance variables in a class.",Those are two different methods.

Arguably, interface implementation serves polymorphic needs ""Better"" than inheritance.","Polymorphism simply means ""Many Forms"". So, since interfaces describe behavior, and method names describe behavior (to the programmer), it is not too far of a stretch to consider method overloading as a lesser form of polymorphism."
6414,C# loop - break vs. continue,All have given a very good explanation. I am still posting my answer just to give an example if that can help. Here is the output: 0[Printed] 1[Printed] 2[Printed] So 3[Printed] &amp; 4[Printed] will not be displayed as there is break when i == 3 Here is the output: 0[Printed] 1[Printed] 2[Printed] 4[Printed] So 3[Printed]  will not be displayed as there is continue when i == 3,"In C#, the difference between `break` and `continue` in a loop is as follows:

- `break` stops the loop entirely when a certain condition is met, skipping all remaining iterations.
- `continue` skips the current iteration and moves on to the next one when a certain condition is met, without stopping the loop.

Example:
- Using `break` when `i == 3` results in the output: 0, 1, 2 (3 and 4 are not printed).
- Using `continue` when `i == 3` results in the output: 0, 1, 2",,I am still posting my answer just to give an example if that can help.

417142,What is the maximum length of a URL in different browsers?,"<h2>Short answer - de facto limit of 2000 characters</h2>
<p>If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software, and any search engine.</p>
<p>For specific use cases, longer URLs can be considered. Outside of search engines, 8000 characters offers wide compatibility as of 2023. Read on for all the details...</p>
<h2>Longer answer - first, the standards...</h2>
<p>The original HTTP/1.1 specification, published in 1999, <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 2616</a>, said in section 3.2.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP protocol does not place
any a priori limit on the length of
a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
the URI of any resource they    serve,
and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
unbounded length if they    provide
GET-based forms that could generate
such URIs. A server    SHOULD return
414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
URI is longer    than the server can
handle (see section 10.4.15).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, this was obsoleted by an updated specification largely to match actual usage, <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.1.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 7230</a>; it suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in
practice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients
support, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2022, a new update was published, defining HTTP semantics independently of HTTP version (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3). <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.1-5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 9110, section 4.1</a>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that all senders and recipients support, at a minimum, URIs with lengths of 8000 octets in protocol elements. Note that this implies some structures and on-wire representations (for example, the request line in HTTP/1.1) will necessarily be larger in some cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>...and the reality</h2>
<p>That's what the <em>standards</em> say. For the <em>reality</em>, there was an article on <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190902193246/https://boutell.com/newfaq/misc/urllength.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">boutell.com</a> (link goes to Internet Archive backup) that discussed what individual browser and server implementations will support. The executive summary is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: this is a quote from an article written in <em>2006</em>, but in 2015 IE's declining usage means that longer URLs <em>do</em> work for the majority. However, IE still has the limitation...)</p>
<h2>Internet Explorer's limitations...</h2>
<p><a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/208427"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IE8's maximum URL length is 2083 chars</a>, and it seems <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3721034/how-long-an-url-can-internet-explorer-9-take"">IE9 has a similar limit</a>.</p>
<p>I've tested IE10 and the address bar will only accept 2083 chars. You can <em>click</em> a URL which is longer than this, but the address bar will still only show 2083 characters of this link.</p>
<p>There's a <a href=""https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2014/08/13/url-length-limits/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nice writeup on the IE Internals blog</a> which goes into some of the background to this.</p>
<p>There are mixed reports IE11 supports longer URLs - see comments below. Given some people report issues, the general advice still stands.</p>
<h2>Search engines like URLs &lt; 2048 chars...</h2>
<p>Be aware that the <a href=""http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sitemaps protocol</a>, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL.

<h2>Is this information up to date?</h2>
<p>This is a popular question, and as the original research is ~14 years old I'll try to keep it up to date: As of <strong>Sep 2023</strong>, the advice still stands. While modern browsers will support longer URLs, search engines do not so the headline figure remains &quot;under 2000 chars&quot;</p>
","The maximum length of a URL varies depending on the browser and server. Here's a summary:

**General Guidelines:**

* To ensure compatibility with most browsers and servers, keep URLs under 2000 characters.
* For specific use cases, URLs up to 8000 characters may be supported, as recommended by the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 7230) and the latest HTTP semantics update (RFC 9110).

**Browser-Specific Limits:**

* Internet Explorer (IE):
	+ IE8: 2083 characters
	+ IE9: similar limit to IE8
	+ IE10: 208","Internet Explorer's limitations...
IE8's maximum URL length is 2083 chars, and it seems IE9 has a similar limit.","Short answer - de facto limit of 2000 characters
If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software, and any search engine. For specific use cases, longer URLs can be considered. Read on for all the details...
Longer answer - first, the standards... The executive summary is:

Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users. Search engines like URLs &lt; 2048 chars...
Be aware that the sitemaps protocol, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. While modern browsers will support longer URLs, search engines do not so the headline figure remains ""under 2000 chars"""

292357,What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?,"<p>It is important to contrast the design philosophy of git with the philosophy of a more traditional source control tool like SVN.</p>

<p>Subversion was designed and built with a client/server model. There is a single repository that is the server, and several clients can fetch code from the server, work on it, then commit it back to the server. The assumption is that the client can always contact the server when it needs to perform an operation.</p>

<p>Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the ""server"" don't need to be online at the same time. Git was designed so that people on an unreliable link could exchange code via email, even. It is possible to work completely disconnected and burn a CD to exchange code via git.</p>

<p>In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. By keeping a copy of the remote repository locally, git can figure out the changes needed even when the remote repository is not reachable.  Later when you need to send the changes to someone else, git can transfer them as a set of changes from a point in time known to the remote repository.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> is the command that says ""bring my local copy of the remote repository up to date."" </p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>git pull</code></strong> says ""bring the changes in the remote repository to where I keep my own code.""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Normally <strong><code>git pull</code></strong> does this by doing a <strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.</p>

<p>The take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least <strong>three copies</strong> of a project on your workstation. One copy is your own repository with your own commit history. The second copy is your working copy where you are editing and building. The third copy is your local ""cached"" copy of a remote repository.</p>
","The main difference between `git pull` and `git fetch` is that `git fetch` updates the local copy of the remote repository, while `git pull` updates the local repository with the changes from the remote repository and merges them into the working copy.

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Supporting Multiple Screens</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Screen size</strong><br/>
Actual physical size, measured as the screen's diagonal.
For simplicity, Android groups all actual screen sizes into four
generalized sizes: small, normal, large, and extra-large.</p>
<p><strong>Screen density</strong><br/>
The number of pixels within a physical area of the
screen; usually referred to as dpi (dots per inch). For example, a
&quot;low&quot; density screen has fewer pixels within a given physical area,
compared to a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;high&quot; density screen. For simplicity,
Android groups all actual screen densities into six generalized
densities: low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high, and
extra-extra-extra-high.</p>
<p><strong>Orientation</strong><br/>The orientation of the screen from the user's point of
view. This is either landscape or portrait, meaning that the screen's
aspect ratio is either wide or tall, respectively. Be aware that not
only do different devices operate in different orientations by
default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user
rotates the device.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong><br/> The total number of physical pixels on
a screen. When adding support for multiple screens, applications do
not work directly with resolution; applications should be concerned
only with screen size and density, as specified by the generalized
size and density groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Density-independent pixel (dp)</strong><br/> A virtual
pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express
layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way.
The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160
dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a
&quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles
any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density
of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:
<code>px = dp * (dpi / 160)</code>.
For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp
equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when
defining your application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on
screens with different densities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are at all serious about developing an Android app for more than one type of device, you should have read the screens support development document at least once. In addition to that, it is always a good thing to know the actual number of active devices that have a particular screen configuration.</p>

1335851,"What does ""use strict"" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?","<h1>Using <code>'use strict';</code> does not suddenly make your code better.</h1>
<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode"" rel=""noreferrer"">JavaScript strict mode</a> is a feature in <a href=""https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ECMAScript 5</a>. You can enable the strict mode by declaring this in the top of your script/function.</p>

<p>In their obsession to line up the numeric literals, the developer has inadvertently initialized variable <code>b</code> with an octal literal. Non-strict mode will interpret this as a numeric literal with value <code>24</code> (in base 10). However, strict mode will throw an error.</p>

<h2>Where should I use <code>'use strict';</code>?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In my <em>new</em> JavaScript application: <strong>Absolutely!</strong> Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In my <em>existing</em> JavaScript code: <strong>Probably not!</strong> If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break. If you want strict mode, you should be prepared to debug and correct your existing code. This is why <em>using <code>'use strict';</code> does not suddenly make your code better</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>How do I use strict mode?</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Insert a <code>'use strict';</code> statement on top of your script:</p>
<pre><code> // File: myscript.js

 'use strict';
 var a = 2;
 ....
</code></pre>
<p>Note that everything in the file <code>myscript.js</code> will be interpreted in strict mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Or, insert a <code>'use strict';</code> statement on top of your function body:</p>
<pre><code> function doSomething() {
     'use strict';
     ...
 }

<p>Everything in the <em>lexical scope</em> of function <code>doSomething</code> will be interpreted in strict mode. The word <em>lexical scope</em> is important here.

<h2>What things are prohibited in strict mode?</h2>
<p>I found a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20200704094929/http://yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/"" rel=""noreferrer"">nice article</a> describing several things that are prohibited in strict mode (note that this is not an exhaustive list):</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Historically, JavaScript has been confused about how functions
are scoped. Sometimes they seem to be statically scoped, but some
features make them behave like they are dynamically scoped. This is
confusing, making programs difficult to read and understand.
Misunderstanding causes bugs. It also is a problem for performance.
Static scoping would permit variable binding to happen at compile
time, but the requirement for dynamic scope means the binding must be
deferred to runtime, which comes with a significant performance
penalty.</p>
<p>Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically.
That means that the features that previously required dynamic binding
must be eliminated or modified. Specifically, the with statement is
eliminated, and the eval function’s ability to tamper with the
environment of its caller is severely restricted.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of strict code is that tools like <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/"" rel=""noreferrer"">YUI Compressor</a>
can do a better job when processing it.</p>
<h2>Implied Global Variables</h2>
<p>JavaScript has implied global variables. If
you do not explicitly declare a variable, a global variable is
implicitly declared for you. This makes programming easier for
beginners because they can neglect some of their basic housekeeping
chores. But it makes the management of larger programs much more
difficult and it significantly degrades reliability. So in strict
mode, implied global variables are no longer created. You should
explicitly declare all of your variables.</p>
<h2>Global Leakage</h2>
<p>There are a number of situations that could cause <code>this</code>
to be bound to the global object. For example, if you forget to
provide the <code>new</code> prefix when calling a constructor function, the
constructor's <code>this</code> will be bound unexpectedly to the global object, so
instead of initializing a new object, it will instead be silently
tampering with global variables. In these situations, strict mode will
instead bind <code>this</code> to <code>undefined</code>, which will cause the constructor to
throw an exception instead, allowing the error to be detected much
sooner.</p>
<h2>Noisy Failure</h2>
<p>JavaScript has always had read-only properties, but you
could not create them yourself until ES5’s <code>Object.createProperty</code>
function exposed that capability. If you attempted to assign a value
to a read-only property, it would fail silently. The assignment would
not change the property’s value, but your program would proceed as
though it had. This is an integrity hazard that can cause programs to
go into an inconsistent state. In strict mode, attempting to change a
read-only property will throw an exception.</p>
<h2>Octal</h2>
<p>The octal (or base 8) representation of numbers was extremely
useful when doing machine-level programming on machines whose word
sizes were a multiple of 3. You needed octal when working with the CDC
6600 mainframe, which had a word size of 60 bits. If you could read
octal, you could look at a word as 20 digits. Two digits represented
the op code, and one digit identified one of 8 registers. During the
slow transition from machine codes to high level languages, it was
thought to be useful to provide octal forms in programming languages.</p>
<p>In C, an extremely unfortunate representation of octalness was
selected: Leading zero. So in C, <code>0100</code> means 64, not 100, and <code>08</code> is an
error, not 8. Even more unfortunately, this anachronism has been
copied into nearly all modern languages, including JavaScript, where
it is only used to create errors. It has no other purpose. So in
strict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed.</p>
<h2>Et cetera</h2>
<p>The arguments pseudo array becomes a little bit more
array-like in ES5. In strict mode, it loses its <code>callee</code> and <code>caller</code>
properties. This makes it possible to pass your <code>arguments</code> to untrusted
code without giving up a lot of confidential context. Also, the
<code>arguments</code> property of functions is eliminated.</p>
<p>In strict mode, duplicate keys in a function literal will produce a
syntax error. A function can’t have two parameters with the same name.
A function can’t have a variable with the same name as one of its
parameters. A function can’t <code>delete</code> its own variables. An attempt to
<code>delete</code> a non-configurable property now throws an exception. Primitive
values are not implicitly wrapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Reserved words for future JavaScript versions</h2>
<p>ECMAScript 5 adds a list of reserved words. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error. The reserved words are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>implements</code>, <code>interface</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>package</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>yield</code></p>

baseline density assumed by the system for a &quot;medium&quot; density screen.
At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp
units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use.
The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi
/ 160). For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical
pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your
application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on screens with

","The main difference between px, dip, dp, and sp is their usage in Android development. 

- `dp` (or `dip`) is used for measurements such as margin and padding.
- `sp` is used for text size only.
- `px` is not recommended as it does not scale with screen density.

Android automatically translates these units into pixels at runtime, eliminating the need for complex calculations. This ensures consistent sizing across different screen densities.",,"<code>dp</code> is  <code>dip</code>. Use it for everything (margin, padding, etc.). Use <code>sp</code> for {text-size} only. To get the same size on different screen densities, Android translates these units into pixels at runtime, so there is no tricky math for you to do."

git-pull - Fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch
SYNOPSIS

git pull   …
DESCRIPTION

Runs git-fetch with the given parameters, and calls git-merge to merge the 
retrieved head(s) into the current branch. With --rebase, calls git-rebase 
instead of git-merge.

Note that you can use . (current directory) as the &lt;repository> to pull 
from the local repository — this is useful when merging local branches 
into the current branch.

Also note that options meant for git-pull itself and underlying git-merge 
must be given before the options meant for git-fetch.

<p>By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is
also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that
you are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using
the --tags or --no-tags options or by configuring
remote..tagOpt. By using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly,
you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested

<blockquote>
<p>These are dimension values defined in XML. A dimension is specified
with a number followed by a unit of measure. For example: 10px, 2in,
5sp. The following units of measure are supported by Android:</p>
<p><strong>dp</strong></p>
<p>Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the
physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a 160 dpi
(dots per inch) screen, on which 1dp is roughly equal to 1px. When
running on a higher density screen, the number of pixels used to draw
1dp is scaled up by a factor appropriate for the screen's dpi.
Likewise, when on a lower density screen, the number of pixels used
for 1dp is scaled down. The ratio of dp-to-pixel will change with the
screen density, but not necessarily in direct proportion. Using dp
units (instead of px units) is a simple solution to making the view
dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen
densities. In other words, it provides consistency for the real-world
sizes of your UI elements across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>sp</strong></p>
<p>Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended that you use
this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for
both the screen density and the user's preference.</p>
<p><strong>pt</strong></p>
<p>Points - 1/72 of an inch based on the physical size of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>px</strong></p>
<p>Pixels - Corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. This unit of
measure is not recommended because the actual representation can vary
across devices; each device may have a different number of pixels per
inch and may have more or fewer total pixels available on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>mm</strong></p>
<p>Millimeters - Based on the physical size of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>in</strong></p>
<p>Inches - Based on the physical size of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A dimension is a simple resource that is referenced using the value provided in the name attribute (not the name of the XML file). As such, you can combine dimension resources with other simple resources in one XML file, under one  element.</p>
","The main difference between px, dip (or dp), and sp is how they scale on different Android devices:

1. **px (Pixels)**: Actual pixels on the screen, not recommended due to varying screen densities and sizes.
2. **dp (Density-independent Pixels)**: Abstract units based on a 160 dpi screen, scaling up or down depending on screen density to maintain consistent real-world sizes.
3. **sp (Scale-independent Pixels)**: Similar to dp, but also scaled by the user's font size preference, recommended for font sizes.
4. **dip**: Same as dp, often used interchangeably.

","The main difference between `git pull` and `git fetch` is that `git fetch` updates the local cache of the remote repository, while `git pull` merges the changes directly into the local copy. `git fetch` allows for a ""fetched mirror"" of the remote, providing advantages such as improved performance and feedback about the state of the local repository.

<em>(Keeping in mind that pictures speak louder than words!, I have provided pictorial representation)</em></p>
<p>Let's take an example that you are working on a project with your team members. So there will be one main Branch of the project and all the contributors must fork it to their own local repository and then work on this local branch to modify/Add modules then push back to the main branch.</p>
<p>So,
<strong>Initial State</strong> of the two Branches when you forked the main project on your local repository will be like this- (<code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are Modules already completed of the project)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/SPky3.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SPky3.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you have started working on the new module (suppose <code>D</code>)  and when you have completed the <code>D</code> module you want to push it to the main branch, But meanwhile what happens is that one of your teammates has developed new Module <code>E</code>, <code>F</code> and modified <code>C</code>.<br>
So now what has happened is that your local repository is lacking behind the original progress of the project and thus pushing of your changes to the main branch can lead to conflict and may cause your Module <code>D</code> to malfunction.</p>

<p>To avoid such issues and to work parallel with the original progress of the project there are Two ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Git Fetch-</strong> This will Download all the changes that have been made to the origin/main branch project which are not present in your local branch. And will wait for the Git Merge command to apply the changes that have been fetched to your Repository or branch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <code>git fetch</code> command downloads commits, files, and refs from a
remote repository into your local repository.</p>
<p>Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody <em>else</em> has
been working on. It’s similar to SVN update in that it lets you see
how the central history has progressed, but it doesn’t force you to
actually merge the changes into your repository. Git <strong>isolates
fetched content as a from existing local content</strong>, it has absolutely
<strong>no effect on your local development work</strong>. Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the <code>git checkout</code> command. This makes
fetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with
your local repository.</p>
<p>When downloading content from a remote repository, <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code> commands are available to accomplish the task. You can consider
<code>git fetch</code> the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download
the remote content, but not update your local repository's working state,
leaving your current work intact. <code>git pull</code> is the more aggressive
alternative, it will download the remote content for the active local
branch and immediately execute <code>git merge</code> to create a merge commit
for the new remote content. If you have pending changes in progress
this will cause conflicts and kickoff the merge conflict resolution
flow.</p>

<p>With <code>git pull</code>:</p>
<ul>

<li>It doesn't need to be explicitly checked out. Because it implicitly does a <code>git merge</code>.</li>
<li>The merging step will affect your local development and <em>may</em> cause conflicts</li>
<li>It's basically NOT safe. It's aggressive.</li>
<li>Unlike <code>git fetch</code> where it only affects your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code>, git pull will affect both your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>.git/refs/heads/</code></li>

<h2>To see the actual difference</h2>
<p>Just do:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin master
git checkout master

<p>If the remote master was updated you'll get a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to update your local branch)
</code></pre>
<p>If you didn't <code>fetch</code> and just did <code>git checkout master</code> then your local git wouldn't know that there are 2 commits added. And it would just say:</p>
<pre><code>Already on 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
</code></pre>
<p>But that's outdated and incorrect. It's because git will give you feedback solely based on what it knows. It's oblivious to new commits that it hasn't pulled down yet...</p>
<hr />
<h2>Is there any way to see the new changes made in remote while working on the branch locally?</h2>
<p>Some IDEs (e.g. Xcode) are super smart and use the result of a <code>git fetch</code> and can annotate the lines of code that have been changed in remote branch of your current working branch. If that line has been changed by both local changes and remote branch, then that line gets annotated with red. This isn't a merge conflict. It's a <em>potential</em> merge conflict. It's a headsup that you can use to resolve the future merge conflict before doing <code>git pull</code> from the remote branch.</p>

I was hoping to edit the most popular answer, but failed. I tried to make it as comprehensive and complete as I could.</p>
<p>You can refer to the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p><code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code> a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5.</p>
<p>Directives are similar to statements, yet different.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>use strict</code> does not contain key words: The directive is a simple expression statement, which consists of a special string literal (in single or double quotes). JavaScript engines, that do not implement ECMAScript 5, merely see an expression statement without side effects. It is expected that future versions of ECMAScript standards introduce <code>use</code> as a real key word; the quotes would thereby become obsolete.</li>
<li><code>use strict</code> can be used only at the beginning of a script or of a function, i.e. it must precede every other (real) statement. It does not have to be the first instruction in a script of function: it can be preceded by other statement expressions that consist of string literals ( and JavaScript implementations can treat them as implementation specific directives). String literals statements, which follow a first real statement (in a script or function) are simple expression statements. Interpreters must not interpret them as directives and they have no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>use strict</code> directive indicates that the following code (in a script or a function) is strict code.
The code in the highest level of a script (code that is not in a function) is considered strict code when the script contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
The content of a function is considered strict code when the function itself is defined in a strict code or when the function contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
Code that is passed to an <code>eval()</code> method is considered strict code when <code>eval()</code> was called from a strict code or contains the <code>use strict</code> directive itself.</p>
<p>The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important):</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode.</li>
<li>In strict mode all variables have to be declared: if you assign a value to an identifier that has not been declared as variable, function, function parameter, catch-clause parameter or property of the global <code>Object</code>, then you will get a <code>ReferenceError</code>. In normal mode the identifier is implicitly declared as a global variable (as a property of the global <code>Object</code>)</li>
<li>In strict mode the keyword <code>this</code> has the value <code>undefined</code> in functions that were invoked as functions (not as methods). (In normal mode <code>this</code> always points to the global <code>Object</code>). This difference can be used to test if an implementation supports the strict mode:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>var hasStrictMode = (function() { &quot;use strict&quot;; return this===undefined }());
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Also when a function is invoked with <code>call()</code> or <code>apply</code> in strict mode, then <code>this</code> is exactly the value of the first argument of the <code>call()</code>or <code>apply()</code> invocation. (In normal mode <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are replaced by the global <code>Object</code> and values, which are not objects, are cast into objects.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>TypeError</code>, when you try to assign to readonly properties or to define new properties for a non extensible object. (In normal mode both simply fail without error message.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode, when passing code to <code>eval()</code>, you cannot declare or define variables or functions in the scope of the caller (as you can do it in normal mode). Instead, a new scope is created for <code>eval()</code> and the variables and functions are within that scope. That scope is destroyed after <code>eval()</code> finishes execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode the arguments-object of a function contains a static copy of the values, which are passed to that function. In normal mode the arguments-object has a somewhat &quot;magical&quot; behaviour: The elements of the array and the named function parameters reference both the same value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>SyntaxError</code> when the <code>delete</code> operator is followed by a non qualified identifier (a variable, function or function parameter). In normal mode the <code>delete</code> expression would do nothing and is evaluated to <code>false</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>TypeError</code> when you try to delete a non configurable property. (In normal mode the attempt simply fails and the <code>delete</code> expression is evaluated to <code>false</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when you try to define several properties with the same name for an object literal. (In normal mode there is no error.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when a function declaration has multiple parameters with the same name. (In normal mode there is no error.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode octal literals are not allowed (these are literals that start with <code>0</code>. (In normal mode some implementations do allow octal literals.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode the identifiers <code>eval</code> and <code>arguments</code> are treated like keywords. You cannot change their value, cannot assign a value to them, and you cannot use them as names for variables, functions, function parameters or identifiers of a catch block.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode are more restrictions on the possibilities to examine the call stack. <code>arguments.caller</code> and <code>arguments.callee</code> cause a <code>TypeError</code> in a function in strict mode. Furthermore, some caller- and arguments properties of functions in strict mode cause a <code>TypeError</code> when you try to read them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
","The `""use strict""` directive in JavaScript, introduced in ECMAScript 5, enables strict mode for the code that follows it. This mode is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language that eliminates certain deficits and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The main effects of strict mode include:

1. **Implicit global variables are not allowed**: Variables must be declared before use.
2. **`with` statement is not allowed**: This statement can lead to confusing and hard-to-debug code.
3. **`this` has a value of `undefined` in functions**: Unless explicitly set, `this` will be `undefined` in","<code>""use strict""</code> a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5.

<h3>Density-independent pixel (dp)</h3>
<p>A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. As described above, the density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a &quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:</p>
<p>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</p>
<p>For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure
proper display of your UI on screens with different densities.</p>
<p>Understanding pixel to dp and vice versa is very essential (especially for giving exact dp values to creative team)</p>
<pre><code>dp = px * 160 / dpi

MDPI = 160 dpi || Therefore, on MDPI 1 px = 1 dp
For example, if you want to convert 20 pixel to dp, use the above formula,
dp = 20 * 160 / 160 = 20.
So, 20 pixel = 20 dp.

HDPI = 240 dpi - So, on HDPI 1.5 px = 1 dp
XHDPI = 320 dpi - So, on XHDPI 2 px = 1 dp
XXHDPI = 480 dpi - So, on XXHDPI 3 px = 1 dp

For example, let us consider Nexus 4.
If 24 pixels to be converted to dp and if it is a Nexus 4 screen, developers can
convert it to dp easily by the following calculation :
dp = 24 * 160 / 320 = 12 dp
Screen dimension:
768 x 1280 pixel resolution (320 ppi or 320dpi)
Optional (screen size):
 4.7&quot; diagonal
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Try to get all pixel values in even numbers from the creative team. Otherwise precision lose will happen while multiplying with 0.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>px</h3>
<p>It is explained above. Try to avoid in layout files. But there are some cases, where px is required. for example, ListView divider line. px is better here for giving a one-pixel line as a divider for all across screen resolutions.</p>
<h3>sp</h3>
<p>Use sp for font sizes. Then only the font inside the application will change while device fonts size changes (that is, Display -&gt; Fonts on Device). If you want to keep a static sized font inside the app, you can give the font dimension in dp. In such a case, it will never change. Developers may get such a requirement for some specific screens, for that, developers can use dp instead of sp. In all other cases, sp is recommended.</p>
","The main difference between px, dip (dp), and sp is how they scale on different screen densities and sizes.

* **px (pixel)**: A physical pixel on the screen. It's not recommended to use px for layout dimensions, but it's suitable for cases like a one-pixel line divider.
* **dp (density-independent pixel)**: A virtual pixel unit that scales with screen density. 1 dp is equal to 1 physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen. Use dp for layout dimensions to ensure proper display on different screens.

<p>sp take the text size of the device, whereas dp take that of device density standard( never change in a device)

<p>You can use sp for layout bounds also, it will work :)
<strong>No standard app use sp for whole text</strong></p>
<p>Use sp and dp for text size considering UX.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use sp for text in the toolbar( can use android dimens available for different screen sizes with dp)</li>
<li>Don't use sp for text in small bounded buttons, very smaller text, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people use huge FONT size in their phone for more readability, giving them small hardcoded sized text will be a UX issue. Put sp for text where necessary, but make sure it won't break the layout when the user changes his settings.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have a single app supporting all dimensions, adding xxxhdpi assets increases the app size a lot. But now xxxhdpi phones are common so we have to include xxxhdpi assets at least for icons in the sidebar, toolbar, and bottom bar. It's better to move to vector images to have a uniform and better quality images for all screen sizes.</p>
<p>Also, note that people use custom fonts on their phones. So lack of a font can cause problems regarding spacing and all. Say text size 12sp for a custom font may take some pixels extra than the default font.</p>

226910,How to sanity check a date in Java,"<p>As shown by @Maglob, the basic approach is to test the conversion from string to date using <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">SimpleDateFormat.parse</a>. That will catch invalid day/month combinations like 2008-02-31.</p>

<p>However, in practice that is rarely enough since SimpleDateFormat.parse is exceedingly liberal. There are two behaviours you might be concerned with:</p>

<p><strong>Invalid characters in the date string</strong>
Surprisingly, 2008-02-2x will ""pass"" as a valid date with locale format = ""yyyy-MM-dd"" for example. Even when isLenient==false.</p>

<p><strong>Years: 2, 3 or 4 digits?</strong>
You may also want to enforce 4-digit years rather than allowing the default SimpleDateFormat behaviour (which will interpret ""12-02-31"" differently depending on whether your format was ""yyyy-MM-dd"" or ""yy-MM-dd"")</p>

<h2>A Strict Solution with the Standard Library</h2>

<p>So a complete string to date test could look like this: a combination of regex match, and then a forced date conversion. The trick with the regex is to make it locale-friendly.</p>

<pre><code>  Date parseDate(String maybeDate, String format, boolean lenient) {
    Date date = null;

    // test date string matches format structure using regex
    // - weed out illegal characters and enforce 4-digit year
    // - create the regex based on the local format string
    String reFormat = Pattern.compile(""d+|M+"").matcher(Matcher.quoteReplacement(format)).replaceAll(""\\\\d{1,2}"");
    reFormat = Pattern.compile(""y+"").matcher(reFormat).replaceAll(""\\\\d{4}"");
    if ( Pattern.compile(reFormat).matcher(maybeDate).matches() ) {

      // date string matches format structure, 
      // - now test it can be converted to a valid date
      SimpleDateFormat sdf = (SimpleDateFormat)DateFormat.getDateInstance();
      sdf.applyPattern(format);
      sdf.setLenient(lenient);
      try { date = sdf.parse(maybeDate); } catch (ParseException e) { }
    } 
    return date;
  } 

  // used like this:
  Date date = parseDate( ""21/5/2009"", ""d/M/yyyy"", false);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the regex assumes the format string contains only day, month, year, and separator characters. Aside from that, format can be in any locale format: ""d/MM/yy"", ""yyyy-MM-dd"", and so on. The format string for the current locale could be obtained like this:</p>

<pre><code>Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
SimpleDateFormat sdf = (SimpleDateFormat)DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.SHORT, locale );
String format = sdf.toPattern();
</code></pre>

<li>Seems better at being strict about invalid characters in the date string, unlike SimpleDateFormat</li>

</ol>

<p>It's quite simple to use:</p>

","To sanity check a date in Java, you can use the `SimpleDateFormat.parse` method, but it has limitations, such as being too liberal with invalid characters and year formats. A more robust approach is to combine a regex match with a forced date conversion. This involves:

2. Using `SimpleDateFormat` to parse the date string, with the `lenient` property set to `false` to ensure strict parsing.

It remained unclear to me how to design layouts capable to handle different screen sizes. I hate the DP concept and so on when I need to implement a &quot;flexible&quot; UI layout for different screens. (Hey iOS developers - yes, you're right it's a Storyboard concept).</p>
<p>Android has not bad UI concept, but lacks iOS Storyboard features, unfortunately. Designing flexible UI in Android is not an easy thing (at the best).</p>
<p>Here goes the article that helped me to understand what to do in Android to make layouts for different screen sizes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How to Design UI for Android Apps for Different Screen Size</strong></p>
<p>To design an app UI for different screen sizes, our initial design has to
meet a minimum required space for each screen size. Android defines a
minimum size (in dp) for each generalized screen type. Here is an
Android screen size guideline.
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/MPEMR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/MPEMR.jpg"" alt=""Minimum Screen Size for Android in dp"" /></a>
When we get the screen size in dp, it is not enough for us to design
the Android app UI. For each screen size, we need to prepare graphics
and bitmap images for each density. Here is an Android screen density
guideline.
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Px14F.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Px14F.jpg"" alt=""Android Density Guideline (dpi)"" /></a></p>
<p>For easy calculation, we can follow the 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between
the four generalized densities. If we create a 36×36 pixel picture for
ldpi device, the rest densities pictures size will be 48×48 for mdpi,
72×72 for hdpi, and 96×96 for xhdpi.</p>
<p><strong>How to Design Android Apps UI in Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Many designers have problems designing Android app UI in photoshop or another pixel
based graphic design tools because of the density-independent unit, dp.
Designers don’t know how to map dp to pixel. Google also doesn’t give
a clear Android UI design guide for them, though they give a basic
formula for dp and pixel translation.</p>
<p>As Android’s definition, 1pd equal to 1px under 160 dpi device (mdpi).
So we want to design an Android app for xlarge Android devices with
mdpi density, we can define our UI size in pixel as 960 pixels in width
and 720px in height; Follow the same mapping rule, we can get
following Android App screen size UI design guideline:</p>

","The article discusses the challenges of designing Android app UI for different screen sizes and resolutions. It highlights the differences between px (pixels), dip (density-independent pixels), dp (density-independent pixels), and sp (scale-independent pixels). 

- **px** (pixels) is a physical pixel on the screen.
- **dip** or **dp** (density-independent pixels) is a unit of measurement that represents a pixel on a 160 dpi screen, making it density-independent.
- **sp** (scale-independent pixels) is similar to dp, but it is also scaled according to the user's font size preference.

The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html#STRICT"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle.STRICT</code></a> mode throws an exception complaining that there is no such date.</p>

","The key difference between `git pull` and `git fetch` is how they handle updating your local repository with changes from a remote repository. 

- `git pull` automatically fetches changes from the remote repository and rebases (or merges) them with your local repository, which can create new commits.
- `git fetch`, on the other hand, only fetches the changes from the remote repository but does not automatically rebase or merge them with your local repository. You need to manually rebase (using `git rebase`) or merge (using `git merge`) the fetched changes into your local repository.

<p>compile the above with </p>

<pre><code>csc.exe /target:exe /out:Bob.exe Bob.cs
</code></pre>

<p>I use the slowAES.wsc from the other post you referenced, with 2 changes: I do not call getPaddedBlock() for the key in the EncryptString or DecryptString() methods. This really needs a PBKDF but let's not worry about that now. Here's what the modified EncryptString looks like: </p>

<pre><code>function EncryptString(plainText)
{
  // this is really wrong - need a PBBKDF to get the key, instead
  // of just using the passphrase
  var key = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(_passphrase);
  // var nkey = slowAES.getPaddedBlock(key, 0, _keysize, _mode);
  var bytesToEncrypt = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(plainText);

  var result = slowAES.encrypt(bytesToEncrypt, 
      _mode,
      key,
      _keysize,
      _iv);
  return result['cipher'];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This means you have to use a passPhrase that is <em>exactly</em> the length required by the keysize.  If you use AES256, then pass a 32-char string (32 * 8 = 256 bits).  Seems like you figured this out already. </p>

<p>The client of the WSC component is also Javascript (though it can be any COM language).  Here's what I used.</p>

<pre><code>function toHexString(a)
{
    var ret = '';
    for(var i = 0;i &lt; a.length;i++)
        ret += (a[i] &lt; 16 ? '0' : '') + a[i].toString(16) + ' ';
    return ret.toLowerCase();
}


//var plaintext = ""Hello. This is a test. of the emergency broadcasting system."";
var plaintext = ""watson?"";

try
{
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext: "" + plaintext);
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext.length: "" + plaintext.length);

    WScript.echo( ""instantiate "");
    var aes = new ActiveXObject(""Ionic.Com.SlowAES"");

    WScript.echo( ""keysize "");
    aes.KeySize = 256;

    WScript.echo( ""passphrase "");
    aes.PassPhrase= ""12345678901234567890123456789012"";  // 32 chars long

    WScript.echo( ""mode "");
    aes.Mode = ""CBC"";

    WScript.echo( ""encrypting... "");
    var result = aes.EncryptString(plaintext);

    WScript.echo( ""Cryptotext: "" + toHexString(result));

    WScript.echo( ""decrypting... "");
    var decrypted = aes.DecryptBytesToString(result);

    WScript.echo( ""decrypted: "" + decrypted);
}
catch(e)
{
    WScript.echo(""Exception: "" + e); 
    //     WScript.echo(e.Number + "": "" + e.Name);
    WScript.echo(e.Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I then run this code, the Javascript and C# produces the same cipher text for a plaintext of ""watson?"", using AES256, passphrase of 12345678901234567890123456789012, and an IV of 16 bytes of zero.  The ciphertext generated is: </p>

<pre><code>8B 68 A6 23 08 2A D8 A0 EB 99 17 8F 69 03 18 FF
</code></pre>

<p>It successfully decrypts in both cases. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Though I packaged the slowAES encryption in a WSC, it will be interoperable running outside the COM environment as well. The WSC part is unnecessary for this question, but was necessary to demonstrate the answer for a prior question, which  was, ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/270510/how-to-encrypt-in-vbscript-using-aes"">how can I get VBScript and .NET AES to interoperate?</a>""</p>

They each use a RFC2898-compliant key derivation function.  You can specify the password, salt, IV, and plaintext, as well as the number of RFC2898 iterations to use in the PBKDF2.  You can easily verify that the ciphertext is the same for each of these test programs. Maybe the example will be useful for someone. </p>

* `sp` (Scale independent pixels): scaled based on user's font size preference, recommended for font sizes to make them dynamic based on screen sizes.

2025282,"What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?","<p>The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as <strong>pixels (px)</strong>. A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable.</p>

<p>Screen resolution is measured in terms of number of pixels on the screen. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important.</p>

<p><strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device.</p>

<p>A density independent pixel (dp or dip) is equal to one pixel at the baseline density or 160 dpi (dots per inch).</p>

<p>1 px/1dp = 160 dpi/160 dpi</p>

<p>2 px/1dp = 320 dpi(2x)/160 dpi</p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>dpi is dots per inch</p>

<p>So, at 320 dpi, 1 dp is equal to 2 px.</p>

<p>Formula</p>

<p>px/dp = dpi/160dpi</p>

<p>Dots per inch (dpi) is a measure of the sharpness (that is, the density of illuminated points) on a display screen. The dots per inch for a given picture resolution will differ based on the overall screen size since the same number of pixels are being spread out over a different space.</p>

<p>Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. Suppose in a case, a tablet and phone has the same pixel resolution 1280 by 800 pixels (160 dpi) and 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi) respectively.</p>

<p>Now because a tablet is at baseline density (160 dpi) its physical and density independent pixels sizes are the same, 1280 by 800. The phone on the other hand has a higher pixel density, so it has half as many density independent pixels as physical pixels. So a phone has 400 by 640 density independent pixels. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you have two devices with similar screen size, but different pixel density, say one is 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi), and the other is 400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi), we don't need to define totally different layouts for these two devices as we can measure assets in terms of density independent pixel which is same for both devices.</p>

<p>800 by 1280 pixels (320dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p>400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p><strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size.
For accessibility purposes, Android allows users to customize their device's font size. Users that have trouble reading text can increase their device's font size. You can normally find this option in the display setting on your phone or tablet under font size. It's often also available through the accessibility settings.</p>

<p>With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. But when device's font size is large, for example 125%, 16 sp will translate to 20 dp or 1.25 times 16.</p>

<p>If you use dp as the unit for font size, then that piece of text has a specific physical size no matter if the user has customize device's font size. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.</p>

","The main difference between px, dip, dp, and sp is:

* **px (pixels)**: the smallest unit of a screen, used to measure screen resolution.
* **dp (density-independent pixels) or dip**: a unit that allows designers to create assets that appear the same way on different devices, regardless of resolution or density. 1 dp is equal to 1 pixel at 160 dpi.
* **sp (scale-independent pixels)**: a unit used for font size, which allows users to customize font size for accessibility purposes. sp is similar to dp, but scales with the device's font size settings.

In summary,","Screen resolution is measured in terms of number of pixels on the screen. <strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device. A density independent pixel (dp or dip) is equal to one pixel at the baseline density or 160 dpi (dots per inch).","The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as <strong>pixels (px)</strong>. A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important. <strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device. Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone. <strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size. With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight."

226953,WCF and confirmations - do I need to send back a 'OK got it' to client?,"<p>There are three messaging patterns mentioned here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Synchronous request-response    </li>
<li>Asynchronous send (fire and forget with one-way service)</li>
<li>Asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service)</li>
</ol>

<p>All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. </p>

<p>For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate.</p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default configuration.</p>

<p>This returns a 200 response on the same http connection once the service has completed all its tasks. This means that calls to the service will block while waiting for the response - your client will hang until the service has written to the database and done anything else it needs.</p>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 returned indicates that the message has been accepted. From the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http rfc</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. (...) The 202 response is intentionally non-committal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. </p>

<hr>

<p>Below is some more info about implementing these patterns in WCF. After writing it, it is pretty long but there are a couple of useful comments as well as the code.</p>

<p>As Whisk mentioned, Juval Lowy has an article covering a lot this detail (and more!) <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163537.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default behaviour in WCF so you should not need to do anything - it works with lots of different bindings including wsHttpBinding and basicHttpBinding.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that the behaviour described with your client hanging waiting for the 200 response occurrs even if you have a void Operation like so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>To set an operation as one-way you simply decorate it as so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Methods decorated in this way must only have a return type of void. One gotcha is that the service will happily build and you won't get an exception saying the service config is invalid until you connect to it.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>The interface code for creating a duplex callback service is:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract(CallbackContract = typeof(IMyContractCallback))]
interface IMyContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay=true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}

public interface IMyContractCallback
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void ServiceResponse(string result);      
}
</code></pre>

<p>And on the client side you need something like so to set up the callback:</p>

<pre><code>public class CallbackHandler : IMyContractCallback        
{
    #region IEchoContractCallback Members

    public void ServiceResponse(string result)
    {
        //Do something with the response
    }

    #endregion
}

// And in the client when you set up the service call:

InstanceContext instanceContext = new InstanceContext(new CallbackHandler());
MyContractClient client = new MyContractClient(instanceContext);

InputMessage msg = new InputMessage();

client.DoSomething(msg);           
</code></pre>

<p>In the service you would perhaps have some code like:</p>

<pre><code>class MyContractImplementation : IMyContract
{
    public void DoSomeThing(MyMessage Message)
    {

        string responseMessage;

        try
        {
           //Write to the database
           responseMessage = ""The database call was good!"";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            responseMessage = ex.Message;
        }

        Callback.ServiceResponse(responseMessage);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. If you: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Consume an exception, you will get no warning of the error (but the callback will happen)</p></li>
<li><p>Throw an unhandled exception, the service will terminate and the client will not even get the callback.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown.</p>
","The question of whether to send back an ""OK, got it"" response to a client in WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) depends on the chosen messaging pattern. There are three main patterns:

1. **Synchronous Request-Response**: This is the default configuration where the client waits for a response (200 OK) after sending a request. The service completes all tasks before returning a response.
2. **Asynchronous Send (Fire and Forget)**: The client receives a 202 Accepted response as soon as the service infrastructure accepts the request. The client continues execution without waiting for the service to complete its tasks.
3. **Asynchronous",There are three messaging patterns mentioned here:,"There are three messaging patterns mentioned here: All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs.

The main <strong>valid</strong> time it might be useful is when dealing with an external library (from another language) that has a class / etc that happens to be a C# keyword, but I'll admit I've <strong>never</strong> had this problem in reality. It helps that C# allows you to rename method argument names when overriding / implementing interfaces, so that avoids one common set of cases.</p>

<p>Another (arguably lazy) use is in code generation; if you always prefix fields / variables / etc with @theName, then you don't have to worry about special cases. Personally, I simply cross-check against a list of C# keywords / contextual keywords, and add something like underscore.</p>

<p>Loading is 2.3x faster than your PIL-based code.</p>

<p>Your PIL code also has an unneeded copy: <code>array(img)</code> should be <code>asarray(img)</code>. It only costs 5% of the slow loading time. But after optimization this will be significant and you have to keep in mind which numpy operators create a copy.</p>

<h3>Fast decompression</h3>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/zstd/"" rel=""noreferrer"">zstd benchmarks</a>, when optimizing for decompression <a href=""https://python-lz4.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">lz4</a> is a good choice.

<p>The load time was measured inside Python (3.7.3), using the minimum wall-clock time over 20 runs on my desktop. According to occasional glances at <code>top</code> it always seemed to be running on a single core.</p>

<h3>For the curious: profiling</h3>

<p>I'm not sure if the Python version matters, most work is supposed to happen inside of C libraries. To validate this I've profiled the <code>pickle + lz4</code> variant:</p>

<pre><code>perf record ./test.py &amp;&amp; perf report -s dso

<p>Most time is spent inside of the Linux kernel, doing <code>page_fault</code> and stuff associated with (re-)allocating memory, probably including disk I/O.

This must be set, not to the root of your OpenCV installation, but to the <em>build</em> folder beneath it.  I used an entry in <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> to set this variable, e.g.:</p>

<pre>set(OpenCV_DIR C:/Users/myacct/AppData/Local/opencv-3.0.0/build)</pre></li>
<li><p>To link with OpenCV, CMake uses either <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> or <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> (see previous point above) to locate a file named <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em>.

<li><p><strong><em>Problems may occur when variable names used by OpenCVConfig.cmake conflict with those CLion has stored in its environment</em></strong>. In particular, if your OpenCV was built by Microsoft Visual C (<em>MSVC</em>), as is <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Windows distribution from opencv.org</a>, it won't work with CLion.    </p>

<p>Because CLion's build toolchain (<kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>S</kbd>-toolchain) uses either MinGW or Cygwin, <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> will search for OpenCV binaries under a subdirectory named <em>mingw</em> or <em>cygwin</em> <strong><em>and will find none</em></strong> because the binaries were built with MSVC (it will look in a directory like <em>vc11</em> or <em>vc12</em> instead).  This probably means <strong><em>you will need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</em></strong>.</p>

<p><em>Would reconfiguring OpenCVConfig.cmake to point to the MSVC binaries make this work?</em> you may ask.  Unfortunately the answer is still no, because <a href=""http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Interoperability_of_Libraries_Created_by_Different_Compiler_Brands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libraries built with one compiler typically cannot be linked with another one</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> or <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> likely contain diagnostic messages, but when CLion executes CMake for you, <code>message(STATUS)</code> calls are not displayed.

","To link a project with OpenCV in CLion on Windows, you will likely need to build OpenCV from source.

Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:

1. **Build OpenCV from source**: Compile OpenCV using MinGW or Cygwin to ensure compatibility with CLion.

<p><strong>Calculations on intervals</strong> are executed on date part and time part separately, so they may lead to strange formats. Examples:</p>

In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38082414/1995738"">this answer</a> I proposed a function to convert a date part of an interval to hours.

<p>Per <a href=""https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype-datetime.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the SQL standard all fields of an interval value must
  have the same sign, so a leading negative sign applies to all fields;
  for example the negative sign in the interval literal '-1 2:03:04'
  applies to both the days and hour/minute/second parts. PostgreSQL
  allows the fields to have different signs, and traditionally treats
  each field in the textual representation as independently signed, so
  that the hour/minute/second part is considered positive in this
  example. If IntervalStyle is set to sql_standard then a leading sign
  is considered to apply to all fields (but only if no additional signs
  appear). Otherwise the traditional PostgreSQL interpretation is used.
  To avoid ambiguity, it's recommended to attach an explicit sign to
  each field if any field is negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internally interval values are stored as months, days, and seconds.
  This is done because the number of days in a month varies, and a day
  can have 23 or 25 hours if a daylight savings time adjustment is
  involved. The months and days fields are integers while the seconds
  field can store fractions. Because intervals are usually created from
  constant strings or timestamp subtraction, this storage method works
  well in most cases. Functions justify_days and justify_hours are
  available for adjusting days and hours that overflow their normal
  ranges.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Indicating that code should be interpreted in strict mode specifies to user agents like browsers that they should treat code literally as written, and throw an error if the code doesn't make sense.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> Consider in your <code>.js</code> file you have the following code:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: [NO STRICT MODE]</strong></p>

<p>So why does the variable name is being printed in both cases?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without strict mode turned on, user agents often go through a series of modifications to problematic code in an attempt to get it to make sense. On the surface, this can seem like a fine thing, and indeed, working outside of strict mode makes it possible for people to get their feet wet with JavaScript code without having all the details quite nailed down. However, as a developer, I don't want to leave a bug in my code, because I know it could come back and bite me later on, and I also just want to write good code. And that's where strict mode helps out.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: [STRICT MODE]</strong></p>

city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Reference Error: asignment is undeclared variable city.

<p>In this function, we are using a variable called <code>name</code> inside the function. Internally, the compiler will first check if there is any variable declared with that particular name in that particular function scope. Since the compiler understood that there is no such variable, it will check in the outer scope. In our case, it is the global scope. Again, the compiler understood that there is also no variable declared in the global space with that name, so it creates such a variable for us in the global space. Conceptually, this variable will be created in the global scope and will be available in the entire application.</p>

<p>Another scenario is that, say, the variable is declared in a child function. In that case, the compiler checks the validity of that variable in the outer scope, i.e., the parent function. Only then it will check in the global space and create a variable for us there.

2058021,SQL Server 2005 Full Text Search over multiple tables and columns,"<p>This is more of a syntax problem.  How do you divine the user's intent with just one input box?</p>

<ul>
<li>Are they looking for ""John Hamburg"" the person? </li>
<li>Are they looking for ""John Hamburg Street""?</li>
<li>Are they looking for ""John"" who lives on ""Hamburg Street"" in Springfield? </li>
<li>Are they looking for ""John"" who lives in the city of ""Hamburg""?</li>
</ul>

<p>Without knowing the user's intent, the best you can hope for is to OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you need to program in a ton of logic, depending on the number of words passed in:</p>

<p>2 words:</p>

<p>Search Employee data for term 1, Search Employee data for term 2, Search Address data for term 1, Search address data for term 2.  Merge results by term, order by most hits.</p>

<p>3 words:</p>

<p>Search Employee data for term 1, Search Employee data for term 2, Search employee data for term 3, Search Address data for term 1, Search address data for term 2, Search address data for term 3.  Merge results by term, order by most hits.</p>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>I guess I would redesign the GUI to separate the input into Name and Address, at a minimum.  If that is not possible, enforce a syntax rule to the effect ""First words will be considered a name until a comma appears, any words after that will be considered addresses""</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Your best bet is still OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits.  Here's an example of that, and an example why this is not ideal without some pre-processing of the input to divine the user's intent:</p>

<pre><code>insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (1, 'John Hamburg')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (2, 'John Smith')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (3, 'Bob Hamburg')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (4, 'Bob Smith')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (5, 'John Doe')

insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (1, 'Main St.', 'Springville', 1)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (2, 'Hamburg St.', 'Springville', 2)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (3, 'St. John Ave.', 'Springville', 3)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (4, '5th Ave.', 'Hamburg', 4)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (5, 'Oak Lane', 'Hamburg', 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Now since we don't know what keywords will apply to what table, we have to assume they could apply to either table, so we have to OR the terms against each table, UNION the results, Aggregate them, and compute the highest rank.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, [Name], Street, City, SUM([Rank])
FROM
(
    SELECT emp.Id, [Name], Street, City, [Rank]
    FROM Employee emp 
    JOIN [Address] addr ON emp.Id = addr.EmployeeId
    JOIN CONTAINSTABLE(Employee, *, 'JOHN OR Hamburg') AS keyTblEmp ON emp.Id = keyTblEmp.[KEY]

    UNION ALL

    SELECT emp.Id, [Name], Street, City, [Rank]
    FROM Employee emp 
    JOIN [Address] addr ON emp.Id = addr.EmployeeId
    JOIN CONTAINSTABLE([Address], *, 'JOHN OR Hamburg') AS keyTblAdd ON addr.Id = keyTblAdd.[KEY]   
) as tmp

GROUP BY Id, [Name], Street, City
ORDER BY SUM([Rank]) DESC
</code></pre>

<p>This is less than ideal, here's what you get for the example (in your case, you would have wanted John Doe from Hamburg to show up first):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Id       Name              Street            City           Rank

3        Bob Hamburg       St. John Ave.     Springville    112
5        John Doe          Oak Lane          Hamburg        96

","The question is about implementing a full-text search in SQL Server 2005 across multiple tables and columns.

38315538,JavaScript | Angular | Controller As Syntax: Cannot Use `this`,"<p>The problem is certainly <strong>not</strong> that <code>this</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript.
There is no rule in the <em>controller as</em> syntax that says you would need to assign the value of <code>this</code> to a variable with the same name as the controller and I'm pertty sure angular won't do such thing either. Why would it? That would be incredibly stupid use of <code>Function</code> constructor and just a needless bug.</p>

<p>There's a simple way to test that JavaScript reserved words are not the issue here. Name your controller ""throw"". <code>""Parent as throw""</code>. <code>throw</code> is a reserved word, but does that <em>throw</em> errors? No. Does that work? Yes.</p>

<p><code>this</code> is, however, reserved in the context of angular's own template expressions. It's used to refer to the current <code>scope</code> of the expression.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=""Parent as this""&gt;
    {{log(this)}}
&lt;/div&gt;


angular.module('testApp', []).controller('Parent', function($scope){
    this.test = 'foo';
    $scope.log = function(arg){
        console.log(arg);
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>The above won't throw errors, but it won't log the controller either. Instead, it will log a <em>scope</em> object containing the <code>log</code> function and <code>$parent</code> and what not. </p>

<p>In fact, it will also contain something intresting to us: property <code>this: Object</code>, our controller. </p>

<p>And sure enough, change the template expression to <code>{{log(this.this)}}</code> and it will log the controller instance just fine. Still wouldn't use <code>'this'</code> as the name though, it would probably just cause more bugs by mistake than undefined functions ever have.</p>
","The issue with using `this` in the ""controller as"" syntax in Angular is not because `this` is a reserved word in JavaScript, but because `this` is reserved in the context of Angular's template expressions to refer to the current scope.

","The issue with PHP's DateTime returning 0 for microseconds is due to the `date()` function only accepting integers and not handling milliseconds or microseconds as expected. To display the date and time with milliseconds or microseconds in PHP, you can use the following approaches:

* For milliseconds: `list($sec, $usec) = explode('.', microtime(true)); echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s.', $sec). $usec;`
* For microseconds: `list($usec, $sec) = explode(' ', microtime()); echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $sec). substr($usec, 1);",,"An explanation of how to display the ISO 8601 format date &amp; time in PHP with <strong>milli</strong>seconds and <strong>micro</strong>seconds...

1816723,Best practice for structuring a 'large' Rails app,"<p>I believe the benefits of isolating your concerns into separate apps outweigh the costs. I would probably start off with just 2 apps (one for the main site and superadmin, one for the client sites and admins), accessing the same database, but you could do 4.</p>

<p>The downside is you don't really have isolation since all your apps are tied to one database. You will eventually run into scaling problems with your database, but starting off simple with one database will get you launched. One strategy for scaling later would be to add a slave db that the client site and main site apps use, while the admin apps use the master db. This along with a TON of caching will get you pretty far.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with having multiple rails apps access one db, however you will need a way to share common code across your apps. Your models for the most part. I've done this before by tossing all my models in a plugin that I share as a sub-module in git or as an external in svn. Having separate apps will make each app smaller and easier to maintain.</p>

<p>However, where do you keep your migrations? Where do you test your models? I would opt for the superadmin app. Also, you make a change to a model or the schema, and now you have to check 2-4 apps and make sure they still work!</p>

<p>Better isolation, separate db's and inter-app communication through web APIs (SOA) and you don't have to worry about that. SOA I think is the way to go after a certain point, but SOA might be premature when you first start out.</p>

<p>At any rate, having separate apps sets you up for SOA but you don't have to jump beyond a single db to start.</p>
","For structuring a large Rails app, consider isolating concerns into separate apps, starting with 2-4 apps accessing the same database. This approach allows for easier maintenance and scalability, but may lead to issues with database scaling and shared code management. To address these concerns, use a shared plugin or module for common code, and designate a primary app for migrations and model testing. As the app grows, consider transitioning to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with separate databases and inter-app communication through web APIs for better isolation and scalability.",,"I believe the benefits of isolating your concerns into separate apps outweigh the costs.

<p>to be a list of something, but the signature you supplied declares that <code>a</code> is a <code>List</code> of something. Similarly <code>filter</code> returns a Prelude list of something, but the signature requires that it return a <code>List</code> of something. </p>

<p>The natural implementation of <code>map</code> for <code>List</code> would distinguish the cases of <code>List</code> that you gave in the type declaration, that is, it would ""pattern match"":</p>

ghci&gt; :t mapX
mapX :: Eq a =&gt; t -&gt; [List a] -&gt; [List a]

<p>The <code>Eq</code> constraint is required because you presuppose that <code>List</code>s be tested for equality and thus that their elements can be.  <code>f</code> is not used, so it just ends up as a 'could be anything' parameter, here <code>t</code>. </p>

<p>Of course, if you have your own <code>filterList</code> for <code>List</code>s it will also typecheck</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let filterList pred Nil = Nil; filterList pred (a :. as) = if pred a then a :. filterList pred as else filterList pred as

<p>With <strong>Text File Input</strong> there are a lot more options available to you for reading the file. You can set the <em>Filetype</em> as CSV and select your separator in the <em>Content</em> tab, and list out the fields you want to grab in the <em>Fields</em> tab.

<p>The advantages you gain when using the <strong>CSV Input</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>NIO: Native system calls for reading the file means faster performance, but it is limited to only local files currently. No VFS support.</li>
<li>Parallel running: If you configure this step to run in multiple copies or in clustered mode, and you enable parallel running, each copy will read a separate block of a single file allowing you to distribute the file reading to several threads or even several slave nodes in a clustered transformation.</li>
<li>Lazy conversion: If you will be reading many fields from the file and many of those fields will not be manipulate, but merely passed through the transformation to land in some other text file or a database, lazy conversion can prevent Kettle from performing unnecessary work on those fields such as converting them into objects such as strings, dates, or numbers.</li>

Also, <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs#example-code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the ConvNetJS example code with comments (<a href=""https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/docs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the full documentation). You can take a look at the code at the top of the demo page for the code itself.</p>

<p>An <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">activation function</a> is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some ""threshold"" (this is specific for each different activation function). This comes from how neurons work, where they take some electrical input and will only activate if they reach some threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 1:</strong> The first set of images show the raw input image (the left colored image) and the right of the two images is the output after going through the activation functions. You shouldn't really be able to interpret the second image because it is going through non-linear and perceived random non-linear transformations through the network.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 2:</strong> Similar to the previous point, the ""activations"" are the functions the image pixel information is passed into. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gradient</a> is essentially the slope of the activation function. It appears more sparse (i.e., colors show up in only certain places) because it shows possible areas in the image that each node is focusing on. For example, the 6th image on the first row has some color in the bottom left corner; this may indicate a large change in the activation function to indicate something interesting in this area. This <a href=""https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> may clear up some confusion on weights and activation functions. And <a href=""https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> has some really great visuals on what each step is doing.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 3:</strong> This confused me at first, because if you think about a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ReLu function</a>, you will see that it has a slope of one for positive <code>x</code> and 0 everywhere else. So to take the gradient (or slope) of the activation function (ReLu in this case) doesn't make sense. The ""max activation"" and ""min activation"" values make sense for a ReLu: the minimum value will be zero and the max is whatever the maximum value is. This is straight from the definition of a ReLu. <s>To explain the gradient values, I suspect that some Gaussian noise and a <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs/blob/4c3358a315b4d71f31a0d532eb5d1700e9e592ee/src/convnet_net.js#L43"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bias term of 0.1</a> has been added to those values.</s> <strong>Edit:</strong> the gradient refers to the slope of the cost-weight curve shown below.

Migrating from Firebird 1.0 to Firebird 1.5 should be relatively easy (migrating to more recent versions like Firebird 2.5 might be more work).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The client has a regular connection to Firebird server at its port (3050 by default, but can be changed). When it is registering for events, it sends the request over that connection. The server opens another connection at some random port (4012 for example) and sends that port number to the client. The client then connects to that port.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>When client registers for events, the server opens a random port (ex. 6023) and sends that info to the client. This is where the problem becomes evident: the client tries to connect to that port (6023) on the firewall (as it “sees” the firewall as a server). Since the port is completely random, there are certainly no forwarding rules for that port on the firewall, so connection is denied. Using this setup, there is no way to make it work, short of forwarding all the traffic (all ports) to Firebird server, which is the exact thing we wish to avoid by placing the firewall in front.</p>

<p>Create two different Statement instances for your two insert operations.</p>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>

<p>If you want to reuse one single Statement instance, close the resources in a <strong>Finally</strong> block. Actually it is always a good idea to put the close statement in <strong>finally</strong> block or simply use <strong>try-catch-resource</strong> that jdk7+ has to offer.  </p>

<h2>Unrelated to your concrete questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>It is highly recommended that you avoid using java code in jsp file. Search the terms ""jsp servlet mvc"".  </li>
<li>Use PreparedStatement instead of Statement to avoid sql injection attack.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>EDIT for solution 1:</h3>

<p>In your first try block:<br>
Under  <code>Statement myStatement = myConnection.createStatement();</code><br>
add  <code>Statement myStatementTwo = myConnection.createStatement();</code>  </p>

<p>In your second try block:<br>
change <code>myStatement.executeUpdate(sqlString);</code><br>
to <code>myStatementTwo.executeUpdate(sqlString);</code>  </p>

<p>Add a final block for your first try block and close all your resource there. Editing your code is pretty much the same as rewriting everything from scratch, it is going to benefit you most if you can do that yourself.</p>

<h3>EDIT after OP provided HTML code and database</h3>

<p>Your <strong>Dest_has_Categories</strong> table's <strong>Dest_idDest</strong> is an <strong>auto_increment</strong> column but it is also a foreign key referencing <strong>Dest</strong>'s primary key <strong>idDest</strong>.

There will be problems if the auto incremented value generated by DBMS does not exist in the referencing table.  </p>

<p>Please make the foreign keys not auto_increment and when you insert to the reference table <strong>Dest_has_Categories</strong>, please insert existing <strong>Categories</strong>'s id and <strong>Dest</strong>'s id.  </p>

","To insert form data into two different tables on a database through a JSP page, you can use one of two solutions:

  <p>Unhiding rows with the method -unhideRowsAtIndexes:withAnimation: did not work correctly prior to macOS 10.13 when using non-contiguous sets of rows. This has been fixed for all applications on macOS 10.13.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll notice in the second paragraph that your issue is mentioned.</p>

<p>If you’re developing for an earlier version of macOS, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>func unhideRows(at indexes: IndexSet, animation: NSTableView.AnimationOptions = []) {
    if #available(macOS 10.13, *) {
        outlineView.unhideRows(
            at: indexes,
            withAnimation: animation
        )
    } else {
        for range in indexes.rangeView {
            outlineView.unhideRows(
                at: IndexSet(integersIn: range),
                withAnimation: animation
            )
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I wish I could say that this fixes the problem 100% of the time, however, that doesn't seem to be the case. Every once in awhile, I still seem to run into bounds exceptions like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>-[__NSArrayM objectAtIndex:]: index 11 beyond bounds [0 .. 10]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be due to other factors, such as my semi-complex filtering code, but as I can’t actually see what Apple’s doing in its <code>NSTableView</code> methods like <code>_updateVisibleViewsBasedOnUpdateItems</code>, I’m just not sure.</p>

<p>Oh, well. I thought I should post an answer so other folks struggling with this issue are aware of the bug. Good luck and safe travels, my fellow earthling.</p>
","The issue of `NSTableView` crashing when calling `unhideRowsAtIndexes` is due to an AppKit bug that was fixed in macOS 10.13. For earlier versions, a workaround is to use variable row heights or implement a custom `unhideRows` function that unhides rows in contiguous ranges. However, even with this workaround, occasional bounds exceptions may still occur due to other factors.","It's an AppKit bug.

226931,How to map classes in NHibernate using Roles or Composition,"<p>It seems to me that this is more a question around how to model a domain well, rather than an NHibernate mapping issue.</p>

<p>Once you've sorted out your domain modelling, I think you'll find the NHibernate mapping falls out relatively easily.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to separate the identity of a participant from the role they play in an activity.</p>

<p>For example, you might have a Person object that captures the identify of a particular person.</p>

<p>Then, a completely separate object ""Student"" that captures the additional information to record the enrolment of a person as a student. Each instance of Student would have a reference to the person enrolled. A single person may be related to many ""Student"" records, one for each distinct enrolment.</p>

<p>In parallel, you could have a distinct ""Tutor"" object that records employment details when someone is hired to teach students in one-on-one situations. The Tutor object captures the additional details around how someone is employed as a tutor.</p>

<p>This structure gives you great flexibility - one person (Joe Bloggs) may just be a student, another person (Jane Doe) may just be a tutor, and a third (Chuck Norris) may be both.</p>

<p>Also, introducing another role (Lecturer, Marker, Administrator) becomes easier because the additions don't require changes to existing objects.</p>

<p>you're using Derived1 in two different ways according to the base class.  </p>

<p>You're effectively telling the C# compiler that Derived1 both: </p>

<ol>
<li>inherits Base </li>
<li>and Base uses instances of Derived1 through non-inheritance means.  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is not wrong (if that's what you really want), but it's unusual for most programming scenarios; you normally choose one or the other. However the benefit of your logic is: not only do you have an implicit instance of Derived1 through inheritance (same for any other derived class), but the base class can <em>also</em> handle other external instances of that same derived type through the type parameter <code>&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<p>One problem I see in the Base class is it turns into a kind of circular scenario when using the factory method as intended, because, to support all derived classes it would need to support something like <code>class Base&lt;T&gt; where T:Base&lt;T&gt;</code>. That's next to impossible to declare because you would have to say in a circular fashion: <code>Base&lt;Base&lt;Base&lt;!!!&gt;&gt;&gt; baseref = null;</code> where !!! represents an infinite number of the same. </p>

<hr>

<h2>One Solution...</h2>

<p>One possible (and strong solution) is to move the Type parameter from the class to the factory Create method and restrict its usage to the Base class type like so:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

public abstract class Base

    public static T Create&lt;T&gt;() where T : Base
    {
        return Activator.CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;();
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I have made the base class abstract which restricts instantiation to the derived types; however <strong>you can still use base class references</strong> (see <code>switch</code> statement usage below).    </p>

<p>These derived classes still inherit from base. </p>

<pre><code>public class Derived1 : Base
{
}

public class Derived2 : Base
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your factory method is restricted to create only instances of derived types.  The logic has been swapped around so the derived type is given to the factory method instead of the factory method being called on it.</p>

<pre><code>public class Program
{
    bool SomeFunction()
    {

    Base baseref = null;

     switch(DateTime.Now.Second)
     {
       case 1:
        baseref = Base.Create&lt;Derived1&gt;();  // OK
       break;

       case 2:
        baseref = Base.Create&lt;Derived2&gt;();  //OK
        break;

       case 60:
        baseref = Base.Create&lt;string&gt;(); //COMPILE ERR - good because string is not a derived class
        break;
     }

     // pass baseref somewhere

","The problem arises from using a generic base class with a derived class that inherits from it, causing a circular scenario. To solve this, the type parameter can be moved from the class to the factory method, restricting its usage to the base class type. This approach allows the factory method to create instances of derived types while preventing instantiation of the base class directly. The derived classes still inherit from the base class, and the factory method is restricted to create only instances of derived types.

One possible (and strong solution) is to move the Type parameter from the class to the factory Create method and restrict its usage to the Base class type like so: Your factory method is restricted to create only instances of derived types."

","To schedule actions at various timings from a list in Python, you can use the `viztask.waitTime()` function in conjunction with a `for` loop and the `yield` keyword. This allows you to pause the execution of a function for a specified amount of time. The example code demonstrates how to use this approach to wait for 2, 3, and 4 seconds, respectively, and print the wait time and elapsed time.

<p>If you have two components on the first row then you have two cells. Each cell is sized by the component in the cell. </p>

<p>For a simple printing of the array, I'm not sure how this code helps you. Without the context of the surrounding code, it's difficult for me to speculate as to what the code is doing.</p>

<p>It looks like you're trying to do your own equivalent of <code>printf(""%d"",num)</code>, but there is already a syscall to output an integer to the screen. I'd use that. But ... If you truly need to ""roll your own"", I've included code to do that.</p>

<p>Printing the array is similar to the input of the array.</p>

<p>I've reworked the previous example code. The input of the array is now a function. I removed the hardwired limit value of 250 in favor of using a new label: <code>arrend</code> [so, have a look]</p>

<p>Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array.</p>

<p>To manually do what syscall 1 does, I've added the <code>prtint</code> function. <code>arrprt</code> will use the syscall, but if you want it to use <code>prtint</code>, comment out the syscall and uncomment the block that calls <code>prtint</code></p>

","The provided code is written in MIPS assembly language and is used to create an array, sort it in ascending and descending order, and print the array. 

Here's a step-by-step summary:

1. **Initialization**: The code starts by initializing the array size and allocating space for it. The maximum size of the array is set to 250.

2. **User Input**: The code then prompts the user to input the size of the array and checks if the input size is within the allowed limit. If not, it asks for the size again.

3. **Array Input**: The code then prompts the user to input numbers to fill",,"This will allow <code>1000 / 4</code> numbers or <code>250</code>. Another bug: You were never filling the first element of <code>array</code>. Another [minor] bug is that you're relying on <code>$t2</code> to have a zero value without explicitly setting it. Here's the cleaned up code. I added a limit check on the user's count Printing the array is similar to the input of the array. I've reworked the previous example code. I removed the hardwired limit value of 250 in favor of using a new label: <code>arrend</code> [so, have a look]
Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array."

<p>For a left outer join, for the same condition, there is a big difference depending on where it is placed - the join clause or the where clause.</p>

<p>Using MS SQL-Server:</p>

DECLARE @t2 TABLE ( id INT )
INSERT INTO @t2 VALUES ( 2 ),( 3 ),( 10 ),( 11 ),( 12 );

4   NULL
5   NULL
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, all rows from driving table with NULLs for no match from slave table.</p>

<p><strong>Condition in ON clause</strong></p>

<p>For the condition in the ON clause:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM @t1 t1
LEFT OUTER JOIN @t2 t2 ON t2.id = t1.id AND t1.id = 2
</code></pre>

<p>This gives:</p>

<pre><code>1   NULL
2   2

</code></pre>

<p>This gives only the matched row(s) because the where clause filters out all rows that do not match the conditions which are applied after the join clause on a row by row basis.</p>
","**Summary:**

When using a LEFT OUTER JOIN in SQL Server with multiple conditions, the placement of the conditions in the ON clause versus the WHERE clause significantly affects the results. 

- **ON clause**: Conditions in the ON clause filter the join operation itself, preserving all rows from the driving table and NULLing non-matched rows in the slave table.
- **WHERE clause**: Conditions in the WHERE clause filter the results after the join operation, potentially excluding rows from the driving table that do not match the conditions, thus behaving more like an INNER JOIN for those conditions.

This distinction is crucial for achieving the desired outcome in queries involving LEFT OUTER","<strong>Left Outer Join - ON clause vs WHERE clause</strong>

","To retrieve the first data from multiple almost the same or correct data in a table, you can use two approaches:

1. **Using ROW_NUMBER()**: This method involves using the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to assign a unique number to each row within a partition of a result set. You can then select the rows with `rn = 1` to get the first occurrence of each group.
2. **Using MIN() and JOIN**: This method involves using a subquery to find the minimum time for each status, and then joining this result with the original table to get the corresponding rows.

end
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT (brief-ish explanation):</p>

<p>What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids]. It looked like:</p>

<pre><code>""name_ids""=&gt;{""7""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Партия"", ""which""=&gt;""Крутая""}, ""1""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""1"", ""what""=&gt;""Россия"", ""which""=&gt;""Единая""}, ""4""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Организация"", ""which""=&gt;""Молдавская""}}

<p>An ActiveRecord 'find' method can take an array of ids, but not a hash of values. What you were originally submitting to 'find' in this line:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(params[:name_ids])
</code></pre>

<p>...was the value for params[:name_ids]: </p>

<pre><code>{""7""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Партия"", ""which""=&gt;""Крутая""}, ""1""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""1"", 
""what""=&gt;""Россия"", ""which""=&gt;""Единая""}, ""4""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Организация"", 
""which""=&gt;""Молдавская""}
</code></pre>

<p>When what you wanted was:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(['7','1','4'])
</code></pre>

<p>which is what calling params[:name_ids].keys gives you. </p>

<p>The second problem was this line:</p>

<pre><code>name.update_attributes!(params[:name].reject { |k,v| v.blank? })
</code></pre>

<p>There was no value ':name' in params, so calling 'reject' on it cause the 'no method' error -- there is no 'reject' method on the nil object. What you wanted was to update the attributes for the 'name' that corresponded to the particular name in the loop. This meant you wanted to get the values out of params[:name_ids][:id] where :id was the id of 'name'. </p>

<p>It all goes back to the way fields_for created the params to begin with. This line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% fields_for ""name_ids[#{name.id}]"", name do |name_fields| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>meant that params would contain a hash called 'name_ids', with keys corresponding to name.id, that themselves would contain hashes of attributes that ActiveRecord could use in the update_attributes method. </p>

<p>There's a good bit of the famous Rails magic to keep track of in there -- does that help?</p>
","The solution to the ""Unknown key(s)"" ArgumentError is to extract the keys from the `params[:name_ids]` hash using `params[:name_ids].keys` when calling `Name.find`. Additionally, when updating attributes, use `params[:name_ids][name.id.to_s]` instead of `params[:name]` to access the correct hash of attributes for each name. This is because `fields_for` creates a nested hash in the params, where `name_ids` is a hash with keys corresponding to `name.id` and values containing hashes of attributes. 

Here is the corrected code:

<p>Q3 - don't worry about joining the tags tables with the others.  To paraphrase Knuth, build it first, then find the bottlenecks.  MySQL is very good at what it does.  Joining those tables together over and over and over again won't hurt.  </p>

<p>Q4 - It depends what you want to get out of the results.  usually you want the actual data and then you can just test for the number of rows returned to tell you whether it's true or false.</p>

   - **Tag Search**: Easily facilitated by the proposed database structure.
   - **Title and Description Searches**: Can be achieved using ""like"" with wildcards, regex, or full-text search.
3. **Performance Concerns**: It's advised not to prematurely optimize. MySQL is capable of handling joins efficiently, so focus on building","Q2 - title and description searches could be done using ""like"" with percents or with regex or full text search.","Q1 - you're better off with three separate tables for articles, tags, and a link table relating articles and tags. You could also do it with two tables for articles and an articles_tags table. Either two or three tables makes it easy to find which articles have a given tag and which tags are assigned to a given article. Q2 - title and description searches could be done using ""like"" with percents or with regex or full text search. Q3 - don't worry about joining the tags tables with the others. Q4 - It depends what you want to get out of the results. Q5 - again, you'd have to use ""like"" syntax and maybe some creative regex on the PHP side before the query is handed off to the database."

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that while some implementations of InputStream will return the total number of bytes in the stream, many will not. It is never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your code basically rely on / assume that all data sent, will be available immediately and reported accordingly by <code>in.available()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>dataOut.writeInt(theBytes.length);

<p>and then on the receiver side use that integer when creating the array:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] data = new byte[dis.readInt()];

<p>Does the bytes you send come from a <code>String</code>? In that case, you should be careful with the charset. The sender and receiver might have different default charsets.</p>

","The issue is not that `DataOutputStream` loses bits, but rather that the `available()` method of `InputStream` does not guarantee to return the total number of bytes in the stream. To ensure all data is received, send the length of the data as an integer before sending the data, and use this length to create a buffer on the receiving end. Additionally, be mindful of character encoding when sending strings as bytes, using a consistent charset like ""UTF-8"" to avoid interpretation issues.","The contract of <code>in.available()</code> does not guarantee anything.

For a given customer version, your build system then automatically gathers the application and the customer's repository, and builds the custom version. It makes things a little bit more complex on the application side at first, because you need to add parsing functionality, but it makes management of various customer versions a lot simpler, and somewhat less error prone."

This would be a alternative to a replicated cache.</p>

<p>The problem with replicated caches, is they scale inversely proportional to the number of nodes participating in the cache. i.e. their performance degrades as you add additional nodes. They work fine when there is a small number of nodes. If data is to be replicated between N nodes (or you need to send eviction messages to N nodes), then every write requires 1 write to the cache on the originating node, and N-1 writes to the other nodes.</p>

<p>In consistent hashing, you instead define a hashing function, which takes the key of the data you want to store or retrieve as input, and it returns the id of the server in the cluster which is responsible for caching the data for that key. So each caching server is responsible for a fraction of the overall keys, the client can determine which server will contain the sought data without any lookup, and data and eviction messages do not need to be replicated between caching servers.</p>

<p>The ""consistent"" part of consistent hashing, refers to how your hashing function handles new servers being added to or removed from the cluster: some re-distribution of keys between servers is required, but the function is designed to minimize the amount of such disruption.</p>

<p>In practice, you do not actually need a dedicated caching cluster, as your caches could run in-process in your web servers; each web server being able to determine the other webserver which should store cache data for a key.</p>

<p>Consistent hashing is used at large scale. It might be overkill for you at this stage. But just be aware of the scalability bottleneck inherent in O(N) messaging architectures. A replicated cache is possibly a good idea to <em>start with</em>.</p>

<p>EDIT: Take a look at <a href=""http://infinispan.org/docs/5.3.x/faqs/faqs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Infinispan</a>, a distributed cache which indeed uses consistent hashing out of box.</p>

19389238,Why do the following program leaks memory?,"<p>You're not doing anything wrong. GTK widgets use reference counting, but in your programme all the references are taken care of, so you're not (manually) leaking anything.</p>

<p>So why does Valgrind claim you are?</p>

<p>Firstly, GLib has its own ""slab"" memory allocator, called <code>GSlice</code>, which is generally faster than system <code>malloc</code> for small allocations. Unfortunately, it confuses Valgrind, but if you set the environment variable <code>G_SLICE=always-malloc</code>, <code>GSlice</code> is effectively turned off.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can set the <code>G_DEBUG=gc-friendly</code>, which is supposed to help Valgrind produce more accurate results (although it my experience it generally doesn't make any difference).</p>

<p>Both of these environment variables are listed in the <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.38/glib-running.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GLib documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, Valgrind will still report that your app leaks memory. The reason for this is that GTK (and its underlying libraries) allocate some ""static"" memory at start-up that doesn't get freed until the programme quits. This isn't really a problem, because typically the programme ends as soon as <code>gtk_main()</code> returns, and then the OS frees any remaining resources, so you're not <em>really</em> leaking anything. Valgrind thinks you are though, and for this reason it would be nice to have a <code>gtk_deinit()</code> function, but sadly there isn't one.</p>

<p>The best you can do instead is to teach Valgrind to ignore these things, via a suppressions file. The <a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/Valgrind"" rel=""nofollow"">Valgrind page on the Gnome Wiki</a> has details on all this and more.</p>

","Postgres shows two different formats for the same interval value because `to_char(interval)` formats hours differently based on the format specifier used (`HH`, `HH12`, or `HH24`).

I did <em>not</em> install the GAPPs zip. It's not needed and causes a lot of crash notifications.</li>
<li>Extract up-to-date Chrome APK from my actual android device. APK's for installed apps can be found in /data/app (but this my require root) or you could use a back-up solution to extract it.</li>
<li>Install the obtained APK by also DnD'ing it into the home screen, it will automatically install.
... And it worked.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the DnD issue, in my case the cause appeared to be that I was running Genymotion 'as administrator' (Why? Complicated: Because I have an unrelated virtualBox machine using a native disk image, which requires me to start virtualbox in privileged mode, which will crash Genymotion if it's not also running in privileged mode). However when I started GenyMotion not 'as admin' the dnd issue did not appear.
If this is not the issue in your case I think you can still get the stuff installed without DnD support:</p>

<ul>
<li>First get the files on your image in some way, use your imagination (or any file sharing web service)</li>
<li>Also get an APK for a decent file explorer with ZIP and root support. I use ES file explorer and my instructions will be based in it. I suggest, as for Chrome itself, to install it on your actual phone first and then grab the APK.</li>
<li>Install the file explorer, start it and become root (ES crashed the first couple of times in my case, but after some tries it worked)</li>
<li>make sure /system is mounted as r/w. in ES, use menu->root explorer->mount R/W, put /system on RW</li>
<li>Locate the Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1.zip, browse into it, select (long press) 'system' folder, extract to, 'choose path', point to /. The Zip will now be 'installed'</li>
<li>Go back to root explorer options, put /system back to RO</li>
<li>Reboot the emulator (in my case it crashed both on shutdown and first boot; I just closed the emulator after a few minutes and tried again. Then it worked)</li>

","When saving a large number of files from ZipArchives to SQL Server using ASP.NET MVC4 and ADO.NET, the process may appear to hang or the control may disappear due to the large amount of data being sent to the server.

3949121,Logic for 9 key keyboard to print qwerty keys,"<p>To do a really good design, you'll need a keyboard input routine which can tell when keys have been held for awhile, and when they have been released for awhile.  For a short time after a digit is pressed, you should keep the cursor on the newly-typed character; if the same digit is pushed again, you should change the newly-typed character.  If another digit is typed, make the selected digit 'permanent' and show the cursor on the character for the new key.  If no key is pushed for a second or so, advance the cursor to the next position.  If enter is pushed when the cursor is on a newly-typed digit, just advance the cursor.  If it's pushed within about 1/4 second of the cursor auto-advancing, do nothing.  If it's pushed when the cursor isn't on a character and hasn't just auto-advanced, confirm entry.</p>
","To design a 9-key keyboard to print QWERTY keys, the logic involves:

1. Tracking key press and release times.
2. Allowing character changes if the same key is pressed again shortly after.
3. Making the selected digit ""permanent"" when a different key is pressed.

","To resolve the issue of PHP's DateTime always returning 0 for microseconds, you can create an `ExtendedDateTime` class that extends the `DateTime` class. This custom class checks if the input time is the current time, and if so, it uses the `microtime` function to add microseconds to the time. The class then constructs a new `DateTime` object with the updated time, including microseconds, and returns it. This allows for more precise time representation, including microseconds, when formatting the date and time.",,"Working from Lucky's comment and this feature request in the PHP bug database, I use something like this:"

18633795,iOS7 compatibility with App on iPad,"<p>Just updating my answer based on what we've found last week and implemented for our app as a solution. </p>

","To create an array and sort it in ascending and descending order in MIPS, follow these steps:

1. **Store numbers in the array**: When storing numbers, increment the index by 4 for each subsequent number to avoid overwriting previous values.
2. **Access array elements**: Use the syntax `array($t7)` to access elements, similar to C or C++ style, where `$t7` is the index.
3. **Sorting**: Implement a sorting algorithm, such as bubble sort, to arrange the array in ascending or descending order.

","The code compares three ways to check if all values in a dictionary (`kwargs`) are the string ""false"". The methods are:

1. `v1`: Using a set comparison (`set(kwargs.values()) == {'false'}`)
2. `v2`: Using a list comprehension with a conditional (`not [x for x in kwargs.values() if x!='false']`)
3. `v3`: Using the `all()` function with a generator expression (`all(v == 'false' for v in kwargs.values())`)

The results show that `v2` is the fastest, followed by `v1`, and `v3",,Interestingly using all() seems about 10x slower.

The provided C code searches for today's date in a `.txt` file named ""tasks.txt"" and prints the lines containing the date. 

**Key Points:**

* The code uses the `__DATE__` macro, which returns the date of compilation.
* It reads the ""tasks.txt"" file line by line and checks if the line contains the current date using the `strstr` function.
* If a match is found, the line is written to a new file named ""fp1"".

","The provided code is not in Java, but rather in JavaScript, and it's used to sanity check a date in the format ""yyyy-mm-dd"". It uses a combination of string manipulation and the Date object to verify if the input date is valid. The `isDateCorrect` function checks if the input string matches the date pattern, attempts to create a Date object from it, and then checks if the reformatted date string matches the original input. If all checks pass, it returns true, indicating the date is valid.

<p>It isn't Service Locator either, because it is not locating services - now this requires a few words of explanation.</p>

<p>Service locator should return distinct interfaces. Your method is returning objects implementing a single common interface. Here is the signature of a Service Locator:</p>

<pre><code>T LocateService&lt;T&gt;() { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the dreaded signature which has caused so much troubles to developers worldwide. The problem is that signature of this method doesn't tell what is the kind of objects the consumer may depend on. Let me show it with a longer example:</p>

<pre><code>class ServiceLocator {
    T Locate&lt;T&gt;();
}

class Golum {

    ServiceLocator locator;

    Consumer(ServiceLocator depedency) { ... }

    void beNice() {
        Preciousss myPrecious = this.locator.Locate&lt;Previousss&gt;();
        myPrecious.DoMagic();
    }
}

void main() {
    new Golum(new ServiceLocator()).beNice(); // Fails!
}
</code></pre>

<p>This piece of code is the sublimation of all evil that comes with misuse of service locators. Main function is initializing the Golum class, but it has no clue what Golum requires. Golum just asks for a service locator, any service locator, and then gets going. When beNice method is invoked, it turns that particular service locator object that was passed has no knowledge of the Preciousss class at all, and then call to Locate fails.</p>

<p>Bottom line, negative consequences appear when a class doesn't declare its dependencies explicitly. And if you take a look at your case, this is not what happens there. Your class depends on SomeInterface and then asks for the resolver object which also knows of SomeInterface. I don't see negative consequences there.</p>

<p>When talking about naming, I might choose to call that ""locator"" object something like SomeInterfaceLookup, although SomeInterfaceLocator wouldn't be any worse than that.</p>
","The given implementation is neither a Factory nor a Service Locator. It doesn't create new instances like a Factory, and it doesn't locate distinct interfaces like a Service Locator. Instead, it returns objects implementing a single common interface.

","Yes, it is possible to export a DataGrid into a PDF in WPF. You can use the iTextSharp NuGet package to achieve this. The provided code example demonstrates how to export a DataTable to a PDF file using iTextSharp, which can be adapted for use with a DataGrid. The code creates a PDF document, adds a table with the DataTable's columns and rows, and saves the document to a file.",,I have modified this example to cater dynamic columns count in the datagrid which suggest iTextSharp nuget package to install.

","To check if an element at a specific position exists in a list, a custom method `TryElementAtOrDefault` can be used. This method iterates through the list, stopping when it reaches the desired index or determines that the index is out of range. It handles cases where the list is null, empty, or the index is negative, and it also accounts for the possibility that null is a valid value in the collection. The method returns a boolean indicating whether the element exists and outputs the element's value if it does.",,The issue the OP is trying to get at is that <code>Count()</code> will have to use the enumerator to <code>MoveNext()</code> through the whole <code>IEnumerator</code> collection.

","To give some margin between buttons, you can add a CSS style to the buttons, such as `margin: 10px 5px;`, as shown in the example code. This will add a margin of 10 pixels to the top and bottom of each button, and 5 pixels to the left and right. You can adjust these values as needed to achieve the desired spacing. Additionally, make sure to check if any other CSS styles are overriding the default behaviors of the buttons.",,"You are apparently using Bootstrap so after removing all your CSS and just using basic bootstrap markup, buttons are evenly spaced. But Buttons are inline elements, if they are not being laid out correctly it's due to your combination of html/css overriding default behaviors. Also, keep in mind that the bootstrap <code>xs</code> grid classes (  <code>col-xs-*</code> ) keeps things horizontal at all times regardless of media size."

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> use of <code>indexOf</code> in <strong>filterGender</strong> function</p>

<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong> directly compare the gender instead of <code>indexOf</code></p>

<pre><code>const filteredGender = this.list.filter(
    user =&gt; user.gender.toLowerCase() === lowerCaseGender

<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> You are filtering records from the <code>this.state.list</code> variable and then update it in same <code>state</code> variable.</p>

<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Use another variable <code>this.list</code> in <code>constructor</code> and use it to filter the records.</p>

<p>Define variable in <code>constructor</code></p>

<pre><code>constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      list: [],
      search: """"
    };
    this.list = []; // define new list here...

<p>You have to assign upcoming list to <code>this.list</code> variable in <strong>getList</strong> function</p>

","The provided Java code demonstrates a generic framework for managing bidirectional associations between two classes, `A` and `B`.

169420,Generic Java Framework to Manage Bidirectional Associations and Inverse Updates,"<p>Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism.  If your objects are JavaBeans, then you are looking at using PropertyChangeSupport and firing property change events.</p>

<p>If you do that (or have some other mechanism for detecting changes), then Glazed Lists provides an <a href=""http://publicobject.com/glazedlists/glazedlists-1.5.0/api/ca/odell/glazedlists/ObservableElementList.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ObservableElementList</a> that could easily be used to handle the association synchronization from the list end (i.e. adding A to List&lt; A> automatically calls a.setB(b)).  The other direction is easily handled using property change monitoring (or equivalent).</p>

<p>I realize that this isn't a generic solution, but it seems like it would be an easy foundation for one.</p>

<p>Note that something like this would <em>require</em> a special list implementation in the B class - no way short of AOP type solutions that you could handle it in the general case (i.e. using ArrayList or something like that).</p>

<p>I should also point out that what you are trying to achieve is something of the holy grail of data binding.  There are some decent implementations for binding at the field level (stuff like getters and setters) (see JGoodies binding and JSR 295 for examples).  There is also one really good implementation for list type binding (Glazed Lists, referred to above).  We use both techniques in concert with each other in almost all of our applications, but have never tried to go quite as abstract as what you are asking about.</p>

<p>If I were designing this, I would look at something like this:</p>

<pre><code>AssociationBuilder.createAssociation(A a, Connector&lt; A&gt; ca, B b,  Connector&lt; B&gt; cb, Synchronizer&lt; A,B&gt; sync)
</code></pre>

<p>Connector is an interface that allows for a single interface for various change notification types.  Synchronizer is an interface that is called to make sure both objects are in sync whenever one of them is changed.</p>

<pre><code>sync(ChangeInfo info, A a, B b) // make sure that b reflects current state of a and vice-versa.  
</code></pre>

<p>ChangeInfo provides data on which member changed, and what the changes actually were.  We are.  If you are trying to really keep this generic, then you pretty much have to punt the implementation of this up to the framework user.</p>

<p>With the above in place, it would be possible to have a number of pre-defined Connectors and Synchronizers that meet different binding criteria.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the above method signature is pretty similar to the JSR 295 createAutoBinding() method call.  Property objects are the equivalent of Connector.  JSR 295 doesn't have the Synchronizer (instead, they have a binding strategy specified as an ENUM - plus JSR 295 works only with property->property binding, trying to bind a field value of one object to that object's list membership in another object is not even on the table for them).</p>
","To manage bidirectional associations and inverse updates in Java, you can use a combination of event notification mechanisms, such as PropertyChangeSupport, and specialized list implementations like ObservableElementList from Glazed Lists. A generic solution would require a custom list implementation and could be achieved through an AssociationBuilder that takes in connectors and synchronizers to handle change notifications and updates. This approach is similar to JSR 295's createAutoBinding method, but with additional flexibility to handle more complex binding scenarios. Key components include:

* Connectors: interfaces for change notification types
* Synchronizers: interfaces to ensure objects are in sync when changes occur
*",Connector is an interface that allows for a single interface for various change notification types. Synchronizer is an interface that is called to make sure both objects are in sync whenever one of them is changed.,"Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism.

","To query the `wp_usermeta` table and look up an email in the `wp_users` table, use the following steps:

1. Use the correct table name `wp_usermeta`.
2. Specify a meta key in the WHERE clause to map the value (e.g., `meta_key = 'nickname'`).
3. Replace `'your_meta_key_name'` with the actual meta key.
4. Check the `wp_usermeta` table in phpmyadmin if unsure about fields.

Example code:
```php
global $wpdb;
$query1 = ""SELECT user_id FROM wp_usermeta WHERE meta_key = 'your","In WHERE Clause, you need to give a meta key with which the value has to be mapped.

","The provided Java code snippets demonstrate two approaches to sorting a string alphabetically and getting the position number. 

**Approach 1: Using ASCII values**
This method sorts the input string by comparing ASCII values of characters. It uses a simple sorting algorithm, where each character is compared with the rest of the characters in the string, and if a smaller character is found, they are swapped. The sorted string is then printed.

**Approach 2: Using alphabet to sort**

","To sanity check a date in Java, you can use the provided `validateDateFormat` function. This function attempts to parse a given date string using a predefined format (""MM/dd/yyyy"") and checks if the parsed date matches the original string when formatted back. If the date is invalid (e.g., ""02/29/2013""), the function will return `true`, indicating that the date is not parsed successfully. The function uses a `SimpleDateFormat` with `setLenient(false)` to strictly enforce the date format and catches `ParseException` to handle invalid dates.",e.g. 02/29/2013 is invalid date.
