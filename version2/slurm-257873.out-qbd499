Generated abstractive summary:
Both MVP and MVC frameworks separate concerns into three main parts: model (data source), controller/application logic (Presenter), and display code (View). The main difference is that MVC typically has the View and Controller interact directly with the Model, whereas MVP has the Presenter interact with both the Model and View.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View). The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view.

Inversion of Control is a programming technique that turns sequential code into a delegation structure, reducing code duplication by allowing the program to set up functions to be called when certain events occur, rather than manually controlling everything.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. It solves code duplication. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control.

MVP and MVC are software design patterns. MVP has two sub-patterns: Passive View and Supervising Controller. Passive View has a fine-grained interface, making views easy to test but limiting databinding. Supervising Controller uses databinding and leverages interaction logic. The Presentation Model (Model-View-ViewModel) combines the model and presenter into one class, adding UI-specific fields.

To understand break and continue in a C# loop, think of "break loop" (looping is broken and stops) and "continue loop" (loop continues to execute with the next iteration).

Extractive summary:

The author prefers using `break` to quit a loop when a condition is met, and `continue` to skip over certain elements in a list. They also suggest using a `do-until` loop as a more elegant alternative to `break` in some cases.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I tend to use <code>break</code> in loops that are searching a list for something. Once found, there's no point in continuing, so you might as well quit. I use <code>continue</code> when doing something with most elements of a list, but still want to skip over a few. The <code>break</code> statement also comes in handy when polling for a valid response from somebody or something.

In C/C++, #include <filename> searches standard libraries, while #include "filename" searches the current directory and then standard libraries.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In practice, the difference is in the location where the preprocessor searches for the included file. For <code>#include &lt;filename&gt;</code> the preprocessor searches in an implementation dependent manner, normally in search directories pre-designated by the compiler/IDE. For <code>#include "filename"</code> the preprocessor searches first in the same directory as the file containing the directive, and then follows the search path used for the <code>#include &lt;filename&gt;</code> form.

When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the following: 

- equals() must define an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and consistent).
- hashCode() must be consistent and equal for objects that are equal.
- If overriding one, override the other.
- Use the same fields to compute equals() and hashCode().
- Use EqualsBuilder and HashCodeBuilder from Apache Commons Lang library.
- Make keys immutable for hash-based collections.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The theory (for the language lawyers and the mathematically inclined): <code>equals()</code> (javadoc) must define an equivalence relation (it must be <em>reflexive</em>, <em>symmetric</em>, and <em>transitive</em>). In addition, it must be <em>consistent</em> (if the objects are not modified, then it must keep returning the same value). Furthermore, <code>o.equals(null)</code> must always return false.

C++ casts are preferred over C-style casts due to their clarity and ability to distinguish between different types of conversions.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
C-style casts conflate const_cast, static_cast, and reinterpret_cast. C++ casts stand out properly (as they should; casts are normally indicative of doing something bad) and properly distinguish between the different kinds of conversion that casts perform.

When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the symmetry requirement: if A.equals(B) returns true, then B.equals(A) must also return true. Omitting a getClass() check can lead to unexpected behavior with subclass instances. Always call super.equals(other) from the subclass's equals method, and check the subclass's instance type to handle subclass instances correctly.

Extractive summary:
The JLS (Java language specification) specifies that if <code>A.equals(B) == true</code> then <code>B.equals(A)</code> must also return <code>true</code>.

A race condition occurs in multi-threaded applications, where an assumption about the order of events between threads or processes leads to unexpected behavior. This often happens when multiple threads access shared resources or rely on each other's actions.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems. A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do. This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access. Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals. Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs.

Generated abstractive summary:
A NoSuchMethodError is likely due to a version mismatch between the compiled class and the one being used at runtime, possibly caused by different library versions or outdated class files.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Without any more information it is difficult to pinpoint the problem, but the root cause is that you most likely have compiled a class against a different version of the class that is missing a method, than the one you are using when running it. If the exception appears when calling a method on an object in a library, you are most likely using separate versions of the library when compiling and running. Make sure you have the right version both places. If the exception appears when calling a method on objects instantiated by classes <em>you</em> made, then your build process seems to be faulty. Make sure the class files that you are actually running are updated when you compile.

A NoSuchMethodError can be caused by using reflection and a method name or signature change, requiring parameter updates in the reflection code.

Extractive summary:
If you have code that reflects on a class and extracts a method by name (eg: with <code>Class.getDeclaredMethod("someMethodName", .....)</code>) then any time that method name changes, such as during a refactor, you will need to remember to update the parameters to the reflection method to match the new method signature, or the <code>getDeclaredMethod</code> call will throw a <code>NoSuchMethodException</code>.

If this is the reason, then the stack trace should show the point that the reflection method is invoked, and you'll just need to update the parameters to match the actual method signature.

Ground truth:
If a calling function starts foreach-ing over this object the function is called again until it "yields". The easiest way understand code like this is to type in an example, set some breakpoints and see what happens. Try stepping through this for example: BIGBLOCK Here is a real-life example BIGBLOCK

Generated abstractive summary:
The yield keyword in C# is used to implement IEnumerable, allowing a method to produce a sequence of results instead of computing them all at once, and to pass control back to the caller with each result.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The Array's each method implementation <strong>yields</strong> control over to the caller (the 'puts x') with <strong>each</strong> element of the array neatly presented as x. However <strong>.Net</strong> doesn't go all the way here.. C# seems to have coupled yield with IEnumerable, in a way forcing you to write a foreach loop in the caller as seen in Mendelt's response.

The foreach loop in C# does not support getting the index of the current iteration, as it's designed for enumeration, not indexed access.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The <code>foreach</code> is for iterating over collections that implement <code>IEnumerable</code>. It does this by calling <code>GetEnumerator</code> on the collection, which will return an <code>Enumerator</code>. Because of that, most collections are able to be traversed using an indexer and the for loop construct.

You can get the index of the current iteration of a foreach loop using LINQ's `Select` method, but it may not be efficient. A simpler approach is to keep a count of the current iteration.

Ground truth:
You put position: relative on the container element, and then absolutely position children inside it. Unfortunately, you cannot put one image inside another. That's why I needed container div.

Code for positioning one image on top of another in HTML requires CSS width and height properties, not HTML attributes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The HTML <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes do not allow for units; you're likely thinking of the CSS <code>width:</code> and <code>height:</code> properties. You should also provide a content-type (<code>text/css</code>; see Espo's code) with the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag. Leaving <code>px;</code> in the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes might cause a rendering engine to balk.

The difference between #include <filename> and #include "filename" lies in the search order: the former searches system directories, while the latter searches the current directory first.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The sequence of characters between &lt; and > uniquely refer to a header, which isn't necessarily a file. If the <code>#include "file"</code> form is used, the implementation first looks for a file of the given name, if supported. If not (supported), or if the search fails, the implementation behaves as though the other (<code>#include &lt;file&gt;</code>) form was used.

An unsigned char provides a larger positive value range (up to 255) compared to a regular char, and can be used to directly convert objects to an array for examining representation and bit patterns.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In terms of direct values a regular char is used when the values are known to be between <code>CHAR_MIN</code> and <code>CHAR_MAX</code> while an unsigned char provides double the range on the positive end. For example, if <code>CHAR_BIT</code> is 8, the range of regular <code>char</code> is only guaranteed to be [0, 127] (because it can be signed or unsigned) while <code>unsigned char</code> will be [0, 255] and <code>signed char</code> will be [-127, 127].

Generated abstractive summary:
You can use the "using" statement in C# to ensure the disposal of objects with a definite start and end, such as transactions or operations that need to be explicitly cleaned up.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Basically, you can take advantage of the fact that the compiler will <strong>always</strong> call .Dispose on the "used" object. If you have something that needs to happen after a certain operation ... something that has a definite start and end ... then you can simply make an IDisposable class that starts the operation in the constructor, and then finishes in the Dispose method. This is also how the System.Transactions stuff works.

The difference between #include <filename> and #include "filename" is the order of search directories: <filename> searches predefined and system directories first, while "filename" searches the current directory first, then system directories.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> include tells the preprocessor to search in <code>-I</code> directories and in predefined directories first, then in the .c file's directory. The <code>"file"</code> include tells the preprocessor to search the source file's directory first, and then revert to <code>-I</code> and predefined. All destinations are searched anyway, only the order of search is different. A preprocessing directive of the form searches a sequence of implementation-defined places for a header identified uniquely by the specified sequence between the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> delimiters, and causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the header. A preprocessing directive of the form causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified by the specified sequence between the <code>"</code> delimiters. If this search is not supported, or if the search fails, the directive is reprocessed as if it read with the identical contained sequence (including <code>&gt;</code> characters, if any) from the original   directive.

2. svn:ignore property (stored in the repo, applied to directories, non-recursive)
3. svn:global-ignores property (requires SVN 1.8, inherited properties, applied to all descendant directories)

Use the svn status command to view unversioned files, and edit the svn:ignore property to ignore files.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Use the command svn status on your working copy to show the status of files, files that are not yet under version control (and not ignored) will have a question mark next to them. As for ignoring files you need to edit the svn:ignore property, read the chapter Ignoring Unversioned Items in the svnbook at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.props.special.ignore.html.

A view uses a query to pull data from the underlying tables. A materialized view is a table on disk that contains the result set of a query. Materialized views are primarily used to increase application performance when it isn't feasible or desirable to use a standard view with indexes applied to it. Materialized views can be updated on a regular basis either through triggers or by using the <code>ON COMMIT REFRESH</code> option.

Views evaluate data on query, while Materialized Views store query results in a table, improving performance by pre-resolving joins and allowing for faster query optimization. However, Materialized View data is only as up-to-date as its last refresh.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Views evaluate the data in the tables underlying the view definition at the time the view is queried. It is a logical view of your tables, with no data stored anywhere else. Materialized views are similar to regular views, in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement), however, the underlying query resultset has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view, you are querying a table, which may also be indexed. The downside though is that the data you get back from the materialized view is only as up to date as the last time the materialized view has been refreshed. Materialized views are most often used in data warehousing / business intelligence applications where querying large fact tables with thousands of millions of rows would result in query response times that resulted in an unusable application.

Generated abstractive summary:
A metaclass is the class of a class, defining how a class behaves. It's usually an instance of the `type` class, which is also a class itself. Metaclasses can be used as class factories, allowing you to perform actions when creating a class, such as registering or replacing the class. They can also define their own methods and "magic" methods, like `__add__` or `__iter__`, to customize class behavior.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves, a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass <code>type</code>. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the <code>__metaclass__</code> attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the <code>__metaclass__</code> global variable.

Model-View-Patterns (MVP and MVC) are software design patterns that separate presentation logic from business logic. 

MVP:

* The Presenter contains UI business logic for the View.
* The View and Model are decoupled, with the Presenter talking to the View through an interface.
* Two primary variations:
  - Passive View: The View is dumb and contains almost zero logic, with the Presenter managing state.
  - Supervising Controller: The Presenter handles user gestures, and the View binds to the Model directly.

Model-View-Controller (MVC):

* The Controller determines which View to display in response to any action.
* Every action in the View correlates with a call to a Controller along with an action.
* The View does not directly bind to the Model.

Presentation Model (Model-View-ViewModel):

* The View binds directly to a Presentation Model, which is a Model crafted specifically for the View.
* The Presentation Model exposes properties and commands for the View to bind to.
* This pattern is suitable for WPF applications.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In MVP, the Presenter contains the UI business logic for the View. In the MVC, the Controller is responsible for determining which View to display in response to any action including when the application loads.

Why do you want to load a 4+ GB file into memory, and consider writing a program to transform or process it instead.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
And unless it has a lot more than 4 GB in physical memory, your machine will slow down a lot and go swap file crazy. If you want to transform it, or do a search and replace, you may be better off writing a small quick program to do it.

The question requires more details, but one possible solution is to use a text editor that can load files larger than 4GB, such as TheGun, which can load files up to the available memory size.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
For example, TheGun, a very small text editor written in assembly language, claims to "<em>not have an effective file size limit and the maximum size that can be loaded into it is determined by available memory and loading speed of the file. To abstract the memory limit, I suppose one can use mapped memory. But then, if you need to edit the file, some clever method should be used, like storing in memory the local changes, and applying them chunk by chunk when saving.

A smart pointer is like a regular pointer, but automatically deletes the data it points to when it goes out of scope. Use it when objects need to be allocated with `new` and have a lifetime tied to a block of code, or when managing data members of classes. Don't use it when the pointer doesn't own the data, the smart pointer won't be destroyed, or when two smart pointers point to the same data.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A smart pointer is like a regular (typed) pointer, like "char*", except when the pointer itself goes out of scope then what it points to is deleted as well. You can use it like you would a regular pointer, by using "->", but not if you need an actual pointer to the data.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
A smart pointer is a class that manages the lifetime of an object, abstracting a raw C++ pointer. There are two main types: 

1. **Unique Pointers (std::unique_ptr)**: Destroy the object when the smart pointer goes out of scope, cannot be copied.
2. **Shared Pointers (std::shared_ptr)**: Destroy the object when the last reference to it is gone, can be copied, but may create dangling references and circular references.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A smart pointer is a class that wraps a 'raw' (or 'bare') C++ pointer, to manage the lifetime of the object being pointed to. If you feel you need to use pointers (first consider if you really do), you would normally want to use a smart pointer as this can alleviate many of the problems with raw pointers, mainly forgetting to delete the object and leaking memory.

A smart pointer is a class that overloads the -> and * operators, providing pointer-like behavior with additional features like reference counting and automatic destruction.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A smart pointer is simply a class that overloads the <code>-&gt;</code>  and <code>*</code> operators. Which means that your object semantically looks like a pointer but you can make it do way cooler things, including reference counting, automatic destruction etc.

To filter a Java Collection, use a custom interface `IPredicate` with a method `apply` that returns a boolean value. Implement this interface for specific types, and use a utility class to apply the predicate to a collection. Alternatively, use Java 8's closures and the `stream()` API for a more concise solution.

In A, the condition is TRUE because one of the set members is TRUE. In B, the condition is FALSE due to the UNKNOWN result from testing 3 against a set containing a NULL value.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In A, 3 is tested for equality against each member of the set, yielding (FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, UNKNOWN). In B, I think it is evaluating the condition as NOT (3 in (1,2,null)). NOT ( UNKNOWN ) yields UNKNOWN. So overall the truth of the condition is unknown, which at the end is essentially treated as FALSE.

Choose between optimistic and pessimistic locking based on data importance: use optimistic for non-critical reads and pessimistic for exact data operations to avoid dirty reads and deadlocks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Optimistic assumes that nothing's going to change while you're reading it. Pessimistic assumes that something will and so locks it. Most web applications are fine with dirty reads - on the rare occasion the data doesn't exactly tally the next reload does. It's often worth setting your transactions to read-committed or no-lock to avoid deadlocks while reading.

Optimistic Locking checks for changes before updating a record, using a version number or timestamp, and re-tries if the record has changed. Pessimistic Locking locks a record exclusively until it's finished with, providing better integrity but requiring careful application design to avoid Deadlocks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, take note of a version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or checksums/hashes) and check that the version hasn't changed before you write the record back. Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it.

A `staticmethod` is a method that knows nothing about the class or instance, while a `classmethod` is a method that gets the class as its first argument, useful for creating class factories.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A <strong>staticmethod</strong> is a method that knows nothing about the class or instance it was called on. A <strong>classmethod</strong>, on the other hand, is a method that gets passed the class it was called on, or the class of the instance it was called on, as first argument. This is useful when you want the method to be a factory for the class: since it gets the actual class it was called on as first argument, you can always instantiate the right class, even when subclasses are involved.

Singletons are problematic because they hide dependencies, violate the single responsibility principle, cause tight coupling, make testing difficult, and require test ordering.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Because you hide the dependencies of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces. They violate the single responsibility principle: by virtue of the fact that they control their own creation and lifecycle. They inherently cause code to be tightly coupled. They carry state around for the lifetime of the application.

Generated abstractive summary:
Bitwise shift operators shift the bits of a binary number to the left or right. A left shift by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2^N, while a right shift by N is equivalent to dividing by 2^N and rounding to zero. Bitshifting can be used for fast multiplication and division by powers of 2, and is commonly used in low-level programming for graphics and other applications.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte. The bits don't rollover; they are discarded. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N. Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2N and rounding to zero.

Generated abstractive summary:
Bit shifting operators in C++ shift bits in a binary number. There are three operators: 

* `>>` (arithmetic right shift) shifts bits to the right, preserving the sign bit.
* `>>>` (logical right shift) shifts bits to the right, padding with zeros.
* `<<` (left shift) shifts bits to the left, equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2.
 
These operators can be applied to integer values and are used for efficient multiplication and division by powers of 2.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The bit shifting operators do exactly what their name implies. They shift bits. <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the left shift operator, and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts. All of these operators can be applied to integer values (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, possibly <code>short</code> and <code>byte</code> or <code>char</code>). In some languages, applying the shift operators to any datatype smaller than <code>int</code> automatically resizes the operand to be an <code>int</code>.

Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level programming, used for accessing specific bit-fields in bytes, words, or dwords.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming. Accessing these bit-fields for reading/writing is the most common usage. <strong>Explanation</strong> In order to obtain the value of green ONLY, which starts at offset 5 and ends at 10 (i.e. 6-bits long), you need to use a (bit) mask, which when applied against the entire 16-bit pixel, will yield only the bits we are interested in. The appropriate mask is 0x7E0 which in binary is 0000011111100000 (which is 2016 in decimal). To apply a mask, you use the AND operator (&amp;).

PODs (Plain Old Data) in C++ are types that have no "magic" or additional behavior, including: built-in types, pointers, enums, const/volatile types, and classes/structs/arrays of PODs with no non-static members, constructors, or destructors.

Extractive summary:
A POD is a type (including classes) where the C++ compiler guarantees that there will be no "magic" going on in the structure: for example hidden pointers to vtables, offsets that get applied to the address when it is cast to other types (at least if the target's POD too), constructors, or destructors.

The main difference between a framework and a library is that a library is a set of functions you call, while a framework is a design with built-in behavior that you insert your code into.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I think that the main difference is that frameworks follow the "Hollywood principle", i.e. "don't call us, we'll call you." A <strong>library</strong> is essentially a set of  functions that you can call, these  days usually organized into classes. A <strong>framework</strong> embodies some abstract  design, with more behavior built in.

A framework calls your code, inverting control and structuring your code differently, unlike a library which your code calls.

This is also called <em>inversion of control</em> - suddenly the framework decides when and how to execute you code rather than the other way around as with libraries.

Ground truth:
I like Cohens answer, but a more technical definition is: Your code calls a library. <strong>A framework calls your code</strong>. This means that a framework also have a much larger impact on how you have to structure your code.

A framework and a library are often confused terms, but a library is a collection of re-usable code that can be shared among multiple applications, whereas a framework is a more general term that can include a library, a collection of libraries, or any software needed for application development.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The difference between a bare library and the framework on Mac is that a framework can contain multiple different versions of the library. A software framework is a re-usable  design for a software system (or  subsystem). A software framework may  include support programs, code  libraries, a scripting language, or  other software to help develop and  glue together the different components  of a software project. So I'd say a library is just that, "a library". It is basically a file containing re-usable code that can usually be shared among multiple applications (you don't have to write the same code over and over again).

Polymorphism allows a class instance to behave like another class in its inheritance tree. Overriding is a function in a subclass that replaces a function from its parent class, while polymorphism is in effect. Overloading is defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

Ground truth:
<strong>Polymorphism</strong> is the ability of a class instance to behave as if it were an instance of another class in its inheritance tree, most often one of its ancestor classes. An <strong>override</strong> is a type of function which occurs in a class which inherits from another class. An override function "replaces" a function inherited from the base class, but does so in such a way that it is called even when an instance of its class is pretending to be a different type through polymorphism.

Generated abstractive summary:
A function is a block of code that receives arguments and returns a result, while a method is a function owned by an object or class, invoked through the object/class and with additional attributes describing its behavior.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Let's say a function is a block of code (usually with its own scope, and sometimes with its own closure) that may receive some arguments and may also return a result. A method is a function that is owned by an object (in some object oriented systems, it is more correct to say it is owned by a class).

In OO, "method" and "function" are often used interchangeably, but technically, a function always returns the same result with the same arguments, whereas a method is typically associated with a class instance and may have state.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In OO world, the two are commonly used to mean the same thing. From a pure Math and CS perspective, a function will always return the same result when called with the same arguments ( f(x,y) = (x + y) ). A method on the other hand, is typically associated with an instance of a class.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
In object-oriented languages, a "method" is a function associated with an object, while a standalone function is simply called a "function." In C#, every function is bound to an object and is technically a "method," although developers often refer to them as "functions" due to the lack of distinction.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In OO languages such as Object Pascal or C++, a "method" is a function associated with an object. So, for example, a "Dog" object might have a "bark" function and this would be considered a "Method". In contrast, the "StrLen" function stands alone (it provides the length of a string provided as an argument). It is thus <em>just</em> a "function."

A function is a standalone code block that can be passed data and return a value, whereas a method is a code block associated with an object that can operate on the object's data.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A <strong>function</strong> is a piece of code that is called by name. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences: <li>A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. <li>A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).

Because Java is a garbage collected language, there is no direct equivalent of a destructor; instead, use a `close` method for cleanup and `finalize` for sanity checking.

Ground truth:
Because Java is a garbage collected language you cannot predict when (or even if) an object will be destroyed. Hence there is no direct equivalent of a destructor.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can be notified after an object has been destroyed using java.lang.ref.PhantomReference (actually, saying it has been destroyed may be slightly inaccurate, but if a phantom reference to it is queued then it's no longer recoverable, which usually amounts to the same thing). There is also finalize(), which looks like a destructor but doesn't behave like one.

Consider using multi-column indexes or a single covering index, and use the SQL Server tuning wizard to determine the best indexing scheme for your query or workload.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If an index is "covering", then there is no need to use anything but the index. Having multiple indexes, each on a single column may mean that only one index gets used at all - you will have to refer to the execution plan to see what effects different indexing schemes offer. You can also use the tuning wizard to help determine what indexes would make a given query or workload perform the best.

Use a single covering index with multiple columns for static queries, but be aware of the potential overhead and volatility costs.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
By putting multiple columns in your index, the optimizer will only have to access the table directly if a column is not in the index. The downside is that doing this can cost a lot of overhead, especially if the data is very volatile. Index tuning is as much instinct as science.

Ground truth:
The multi-column index can be used for queries referencing <em>all</em> the columns: On the other hand, at most one of the single-column index can be used (it would have to look up all records having Column1=1, and then check Column2 and Column3 in each of those).

Multiple indexes can be beneficial, but it depends on the specific queries and group by clauses used in your database. Consider creating indexes based on frequently used where clauses.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This article should get you on the right track: One thing to note, clustered indexes should have a unique key (an identity column I would recommend) as the first column. Secondly, if you are creating other indexes on your data and they are constructed cleverly they will be reused. <li>you sometimes search by state only. <li>you sometimes search by state and county. <li>you frequently search by state, county, zip. If you search by zip alone quite a lot then the above index will not be used (by SQL Server anyway) as zip is the third part of that index and the query optimiser will not see that index as helpful. You could then create an index on Zip alone that would be used in this instance.

A shallow copy points to the same referenced objects, while a deep copy creates new copies of referenced objects.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With a shallow copy, any object pointed to by the source is also pointed to by the destination (so that no referenced objects are copied). With a deep copy, any object pointed to by the source is copied and the copy is pointed to by the destination (so there will now be 2 of each referenced object). This recurses down the object tree.

Ground truth:
The variables A and B refer to different areas of memory, when B is assigned to A the two variables refer to the same area of memory. Later modifications to the contents of either are instantly reflected in the contents of other, as they share contents. The variables A and B refer to different areas of memory, when B is assigned to A the values in the memory area which A points to are copied into the memory area to which B points. Later modifications to the contents of either remain unique to A or B; the contents are not shared.

On Windows, the main differences between mutexes and binary semaphores are: 

1. Mutexes can only be released by the thread that has ownership, whereas semaphores can be released by any thread.
2. A thread can call a wait function on a mutex without blocking, but calling it twice on a binary semaphore without releasing in between will block.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A mutex can only be released by the thread which has ownership, i.e. the thread which previously called the Wait function, (or which took ownership when creating it). A semaphore can be released by any thread. A thread can call a wait function repeatedly on a mutex without blocking. However, if you call a wait function twice on a binary semaphore without releasing the semaphore in between, the thread will block.

Use <code>tnsping</code> to verify TNSNames, then try ODBC or TOra to connect to Oracle.

Extractive summary:
Once you have set up tnsnames correctly you could use ODBC or try TOra which will use your native oracle connection.

Ground truth:
@Warren and @DCookie have covered the solution, one thing to emphasise is the use of <code>tnsping</code>. You can use this to prove your TNSNames is correct before attempting to connect. Once you have set up tnsnames correctly you could use ODBC or try TOra which will use your native oracle connection. TOra or something similar (TOAD, SQL*Plus etc) will prove invaluable in debugging and improving your SQL.

Bus errors occur when the processor cannot access memory due to incorrect alignment, whereas segmentation faults occur when accessing memory that doesn't belong to the process, typically due to null, uninitialized, or deallocated pointers, or buffer overflows.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Bus errors are rare nowadays on x86 and occur when your processor cannot even attempt the memory access requested, typically: <li>using a processor instruction with an address that does not satisfy its alignment requirements. Segmentation faults occur when accessing memory which does not belong to your process, they are very common and are typically the result of: <li>using a pointer to something that was deallocated. <li>using an uninitialized hence bogus pointer. <li>using a null pointer. <li>overflowing a buffer.

Use 'class' for template parameters, as it avoids the overloaded meaning of 'typename' and is often easier to type.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In response to Mike B, I prefer to use 'class' as, within a template, 'typename' has an overloaded meaning, but 'class' does not. <code>larger_integer_t</code> is a dependent name, so it requires 'typename' to preceed it so that the parser can recognize that <code>larger_integer_t</code> is a type. <strong>class</strong>, on the otherhand, has no such overloaded meaning.

If it helps, you can mentally replace the word "static" with "shared". static $db_connection) can be shared among all instances of a type of object. Because $num_connections is static (shared), it will reflect the total number of active database objects. You may have seen this technique used to share database connections among all instances of a database class.

Ground truth:
<code>$this-&gt;</code> is used to refer to a specific instance of a class's variables (member variables) or methods. If it helps, you can mentally replace the word "static" with "shared". <strong>SELF::</strong>If you are coding <em>outside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you must call it using the object's name View::format_phone_number($phone_number);If you are coding <em>inside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you can <em>either</em> use the object's name View::format_phone_number($pn), OR you can use the self::format_phone_number($pn)  shortcut The same goes for static variables:<strong>Example:</strong> View::templates_path versus self::templates_path Inside the DB class, if we were referring to a static method of some other object, we would use the object's name:<strong>Example:</strong> Session::getUsersOnline(); But if the DB class wanted to refer to its own static variable, it would just say self:<strong>Example:</strong> self::connection;

When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the following issues:

1. Lazy loaded objects are subclasses and using `this.getClass() == o.getClass()` will return false.
2. Lazy loaded objects have null fields, so use getters in `hashCode()` and `equals()`.
3. Saving an object changes its state, so avoid using an id field in `hashCode()`, but use it in `equals()`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return <code>false</code>.

`Server.MapPath` returns the physical path of a virtual path. It can be used to get the current directory, parent directory, application root, or domain root. For example: 

- `Server.MapPath(".")` returns the current physical directory.
- `Server.MapPath("..")` returns the parent directory.
- `Server.MapPath("~")` returns the application root.
- `Server.MapPath("/")` returns the domain root.

Extractive summary:
<code>Server.MapPath("/")</code> returns the physical path to the root of the domain name (is not necessarily the same as the root of the application)

A non-static method requires access to instance-level data, which isn't available from a static context, so the compiler throws an error. Make the method static if it doesn't reference non-static members.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
if a method is not static, that "tells" the compiler that the method requires access to instance-level data in the class, (like a non-static field). This data would not be available unless an instance of the class has been created. If in fact the method does NOT reference any non-static member of the class, make the method static.

Ground truth:
And then I remember, there was this function circling around the 'net from the Quake Source code: BIGBLOCK Which basically calculates a square root, using Newton's approximation function (cant remember the exact name). It should be usable and might even be faster, it's from one of the phenomenal id software's game! This should be faster because it reduces the number of division operations done in naive square rooting down to a simple divide by 2 (actually a <code>* 0.5F</code> multiply operation) and replace it with a few fixed number of multiplication operations instead.

Dictionary is preferred over Hashtable due to its generic type, providing benefits like static type checking and reduced boxing.

Extractive summary:
In .NET, the difference between <code>Dictionary&lt;,&gt;</code> and <code>HashTable</code> is primarily that the former  is a generic type, so you get all the benefits of generics in terms of static type checking (and reduced boxing, but this isn't as big as people tend to think in terms of performance - there is a definite memory cost to boxing, though).

Generated abstractive summary:
At a theoretical level, binary semaphores and mutexes are equivalent. However, in practice, mutexes are a lightweight synchronization mechanism, often implemented using atomic test and set operations, while semaphores are a data structure with a count that interacts with the scheduler to block tasks until they can proceed.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The practical difference (in terms of the system services surrounding them) is that the implementation of a mutex is aimed at being a more lightweight synchronisation mechanism. A typical mutex implementation has a process or thread executing the test-and-set instruction and evaluating whether anything else had set the mutex. A semaphore is a synchronised data structure (typically using a mutex) that has a count and some system call wrappers that interact with the scheduler in a bit more depth than the mutex libraries would.

Ground truth:
It's entirely dependent upon the actual function and the meaning of the multiple values, and their sizes: <li>If they're related as in your fraction example, then I'd go with a struct or class instance. <li>If they're not really related and can't be grouped into a class/struct then perhaps you should refactor your method into two. <li>Depending upon the in-memory size of the values you're returning, you may want to return a pointer to a class instance or struct, or use reference parameters.

The last d digits of a perfect square can only take on certain values, which can be used to rule out possible squares by checking the remainder of n divided by b^d or m.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The last <code>d</code> digits (in base <code>b</code>) of a number <code>n</code> is the same as the remainder when <code>n</code> is divided by <code>b</code><code>d</code>, ie. in C notation <code>n % pow(b, d)</code>. 1.8% of remainders as possible squares. So depending on the cost of a modulus operation (ie. division) and a table lookup versus a square root on your machine, using this modulus might be faster. 110880 32-bit words is not much RAM these days and fetching a machine word is going to be faster than fetching a single bit.

Another approach uses prime decomposition to check if a number can be a perfect square, by dividing the number by squares of prime numbers until it reaches 1 or exceeds the original number.

Ground truth:
If every factor of the decomposition is even, then the number is a perfect square. First build a table of squares of prime numbers which are lower than 2^32. A solution would then be like this: BIGBLOCK Given nowadays' sqrt done in hardware and the need to compute prime numbers here, I guess this solution is way slower.

A proxy server acts on behalf of another computer, and there are two types: forward proxy and reverse proxy. 

**Forward Proxy:**
- A forward proxy retrieves data from a website on behalf of the original requestee.
- It is used when the client (X) cannot access the target website (Z) directly due to restrictions or blocks.
- Examples include accessing a blocked website, blocking spam, or limiting access to a forum.

**Reverse Proxy:**
- A reverse proxy server sits between the client (X) and the target website (Z), making Z invisible to the client.
- It is used to distribute traffic, protect the target website from attacks, or hide the target website's IP address.
- Examples include content distribution networks (CDNs), load balancing, and protecting against retaliation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
What is different this time compared to a "forward proxy," is that this time the user <code>X</code> does not know he is accessing <code>Z</code>, because the user <code>X</code> only sees he is communicating with <code>Y</code>. The server <code>Z</code> is invisible to clients and only the reverse proxy <code>Y</code> is visible externally. A reverse proxy requires no (proxy) configuration on the client side.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for data interchange, used for transmitting data between web services. It's a subset of JavaScript, but not all JavaScript is JSON. JSON consists of two structures: name/value pairs (objects) and ordered lists of values (arrays). It's commonly used in web services responses, and is preferred over XML due to its lightweight nature. In JavaScript, JSON is a string, and must be parsed using the `JSON.parse()` method to become a JavaScript object. The `JSON.stringify()` method can be used to convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string.

In short - JSON is a way of serializing in such a way, that it becomes JavaScript code. You can use this for several purposes. For one, it's a comfortable way to pass data from your server backend to your JavaScript code. You can also use it as a standalone serialization mechanism, which is simpler and takes up less space than XML.

The `continue` keyword in Java skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves to the next one. Without a label, it re-executes from the innermost loop's condition or update expression. With a label, it re-executes from the corresponding loop.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A <code>continue</code> statement without a label will re-execute from the condition the innermost <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> loop, and from the update expression of the innermost <code>for</code> loop. It is often used to early-terminate a loop's processing and thereby avoid deeply-nested <code>if</code> statements. Sometimes <code>continue</code> is also used as a placeholder in order to make an empty loop body more clear.

Generated abstractive summary:
The `continue` keyword moves to the next iteration of a loop, and can be a maintenance issue if not used carefully, as its effect may not be immediately clear.

Extractive summary:
These can be maintenance timebombs because there is no immediate link between the <code>continue</code>/<code>break</code> and the loop it is continuing/breaking other than context; add an inner loop or move the "guts" of the loop into a separate method and you have a hidden effect of the <code>continue</code>/<code>break</code> failing.

Ground truth:
As others have already said, <code>continue</code> moves along to the next iteration of the loop, while <code>break</code> moves out of the enclosing loop.

To run a Linux service as a different user, consider: 

1. Using setuid() or the setuid-file flag.
2. Creating a daemon that calls setuid() to use root privileges and then drops them.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If you intend to write your own daemon, then I recommend calling setuid().This way, your process can <li>Make use of its root privileges (e.g. open log files, create pid files). <li>Drop its root privileges at a certain point during startup.

A method to determine if an integer's square root is an integer, implemented in three steps: 

1. Filter out obvious non-square numbers (negative numbers, numbers ending in 5, etc.)
2. Check if the number is a square modulo 255 using a precomputed table
3. If not, use Hensel's lemma to iteratively refine the square root estimate.

Extractive summary:
</code>To actually check if the residue is a square, I look up the answer in a precomputed table.<code>if( bad255[y] )    return false;// However, I just use a table of size 512</code>

Ground truth:
I figured out a method that works ~35% faster than your 6bits+Carmack+sqrt code, at least with my CPU (x86) and programming language (C/C++). <li>First, filter out obvious answers. This includes negative numbers and looking at the last 4 bits. <li>Next, check if it's a square modulo 255 = 3 * 5 * 17. Because that's a product of three distinct primes, only about 1/8 of the residues mod 255 are squares. <li>Finally, try to compute the square root using a method similar to Hensel's lemma. Complete, tested code follows, including the precomputed tables. BIGBLOCK

`fill_parent` (deprecated, equivalent to `MATCH_PARENT` in API Level 8+) and `wrap_content` are layout attributes that determine a View's size based on its content or parent layout. 

- `fill_parent`: Expands to take up available space within its parent layout.
- `wrap_content`: Expands only to fit its content.

Extractive summary:
Setting a View's size to wrap_content will force it to expand only far enough to contain the values (or child controls) it contains.

Ground truth:
It's used to set a View or Layouts size based on either it's contents or the size of it's parent layout rather than explicitly specifying a dimension. <strong><code>fill_parent</code></strong> (deprecated and renamed <code>MATCH_PARENT</code> in API Level 8 and higher) Setting the layout of a widget to fill_parent will force it to expand to take up as much space as is available within the layout element it's been placed in. Setting a top level layout or control to fill_parent will force it to take up the whole screen. <strong><code>wrap_content</code></strong> Setting a View's size to wrap_content will force it to expand only far enough to contain the values (or child controls) it contains. For layout elements it will resize the layout to fit the controls / layouts added as its children.

An `unsigned char` in C/C++ has all its bits participating in determining its value and is explicitly unsigned. When converting an `int` value to `unsigned char`, the value is adjusted to fit the new range by adding or subtracting the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until it's within range.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object. Second, <code>unsigned char</code> is explicitly stated unsigned. If the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or   subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type   until the value is in the range of the new type.

Big O notation is a way to describe how much time or space an algorithm takes, usually expressed as a function of the number of elements it operates on (n). Common examples include O(n), O(n^2), and O(n log n), where "n" is the number of elements. For example, searching for an item in an array takes O(n) time because you have to look at each element, and sorting an array using bubble sort takes O(n^2) time because you have to compare each item with every other item.

Extractive summary:
You would have to look on Each element and as "Are you the correct element/item?" Ok 6 is in the right position, moving forward! Let's move that, Ok the list changed, we need to start from the begining now!

Apologies for any confusion caused. Each of these is an operation or a problem. One can notice that we've assumed the worst case scenario here. How? Something to think about. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time.

Ground truth:
Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: <strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> You can't compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers. But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful; Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else.

- **Quadratic complexity (O(n^2))**: Time increases by a factor of n^2 (e.g., 1 item: 1 second, 10 items: 100 seconds).
- **Linear complexity (O(n))**: Time increases by a factor of n (e.g., 1 item: 1 second, 10 items: 10 seconds).
- **Constant complexity (O(1))**: Time remains constant (e.g., 1 item: 1 second, 10 items: 1 second).
- **Logarithmic complexity (O(log n))**: Time increases by a log of the input value (e.g., 1 item: 1 second, 10 items: 2 seconds, 100 items: 3 seconds).

Big O notation describes how an algorithm's resource use (time or memory) scales with input size, giving insight into its fundamental nature and performance characteristics, crucial for choosing efficient algorithms when dealing with large input sizes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Big O describes the fundamental scaling nature of an algorithm.</strong> It cuts to the bone and gives only information about the scaling nature of an algorithm, specifically how the resource use (think time or memory) of an algorithm scales in response to the "input size". Because software deals with problems that may differ in size by factors up to a trillion.

Generated abstractive summary:
Java generics allow runtime type checking by using a Class object, which can be passed to the Stack constructor, enabling type-safe array creation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Java generics work by checking types at compile time and inserting appropriate casts, but <em>erasing</em> the types in the compiled files. This makes generic libraries usable by code which doesn't understand generics (which was a deliberate design decision) but which means you can't normally find out what the type is at run time. The public <code>Stack(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz,int capacity)</code> constructor requires you to pass a Class object at run time, which means class information <em>is</em> available at runtime to code that needs it. This then means that you can create an array object of the appropriate type in your constructor, which means that the type of the objects you store in your collection will have their types checked at the point they are added to the collection.

Implementing `Runnable` is generally better than extending `Thread` because it allows for loose coupling with concurrency choices. However, consider using `Callable` and `FutureTask` for better concurrency management.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>tl;dr: implements Runnable is better. In general, I would recommend using something like <code>Runnable</code> rather than <code>Thread</code> because it allows you to keep your work only loosely coupled with your choice of concurrency. <strong>Caveat:</strong> Around here, I strongly discourage the use of raw Threads. Another option that allows you to stay closer to Runnables is a ThreadPoolExecutor.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>ids</code> must be unique where as <code>class</code> can be applied to many things. In general, use <code>id</code> whenever you want to refer to a specific element and <code>class</code> when you have a number of things that are all alike. For instance, common <code>id</code> elements are things like <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>sidebar</code>.

Generated abstractive summary:
Classes are for general styles that can be applied to multiple elements, while IDs are unique identifiers for a single element, allowing for both specific and common styling.

Extractive summary:
When I do JavaScript or CSS development, I typically use IDs to access/manipulate a very specific HTML element, and I use classes to access/apply styles to a broad range of elements.

Ground truth:
Classes are like categories. Classes are used to apply general styles or styles that can be applied across multiple HTML elements. IDs are identifiers. They're unique; no one else is allowed to have that same ID. IDs are used to apply unique styles to an HTML element.

An analogy comparing HTML "id" and "class" attributes: Think of "id" as a unique student ID and "class" as a shared class title, where multiple students can be part of the same class.

Extractive summary:
However, many students can and will share at least one <strong>Class</strong> with each other. It's okay to put multiple students under one <strong>Class</strong> title, such as Biology. When giving <strong>Rules</strong> over the school intercom system, you can give <strong>Rules</strong> to a <strong>Class</strong>: "Tomorrow, all students are to wear a red shirt to Biology class." "Jonathan Sampson is to wear a green shirt tomorrow."

Ground truth:
Perhaps an analogy will help understanding the difference: Student <strong>ID</strong> cards are distinct. No two students on campus will have the same student <strong>ID</strong> card. However, many students can and will share at least one <strong>Class</strong> with each other.

To add to existing answers, precise brightness calculation requires converting to linear color space, doing a weighted average, and accounting for monitor gamma.

Extractive summary:
All these equations work kinda well in practice, but if you need to be very precise you have to first convert the color to linear color space (apply inverse image-gamma), do the weight average of the primary colors and - if you want to display the color - take the luminance back into the monitor gamma.

Ground truth:
The luminance difference between ingnoring gamma and doing proper gamma is up to 20% in the dark grays.

The issue with cloning an array of objects in JavaScript is that it creates shallow copies, leaving circular object references. A deep copy is not possible for cyclic graphs, which are common in some data structures, requiring a custom, multi-pass cloning method to handle specialized data structures.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is nothing wrong with the way you cloned it...  the same result would occur using Array.slice(). The reason your deep copy is having problems is because you're ending up with circular object references. If you need a deep copy of an Array of Objects with circular references I believe you're going to have to code your own method to handle your specialized data structure, such that it is a multi-pass clone: <li>On round one, make a clone of all objects that don't reference other objects in the array. <li>On round two, link the objects together.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Cloning an array of objects in JavaScript can be problematic for cyclic graphs. One possible solution is to use a counter to track copied objects, referencing existing copies instead of re-creating them. After copying, a second pass is needed to reset references to null to free memory.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I'd do it with a variable <code>copyCount</code> which increases by 1 every time you copy in your code. An object that has a lower <code>copyCount</code> than the current copy-process is copied. If not, the copy, that exists already, should be referenced. This makes it necessary to link from the original to its copy. You'd have to make a second pass where you set all copy-references to Null.

A simple hack to determine if an integer's square root is an integer uses a single long value as a bit array, eliminating possible squares and calling a separate isPerfectSquare function for potential cases, reducing execution time to about 1/3 compared to the original method.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The sqrt call is not perfectly accurate, as has been mentioned, but it's interesting and instructive that it doesn't blow away the other answers in terms of speed. So why is it slow? Because Java is actually calling a C routine through JNI, and it's actually slower to do so than to call a Java subroutine, which itself is slower than doing it inline. In C++, I suspect all the complex alternatives would lose on speed, but I haven't checked them all.What I did, and what Java people will find usefull, is a simple hack, an extension of the special case testing suggested by A. Rex.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I used java BigInteger and a slightly modified version of Newton's method, one that works better with integers. The problem was that exact squares n^2 converged to (n-1) instead of n because n^2-1 = (n-1)(n+1) and the final error was just one step below the final divisor and the algorithm terminated. It was easy to fix by adding one to the original argument before computing the error. A simple modification also lets you quickly calculate floor(sqrt(x)) instead of the closest integer.

Validate XML files by using an XSD file while generating the XML content, either with SAX-based writers or Stax-based libraries like Woodstox.

Extractive summary:
Alternatively if you use Stax for writing content (or a library that uses or can use stax), Woodstox can also directly support validation when using XMLStreamWriter.

Ground truth:
One more answer: since you said you need to validate files you are <strong>generating</strong> (writing), you might want to validate content while you are writing, instead of first writing, then reading back for validation. You can probably do that with JDK API for Xml validation, if you use SAX-based writer: if so, just link in validator by calling 'Validator.validate(source, result)', where source comes from your writer, and result is where output needs to go. Alternatively if you use Stax for writing content (or a library that uses or can use stax), Woodstox can also directly support validation when using XMLStreamWriter.

The "right" way to iterate through an array in Ruby depends on the programmer and the project, but common methods include using `each`, `each_with_index`, or a block with an index, such as `|value, index|`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
As for the original question, "What is the __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through an array in Ruby? ", well, I think the core way (i.e. without powerful syntactic sugar or object oriented power) is to do: But Ruby is all about powerful syntactic sugar and object oriented power, but anyway here is the equivalent for hashes, and the keys can be ordered or not: So, my answer is, "The __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through an array in Ruby depends on you (i.e. the programmer or the programming team) and the project.".

This error occurs when referencing a PostgreSQL table with a mixed-case spelling. Use double-quotes to delimit the identifier or add a schema to the search path.

Ground truth:
One common reason is that the table is defined with a mixed-case spelling, and you're trying to query it with all lower-case. Use double-quotes to delimit identifiers so you can use the specific mixed-case spelling as the table is defined. Re your comment, you can add a schema to the "search_path" so that when you reference a table name without qualifying its schema, the query will match that table name by checked each schema in order. You can check your current schema search path: You can change your schema search path:

The main difference between `div id` and `div class` is that an ID can be used only once per page, while a class can be used repeatedly. IDs are also useful for targeting specific elements with JavaScript, creating internal links, and serving as a form of documentation within the document.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. In contrast, you must use a class to set up alternating row colors on a table, as they are by definition going to be used more than once. An element with an ID can be the target of a piece of JavaScript that manipulates the element or its contents in some way. Finally, if you make your IDs clear and logical, they can serve as a sort of Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦Â¸Âelf documentationÃ©Â?within the document.

Ground truth:
In my experience, interfaces are best  used when you have several classes  which each need to respond to the same  method or methods so that they can be  used interchangeably by other code  which will be written against those  classes' common interface. The best  use of an interface is when the  protocol is important but the  underlying logic may be different for  each class.

Objective-C method parameters are specified clearly, one by one, to avoid ambiguity and reduce errors, especially for methods with many arguments.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Yes; the Objective-C method syntax is like this for a couple of reasons; one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying are. This also reduces ambiguity between the order of the method parameters, ensuring that you pass the object parameter first, <em>then</em> the index parameter. In a language such as C++, you would simply overload the number method to allow different data types to be passed as the argument; however, in Objective-C, this syntax allows several different variants of the same function to be implemented, by changing the name of the method for each variant of the function.

There are three ways to return multiple values from a function in C#: 

1. Using `ref` parameters to modify the calling code's stack.
2. Using `out` parameters, which are like `ref` but with a compiler-enforced rule that the value must be set before returning.
3. Creating a type that encapsulates both values and returning that.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can use <code>ref</code> parameters: Another similar approach is to use an <code>out</code> parameter. The final approach (and the best in most cases) is to create a type that encapsulates both values and allow the function to return that:

Key differences between Interfaces and Abstract Classes: 

- Interfaces can't have implementations, while Abstract Classes can.
- More than one interface can be implemented, but a class can only inherit from one Abstract Class.
- Interfaces are less prone to breaking changes, while Abstract Classes are more flexible.
- Interfaces can be applied to value types (structs), but Abstract Classes can't.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Interfaces can't have any concrete implementations. Abstract base classes can. More than one interface can be implemented on a class. A class can only derive from a single abstract base class. Abstract base classes can be modified in v2+ without breaking the API. Changes to interfaces are breaking changes.

Ground truth:
For languages like C# and Java, there is a difference, but in other languages like C++ there is not. OO theory doesn't differentiate the two, merely the syntax of language. An abstract class is a class with both implementation and interface (pure virtual methods) that will be inherited. Interfaces generally do not have any implementation but only pure virtual functions.

Generated abstractive summary:
In .NET, the key differences between interfaces and abstract classes are: 

- Interfaces have no state or implementation, while abstract classes can have state and/or implementation.
- A class that implements an interface must provide all its methods, but a class that inherits from an abstract class does not have to implement all its abstract methods.
- Interfaces can be multiple-inherited, but abstract classes cannot.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<li>interfaces can have no state or implementation <li>a class that implements an interface must provide an implementation of all the methods of that interface <li>abstract classes may contain state (data members) and/or implementation (methods) <li>abstract classes can be inherited without implementing the abstract methods (though such a derived class is abstract itself) <li>interfaces may be multiple-inherited, abstract classes may not (this is probably the key concrete reason for interfaces to exist separately from abtract classes - they permit an implementation of multiple inheritance that removes many of the problems of general MI). As general OO terms, the differences are not necessarily well-defined.

Access restriction on a class due to a restriction on the required library rt.jar, likely due to overriding a standard class and violating the Java license agreement.

Extractive summary:
"Applications that use this option for the purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed as doing  so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment binary code license."

Ground truth:
My guess is that you are trying to replace a standard class which ships with Java 5 with one in a library you have. This is not allowed under the terms of the license agreement, however AFAIK it wasn't enforced until Java 5. I have seen this with QName before and I "fixed" it by removing the class from the jar I had. You may not modify the JavaPlatform Interface ("JPI", identified as classes containedwithin the "java" package or any subpackages of the "java"package), by creating additional classes within the JPI orotherwise causing the addition to or modification of theclasses in the JPI. In the event that you create anadditional class and associated API(s) which (i) extendsthe functionality of the Java platform, and (ii) is exposedto third party software developers for the purpose ofdeveloping additional software which invokes suchadditional API, you must promptly publish broadly anaccurate specification for such API for free use by alldevelopers. You may not create, or authorize yourlicensees to create, additional classes, interfaces, orsubpackages that are in any way identified as "java","javax", "sun" or similar convention as specified by Sun inany naming convention designation."

The difference between private, public, and protected inheritance is how the base class's public members are exposed from the derived class: 

- public: base class's public members are public
- protected: base class's public members are protected
- private: base class's public members are private

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<li>public -> base class's public members will be public (usually the default)   <li>protected -> base class's public members will be protected    <li>private -> base class's public members will be private As litb points out, public inheritance is traditional inheritance that you'll see in most programming languages. Private inheritance, something AFAIK peculiar to C++, is an "IMPLEMENTED IN TERMS OF" relationship. That is you want to <strong>use</strong> the public interface in the derived class, but don't want the user of the derived class to have access to that interface.

There are three accessors: 

- `public`: accessible by everything aware of the class.
- `protected`: accessible by the class itself, its children, and their children.
- `private`: only accessible by the class itself.

Inheritance:

- `public`: the inheriting class is aware of the parent class to all classes.
- `protected`: the inheriting class and its children are aware of the parent class.
- `private`: only the inheriting class is aware of the parent class.

Extractive summary:
The same happens with public, private and protected inheritance.

Ground truth:
<li>Everything that is aware of <code>Base</code> is also aware that <code>Base</code> contains <code>publicMember</code>. <li>Only the children (and their children) are aware that <code>Base</code> contains <code>protectedMember</code>. <li>No one but <code>Base</code> is aware of <code>privateMember</code>.

Passing data from one page to another in PHP can be done through GET (hidden fields, URL, or form), sessions, or POST (form). However, when passing sensitive data like filenames, always validate and check for security risks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Passing data in the request You could either embed it as a hidden field in your form, or add it your forms action URL Note this also illustrates the use of htmlentities and urlencode when passing data around. Passing data in the session Simply call session_start() at the start of each page, and you can get and set data into the $_SESSION array. Check it for validity! As you are clearly just getting started here, its worth reminding that this goes for any data which arrives in $_GET, $_POST or $_COOKIE - assume your worst enemy crafted the contents of those arrays, and code accordingly!

To pass a variable to the next page in PHP, you can use sessions, cookies, GET, or POST variables. Sessions are more secure than cookies, but both can be insecure. You can also use GET variables by adding them to the link or a hidden field in a form.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
HTML / HTTP is stateless, in other words, what you did / saw on the previous page, is completely unconnected with the current page. <em>Except</em> if you use something like sessions, cookies or GET / POST variables. Sessions and cookies are quite easy to use, with session being by far more secure than cookies. You can add the variable in the link to the next page: This will create a GET variable. Another way is to include a hidden field in a form that submits to page two: And then on page two: Just change the method for the form to <code>post</code> if you want to do it via post.

Python lambdas are useful for functional programming, making code shorter and clearer, and can be used for tasks such as filtering, creating function wrappers, combining iterable sequences, and sorting by alternate keys.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Python supports a style of programming called functional programming where you can pass functions to other functions to do stuff. (or even as <code>range(3,10,3)</code>), but there are many other, more sophisticated use cases where you can't use a list comprehension and a lambda function may be the shortest way to write something out.

Mercurial and Git are equivalent version control systems, with Mercurial having a bias towards non-destructive commands and a focus on clean and elegant design.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I work on Mercurial, but fundamentally I believe both systems are equivalent. Git has a strong focus on mutating this history graph (with all the consequences that entails) whereas Mercurial does not encourage history rewriting, but it's easy to do anyway and the consequences of doing so are exactly what you should expect them to be (that is, if I modify a changeset you already have, your client will see it as new if you pull from me). I chose Mercurial since it feels clean and elegant -- I was put off by the shell/Perl/Ruby scripts I got with Git. I like the blog post that compares Mercurial and Git with James Bond and MacGyver -- Mercurial is somehow more low-key than Git.

When you need an outer join the second syntax is <strong>not</strong> always required: I don't know the answer, but it is probably related to the fact that a <strong>join</strong> is more natural (syntactically, at least) than adding an expression to a <strong>where</strong> clause when you are doing exactly that: <strong>joining</strong>.

Using JOINs is more readable and separates table join criteria from result set restrictions, making SQL statements clearer and easier to understand.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Basically, when your FROM clause lists tables like so: BIGBLOCK the result is a cross product of all the rows in tables A, B, C. Then you apply the restriction <code>WHERE tableA.id = tableB.a_id</code> which will throw away a huge number of rows, then further ... <code>AND tableB.id = tableC.b_id</code> and you should then get only those rows you are really interested in. Using the JOIN notation makes the SQL statement <em>more</em> readable (IMHO, not using joins turns the statement into a mess). Using the cross product, you need to provide join criteria in the WHERE clause, and that's the problem with the notation. You should definitely use JOINs and keep the FROM clause a FROM clause, and the WHERE clause a WHERE clause.

The old SQL syntax for joining tables, using the `WHERE` clause, is being deprecated due to ambiguity issues, particularly with inner and outer joins. The new syntax, using the `JOIN` keyword, provides more control and clarity, allowing for more efficient query optimization.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The old syntax, with just listing the tables, and using the <code>WHERE</code> clause to specify the join criteria, is being deprecated in most modern databases. It's not just for show, the old syntax has the possibility of being ambiguous when you use both INNER and OUTER joins in the same query. So the old syntax is ambiguous. Enter the new syntax, with this you can choose. Additionally, the old way, by throwing a bunch of tables at the query optimizer, with a bunch of WHERE clauses, was akin to saying "here you are, do the best you can". With the new syntax, the query optimizer has less work to do in order to figure out what parts goes together.

You can use both a color and an image as a background, but if the image is larger, the color will not be visible.

Ground truth:
It's perfectly possible to use both a color and an image as background for an element. If the image is smaller than the element, you need to use the <code>background-position</code> style to place it to the right, and to keep it from repeating and covering the entire background you use the <code>background-repeat</code> style: BIGBLOCK Or using the composite style <code>background</code>: BIGBLOCK If you use the composite style <code>background</code> to set both separately, only the last one will be used, that's one possible reason why your color is not visible: BIGBLOCK

Ground truth:
Currently, <code>encrypt</code> is declared with <code>throws Exception</code> - however, in the body of the method, exceptions are caught in a try/catch block. I recommend you either: Regarding the compilation error you refer to: if an exception was thrown in the <code>try</code> block of <code>encrypt</code>, nothing gets returned after the <code>catch</code> block finishes. You could address this by initially declaring the return value as <code>null</code>:

The `transient` modifier in Java prevents fields from being serialized, making them "for in-memory use only" and not portable across different VMs.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Serialization systems other than the native java one can also use this modifier. Hibernate, for instance, will not persist fields marked with either <strong>@Transient</strong> or the <strong>transient</strong> modifier. I believe the figurative meaning of the modifier is "this field is for in-memory use only. Its non-portable". i.e. you can't rely on its value in another VM memory space.

An application server listens for requests on any channel, while a web server listens on TCP/IP for HTTP/HTTPS requests, primarily serving web pages.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
An application server is a machine (an executable process running on some machine, actually) that "listens" (on any channel, using any protocol), for requests from clients for whatever service it provides, and then does something based on those requests. A Web server is process running on a machine that "listens" specifically on TCP/IP Channel using one of the "internet" protocols, (http, https, ftp, etc..)  and does whatever it does based on those incoming requests... Generally, (as origianly defined), it fetched/generated and returned an html web page to the client, either fetched from a static html file on the server, or constructed dynamically based on parameters in the incoming client request.

Key differences between Web Server and Application Server: 

1. Web Server serves HTTP content, while Application Server serves HTTP and other protocols.
2. Web Server is designed for static content, while Application Server supports dynamic content and application-level services like connection pooling, transactions, and messaging.
3. Web Server is often integrated into Application Server, providing all the features of Web Server plus additional application services.
4. In production environments, a Web Server often acts as a reverse proxy to an Application Server, serving static content and forwarding dynamic requests.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Most of the times these terms Web Server and Application server are used interchangeably. <li>Web Server is designed to serve HTTP Content. App Server can also serve HTTP Content but is not limited to just HTTP. <li>Web Server is mostly designed to serve static content, though most Web Servers have plugins to support scripting languages like Perl, PHP, ASP, JSP etc. through which these servers can generate dynamic HTTP content. <li>Most of the application servers have Web Server as integral part of them, that means App Server can do whatever Web Server is capable of. <li>As web servers are well suited for static content and app servers for dynamic content, most of the production environments have web server acting as reverse proxy to app server.

Generated abstractive summary:
The distinction between application server and web server is fuzzy, with the terms often used differently depending on emphasis. Historically, they were distinct, but over time, web servers have evolved to include app server features, and vice versa. Today, many products, such as WebSphere and WebLogic, combine both web and app server capabilities.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Historically, they were different, but through the 90's these two previously distinct categories blended features and effectively merged. At this point is is probably best to imagine that the "App Server" product category is a strict superset of the "web server" category. Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads, more concurrency, and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability. When someone says "web server" you often think HTTP-centric, web UI, oriented apps. When someone says "App server" you may think "heavier loads, enterprise features, transactions and queuing, multi-channel communication (HTTP + more).

You're having trouble accessing a variable from another class because you're trying to use local variables instead of instance fields. To fix this, make the variables fields in the class and add getters for them. Then, pass the values to the constructor and store them in the fields.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Fields HEIGHT and WIDTH are inhereted from ImageObserver BIGBLOCK If width and height represent state of the frame, then you could refactorize them to fields, and write getters for them. Then, you could create a Constructor that receives both values as parameters BIGBLOCK If widht and height are going to be constant (after created) then you should use the <strong>final</strong> modifier. Also, the variables i use in  DrawCircle, should I have them in the  constructor or not? The way it is writen now, will only allow you to create <strong>one type of circle</strong>. If you wanÃ©ÂºÂt to create different circles, you should overload the constructor with one with arguments).

Generated abstractive summary:
Reactive programming is a programming paradigm where a program is viewed as a directed graph of nodes performing computations, connected by links that provide inputs to other nodes. When a node receives input, it triggers a cascade of computations, making the program "react" to external stimuli, similar to a reflex arc. It's suited for UI design and situations where asynchronous execution of computations is beneficial.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external "stimuli" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs "triggered" or "marked". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Reactive programming imports this "cascade of execution" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the "outside world" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs "reacts" to them. Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.

Functional reactive programming combines functional and reactive programming, allowing side-effect-free code to handle changing values over time, eliminating the need for mutable variables.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One way to get side-effect like behavior while still retaining a functional style is to use functional reactive programming. This is the combination of functional programming, and reactive programming. The basic idea behind reactive programming is that there are certain datatypes that represent a value "over time". This is why reactive programming and functional programming work so well together: reactive programming removes the need to mutate variables while still letting you do a lot of what you could accomplish with variable mutations. Here is a pretty good paper on functional reactive programming.

FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) is about representing dynamic values as first-class values that evolve over time. It captures these values directly, allowing for continuous and concurrent computation without the complexity of imperative concurrency. It's about combining behaviors and events to build a compositional model, using denotational semantics for a precise and simple meaning.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
So, what is FRP?You could have invented it yourself.Start with these ideas: <li>Dynamic/evolving values (i.e., values "over time") are first class values in themselves. <li>Behaviors are built up out of a few primitives, like constant (static) behaviors and time (like a clock), and then with sequential and parallel combination. <li>To account for discrete phenomena, have another type (family) of "events", each of which has a stream (finite or infinite) of occurrences. <li>To come up with the compositional vocabulary out of which all behaviors and events can be built, play with some examples. <li>So that you know you're on solid ground, give the whole model a compositional foundation, using the technique of denotational semantics, which just means that (a) each type has a corresponding simple &amp; precise mathematical type of "meanings", and (b) each primitive and operator has a simple &amp; precise meaning as a function of the meanings of the constituents.<em>Never, ever</em> mix implementation considerations into your exploration process. If you stick with these principles, I expect you'll get something more-or-less in the spirit of FRP. It's been quite a challenge to implement this model correctly and efficiently, but that's another story.

Generated abstractive summary:
`extern "C"` in C++ makes a function have 'C' linkage, allowing it to be called from C code, by preventing the compiler from mangling the function name with argument information.

Extractive summary:
A C compiler does not need to mangle the name since you can not overload function names in C.  When you state that a function has extern "C" linkage in C++, the C++ compiler does not add argument/parameter type information to the name used for linkage.

Ground truth:
extern "C" makes a function-name in C++ have 'C' linkage (compiler does not mangle the name) so that client C code can link to (i.e use) your function using a 'C' compatible header file that contains just the declaration of your function. Since C++ has overloading of function names and C does not, the C++ compiler cannot just use the function name as a unique id to link to, so it mangles the name by adding information about the arguments. If you care about the technicalities, they are listed in section 7.5 of the C++03 standard, here is a brief summary (with emphasis on extern "C"): <li>extern "C" is a linkage-specification <li>Every compiler is <em>required</em> to provide "C" linkage <li>a linkage specification shall occur only in namespace scope <li> all function types, function names and variable names have a language linkage  See Richard's Comment: Only function names and variable names with external linkage have a language linkage <li>two function types with distinct language linkages are distinct types even if otherwise identical <li>linkage specs nest, inner one determines the final linkage <li>extern "C" is ignored for class members <li>at most one function with a particular name can have "C" linkage (regardless of namespace) <li> extern "C" forces a function to have external linkage (cannot make it static)   See Richard's comment:    'static' inside 'extern "C"' is valid; an entity so declared has internal linkage, and so does not have a language linkage <li>Linkage from C++ to objects defined in other languages and to objects defined in C++ from other languages is implementation-defined and language-dependent.

Generated abstractive summary:
`extern "C"` prevents C++ name mangling, allowing a function to be accessed directly by its symbol name.

Extractive summary:
So if you specify a function to be extern C, the compiler doesn't performs name mangling with it and it can be directly accessed using its symbol name as the function name.

Ground truth:
Because C++ allows overloading and has many features that C does not Ã©Â?like classes, member functions, exception specifications - it is not possible to simply use the function name as the symbol name. To solve that, C++ uses so-called name mangling, which transforms the function name and all the necessary information (like the number and size of the arguments) into some weird-looking string processed only by the compiler and linker.

To remove an invalid remote branch reference in Git, use `git prune <name>` to delete stale tracking branches, or `git rm <name>` to remove the remote and its configuration. Alternatively, `git branch -rd origin/badbranch` or `git push origin :badbranch` can be used to delete a local or remote branch respectively.

Ground truth:
<strong>prune</strong> Deletes all stale tracking branches under &lt;name>. <strong>rm</strong> Remove the remote named &lt;name>. I suspected the OP had done something that left their tree in an inconsistent state that caused it to behave a bit strangely, and <code>git gc</code> was required to fix up the left behind cruft. <em>Usually</em>  <code>git branch -rd origin/badbranch</code> is sufficient for nuking a local tracking branch , or <code>git push origin :badbranch</code> for nuking a remote branch, and <em>usually</em> you will <em>never</em> need to call <code>git gc</code>

Ground truth:
I would suggest you break down your code, i.e. comment out bits until the error goes away and then put the code back until it comes back and you should find the error it. The reason I ask is this error is related to how you're telling hibernate to ascertain the persistent state of an object (i.e. whether an object is persistent or not). The error could be happening because hibernate is trying to persist and object that is already persistent.

The main differences between `const int*`, `const int * const`, and `int const *` are:

- `const int*` declares a variable pointer to a constant integer.
- `const int * const` declares a constant pointer to a constant integer.
- `int const *` is an alternative syntax for `const int *` and also declares a variable pointer to a constant integer.

`const` applies to the immediate left (or right) of it, determining whether the pointer or what it points to is constant.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The simplest use is to declare a named constant. It also works with pointers but one has to be careful where __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________const__________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ to determine whether the pointer or what it points to is constant or both. Basically __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________const__________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ applies to whatever is on its immediate left (other than if there is nothing there in which case it applies to whatever is its immediate right).

- `const X* p` means the object is const.

Ground truth:
<code>const X* p</code> means "p points to an X that is const": the X object can't be changed via p. <code>X* const p</code> means "p is a const pointer to an X that is non-const": you can't change the pointer p itself, but you can change the X object via p. <code>const X* const p</code> means "p is a const pointer to an X that is const": you can't change the pointer p itself, nor can you change the X object via p.

In short, I find the easiest way to remember the rule is that the "const" goes after the thing it applies to. So in your question, "int const *" means that the int is constant, while "int * const" would mean that the pointer is constant.

There is no perfect way to compare objects in JavaScript, but two methods can be used: 

1. A fast and limited method for simple objects without methods and DOM nodes.
2. A slow and more generic method that compares objects without digging into prototypes, then recursively compares properties and constructors.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Unfortunately there is no perfect way, unless you use <code>_proto_</code> recursively and access all non-enumerable properties, but this works in Firefox only. So the best I can do is to guess usage scenarios. <strong>1) Fast and limited.</strong> <strong>2) Slow and more generic.</strong>

The "Out of memory" exception doesn't mean the system is low on physical memory, but rather that the program can't find a large enough contiguous block of memory to allocate. This is often due to fragmentation, where available memory is broken into small blocks, making it hard to allocate large blocks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In short, and very simplified, "Out of memory" does not really mean that the amount of available memory is too small. The most common reason is that within the current address space, there is no contiguous portion of memory that is large enough to serve the wanted allocation.

Use a User Defined Function (UDF) to remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server 2005 and lower, or use the native date and time components in SQL Server 2008 and higher.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I, personally, almost always use User Defined functions for this if dealing with SQL Server 2005 (or lower version), however, it should be noted that there are specific drawbacks to using UDF's, especially if applying them to WHERE clauses (see below and the comments on this answer for further details). If using SQL Server 2008 (or higher) - see below. If using a UDF, it should be noted that you should try to avoid using the UDF as part of a WHERE clause in a query as this will greatly hinder performance of the query. The main reason for this is that using a UDF in a WHERE clause renders that clause as non-sargable, which means that SQL Server can no longer use an index with that clause in order to improve the speed of query execution. Of course, the absolute <em>best</em> approach for this is to use SQL Server 2008 (or higher) and separate out your dates and times, as the SQL Server database engine is then natively providing the individual date and time components, and can efficiently query these independently without the need for a UDF or other mechanism to extract either the date or time part from a composite datetime type.

I prefer the DATEADD/DATEDIFF because: <li>varchar is subject to language/dateformat issues <li>float relies on internal storage <li>it extends to work out first day of month, tomorrow etc by changing "0" base For SQL Server 2008+, you can CAST to <code>date</code>. Or just use <code>date</code> so no time to remove.

Use the DATEADD method for removing time from a datetime in SQL Server, as it's more robust and the performance difference is negligible.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This magic number method performs slightly faster than the DATEADD method. Considering the fact that DateAdd is meant for this purpose and is more robust, I'd say use DateAdd.

The keyword `self` doesn't just refer to the current class; it also bypasses the vtable for non-static members, allowing direct access to the current class's implementation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The keyword self does <strong>NOT</strong> refer merely to the 'current class', at least not in a way that restricts you to static members. Within the context of a non-static member, <code>self</code> also provides a way of bypassing the vtable (see wiki on vtable) for the current object. Just as you can use <code>parent::methodName()</code> to call the parents version of a function, so you can call <code>self::methodName()</code> to call the current classes implementation of a method.

A clustered index stores data physically close together on disk, speeding up retrieval of records with similar values, but only one per table can exist.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A clustered index means you are telling the database to store close values actually close to one another on the disk. This has the benefit of rapid scan / retrieval of records falling into some range of clustered index values.

Clustered index stores rows in the same order as the index, allowing only one per table. Non-clustered index has a separate list of pointers to the physical rows, allowing multiple indexes per table, but increasing write time and making reads from the clustered index faster.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index. Therefore, there can be only one clustered index. With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows. You can have many non clustered indexes, although each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records. It is generally faster to read from a clustered index if you want to get back all the columns.

There are four types of casts in C++: 

1. `const_cast` removes const or volatile properties.
2. `static_cast` casts between integer types or pointers to related types.
3. `dynamic_cast` casts at run-time for inheritance, returning NULL or throwing an exception if it fails.
4. `reinterpret_cast` performs a bitwise cast between any pointer or integral type.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types. Static cast is also used to cast pointers to related types, for  example casting void* to the appropriate type. Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy).

You can't run PHP directly on a link click without leaving the page, but you can use AJAX to send a request to the server, allowing PHP to run and return data to the browser for further processing.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You cant run PHP when a user clicks on a link without leaving the page unless you use AJAX. PHP is a serverside scripting language, meaning the second that the browser sees the page, there is no PHP in it. In an AJAX Solution, basically the page uses javascript to send a page request to another page on your domain. Javascript then gets whatever you decide to <code>echo</code> in the response, and it can parse it and do what it wants from there.

Public inheritance is visible to all, protected inheritance is visible to child classes, and private inheritance is only visible to the derived class itself.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If you inherit publicly from another class, everybody knows you are inheriting and you can be used polymorphically by anyone through a base class pointer. If you inherit protectedly only your children classes will be able to use you polymorphically. If you inherit privately only yourself will be able to execute parent class methods.

Here are the differences between private, public, and protected inheritance in C++:

- **Public inheritance**: IS-A relationship, used for polymorphism (e.g., a button is-a window).
- **Protected inheritance**: Implemented-in-terms-of, rarely useful, used for empty base class optimization.
- **Private inheritance**: Implemented-in-terms-of, used for size-critical classes, traits, or containment.

Additionally, public, protected, and private members have different access levels:

- **Public member**: Aggregate, accessors
- **Protected member**: Providing enhanced access for derived classes
- **Private member**: Keep implementation details

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>public</strong> member <li>Aggregate <li>Accessors <strong>protected</strong> member <li>Providing enhanced access for derived classes <strong>private</strong> member <li>Keep implementation details

"A TCP RST was received, closing the connection due to a disconnect or data loss."

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This means that a TCP RST was received and the connection is now closed. This occurs when a packet is sent from your end of the connection but the other end does not recognize the connection; it will send back a packet with the RST bit set in order to forcibly close the connection. This can happen if the other side crashes and then comes back up or if it calls <code>close()</code> on the socket while there is data from you in transit, and is an indication to you that some of the data that you previously sent may not have been received.

You need to use a suffix to change the type of the literal, i.e. The suffix <code>LL</code> makes the literal into type <code>long long</code>. C is not "smart" enough to conclude this from the type on the left, the type is a property of the literal itself, not the context in which it is being used.

The type "long long" in C/C++ depends on the compiler mode, and its usage may change with future C++ versions.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
long long is not part of the C++ standard but only (usually) supported as extension. If the number is even too big for long the result is implementation-defined (probably just a number of type long int that has been truncated for backward compatibility). In this case you have to explicitly use the LL suffix to enable the long long extension (on most compilers). If the number cannot be represented in long the compiler will automatically try to use long long even without LL suffix.

Ground truth:
You will see that exception if the InitialContext class has neither default properties for the JNDI service provider nor explicitly configured server properties. Set the Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY environment property to the class name of the initial context implementation that you are using.

Using `new String(byte[])` and `getBytes()` may not return equal byte arrays due to character encoding differences.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Using <code>new String(byOriginal)</code> and converting back to <code>byte[]</code> using <code>getBytes()</code> doesn't guarantee two <code>byte[]</code> with equal values. This is due to a call to <code>StringCoding.encode(..)</code> which will encode the <code>String</code> to <code>Charset.defaultCharset()</code>.

Use explicit character encoding when converting byte array to string and vice versa to avoid encoding issues.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The root problem is (I think) that you are unwittingly using a character set for which: Be explicit about the character encoding you are using; i.e. Use the right character set for your byte data ... or alternatively one (such as "Latin-1" where all byte sequences map to valid Unicode characters. If your bytes are (really) binary data and you want to be able to transmit / receive them over a "text based" channel, use something like Base64 encoding ... which is designed for this purpose.

Ground truth:
<code>String</code>s are for text, <code>byte[]</code> is for binary data, and the only really sensible thing to do is to avoid converting between them unless you absolutely have to. If you really must use a <code>String</code> to hold binary data then the safest way is to use Base64 encoding.

Ground truth:
If you want to wait for some condition, you need a lock object - Thread.class object is a very bad choice - it is a singleton AFAIK so synchronizing on it (except for Thread static methods) is dangerous.

The `wait()` method can only be called by the thread that holds the object's lock, and it causes the current thread to wait, not the specified thread.

Ground truth:
First, as others have said, <code>obj.wait()</code> can only be called if the current thread holds the primitive mutex for <code>obj</code>. The second (more important) problem is that <code>thread.wait()</code> does not do what you seem to be expecting it to do.

`isinstance` checks for inheritance, making it suitable for Python's duck typing, whereas `type()` checks for identity of types, rejecting instances of subtypes. The preferred solution is to use "duck typing" by trying to use the argument as if it was of a certain type, catching exceptions and trying something else if it fails.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
To summarize the contents of other (already good!) answers, <code>isinstance</code> caters for inheritance (an instance of a derived class <em>is an</em> instance of a base class, too), while checking for equality of <code>type</code> does not (it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes, AKA subclasses). For the purpose of this answer, the key thing to retain about ABCs (beyond an arguably more natural placement for TM DP functionality, compared to the classic Python alternative of mixin classes such as UserDict.DictMixin) is that they make <code>isinstance</code> (and <code>issubclass</code>) much more attractive and pervasive (in Python 2.6 and going forward) than they used to be (in 2.5 and before), and therefore, by contrast, make checking type equality an even worse practice in recent Python versions than it already used to be.

Generated abstractive summary:
`assert` is a function that terminates the program if its argument is false, used for debugging to make unexpected conditions more obvious.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>assert</code> will terminate the program (usually with a message quoting the assert statement) if its argument turns out to be false. It's commonly used during debugging to make the program fail more obviously if an unexpected condition occurs. The corollary of this is that your program should <em>never</em> rely on the assert macro running. From the combination of the program calling abort() and not being guaranteed to do anything, asserts should only be used to test things that the developer has assumed rather than, for example, the user entering a number rather than a letter (which should be handled by other means).

Ground truth:
It is a function that will halt program execution if the value it has evaluated is false. It is designed to be used for testing the assumptions you have made.

To login to Git over SSH once, use `ssh-agent` and `ssh-add` to securely store your private key. This allows all SSH-family commands to use your private key without needing to enter your passphrase every time.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Try <code>ssh-add</code>, you need <code>ssh-agent</code> to be running and holding your private key Once you log in, the idea is to run <code>ssh-add</code> once and only once, in order to give the agent your passphrase, to decode your key. On OSX (err, <em>macOS</em>), GNOME and KDE systems, <code>ssh-agent</code> is usually launched automatically for you. I will go through the details in case, like me, you also have a Cygwin or other windows environment where this most certainly is not done for you. There are various ways to automatically run the agent. As the man page explains, you can run it so that it is a parent of all your login session's other processes. Alternatively, you can run the agent as an ordinary child, save the environment settings in a file, and source that file in every shell when it starts. My Cygwin system needed it done manually, so I did this in my <code>.profile</code> and I have <code>.bashrc</code> source <code>.profile</code>: BIGBLOCK You can also just run <code>ssh-add</code> and if it fails start an agent.1.

To avoid entering your SSH password every time, use certificates with public key authentication or an SSH agent like `ssh-agent` or `keychain`, which can securely store your passphrase for system-wide use.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I think there are two different things here. The first one is that normal SSH authentication requires the user to put the account's password (where the account password will be authenticated against different methods, depending on the sshd configuration). With certificates you still have to put a password, but this time is the password of your private key (that's independent of the account's password). If you want to avoid putting the certificate's password every time then you can use ssh-agent, as pointed out by DigitalRoss The exact way you do this depends on Unix vs Windows, but essentially you need to run ssh-agent in the background when you log in, and then the first time you log in, run ssh-add to give the agent your passphrase. All ssh-family commands will then consult the agent and automatically pick up your passphrase. But this is on that particular shell. With keychain you can do the same thing as ssh-agent but "system-wide".

The main difference between application and web servers is their processing model and session management: Web servers handle requests, while application servers maintain explicit sessions in memory.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In Web server processing model, the focus is on handling requests; the notion of "session" is pretty much virtual. In Application server the session is usually more explicit and often takes form of an object living in memory of the application server for the entire duration of the "session".

A web server serves web content over HTTP, while an application server hosts business logic and processes, offering services like APIs, object management, state management, and resource management.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
On a first hand, a web server serves web content (HTML and static content) over the HTTP protocol. On the other hand, an application server is a container upon which you can build and expose business logic and processes to client applications through various protocols including HTTP in a n-tier architecture. An application server thus offers much more services than an web server which typically include: <li>A (proprietary or not) API <li>Object life cycle management, <li>State management (session), <li>Resource management (e.g. connection pools to database), <li>Load balancing, fail over...

@staticmethod function is nothing more than a function defined inside a class. It is callable without instantiating the class first. ItÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ definition is immutable via inheritance. @classmethod function also callable without instantiating the class, but its definition follows Sub class, not Parent class, via inheritance.

Generated abstractive summary:
In Python, `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` are used to define methods that can be called without an instance of a class. 

- `@classmethod` methods have the class as the first argument (e.g. `cls`) and are typically used for alternative constructors or to modify class state.
- `@staticmethod` methods do not have `self` or `cls` as arguments and are used to group related functions with a class, but can be called from an instance or the class.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Below is the usual way an object instance calls a method. The object instance, <code>a</code>, is implicitly passed as the first argument. <strong>With classmethods</strong>, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument instead of <code>self</code>. One use people have found for class methods is to create inheritable alternative constructors. <strong>With staticmethods</strong>, neither <code>self</code> (the object instance) nor  <code>cls</code> (the class) is implicitly passed as the first argument. They behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an instance or the class: Staticmethods are used to group functions which have some logical connection with a class to the class.

The default charset in Java is cached and set upon JVM initialization, and its value is not affected by changing the "file.encoding" property.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I don't know if this is a bug or not but 1.6 changes this implementation and uses the cached charset: JVM 1.5: JVM 1.6: When you set the file encoding to <code>file.encoding=Latin-1</code> the next time you call <code>Charset.defaultCharset()</code>, what happens is, because the cached default charset isn't set, it will try to find the appropriate charset for the name <code>Latin-1</code>. This name isn't found, because it's incorrect, and returns the default <code>UTF-8</code>. As for why the IO classes such as <code>OutputStreamWriter</code> return an unexpected result, the implementation of <code>sun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder</code> (witch is used by these IO classes) is different as well for JVM 1.5 and JVM 1.6. The JVM 1.6 implementation is based in the <code>Charset.defaultCharset()</code> method to get the default encoding, if one is not provided to IO classes. JVM 1.6: JVM 1.5:

Looks like undefined behaviour. The "file.encoding" property is not required by the J2SE  platform specification; it's an internal detail of Sun's implementations and  should not be examined or modified by user code. The preferred way to change the default encoding used by the VM and the runtime  system is to change the locale of the underlying platform before starting your  Java program.

Ground truth:
First, Latin-1 is the same as ISO-8859-1, so, the default was already OK for you. When you do that, looks like Charset resets to UTF-8, from looking at the source. That at least explains most of the behavior. I'm guessing it isn't quite dealing with encoding via the same mechanism, which is weird.

The default charset in Java is determined by system properties and locale, but the implementation can be inconsistent, leading to differences between `Charset.defaultCharset()` and `OutputStreamWriter` default charset.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Looking into the implementation of the classes, it is caused by: <li>Charset.defaultCharset() is not caching the determined character set in Java 5. <li>Setting the system property "file.encoding" and invoking Charset.defaultCharset() again causes a second evaluation of the system property, no character set with the name "Latin-1" is found, so Charset.defaultCharset defaults to "UTF-8". <li>The OutputStreamWriter is however caching the default character set and is probably used already during VM initialization, so that its default character set diverts from Charset.defaultCharset() if the system property "file.encoding" has been changed at runtime.

Generated abstractive summary:
Posix governs interoperability and portability across Unix-like systems, ensuring that software written on one system (e.g. Linux) can run on others (e.g. IBM's AIX).

Extractive summary:
Hence, when developers write a program under a Posix compliant system such as for example Linux, it is generally, not always, guaranteed to run on another posix compliant system such as IBM's AIX system or other commercial variants of Unix.

Ground truth:
Posix governs interoperability, portability, and in other areas such as the usage and mechanism of fork, permissions and filesystem standards such as /etc, /var, /usr and so on . Posix is a good thing to have as such it eases the software development for maximum portability which it strives for.

POSIX is a set of standards for distinguishing UNIX and UNIX-like systems, created by the US government for procurement purposes, but it's loosely defined and not fully implementable, making it mostly useful for legal and argumentative purposes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
POSIX is a set of standards which attempts to distinguish "UNIX" and UNIX-like systems from those which are incompatible with them. So, for example, Microsoft's NT was written with enough POSIX conformance to qualify for some bids ... even though the POSIX subsystem was essentially useless in terms of practical portability and compatibility with UNIX systems. Various other standards for UNIX have been written over the decades. They most exist for argumentation, legal wrangling and other dysfunctional reasons.

There's no straightforward way to control the `java.io.tmpdir` environment variable, but on Windows, it reflects the `TMP` environment variable, while on Linux and Solaris, it defaults to `/tmp/`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It isn't reassuring that there's a way to do this other than on Windows. On Windows, OpenJDK's <code>get_temp_directory()</code> function makes a Win32 API call to <code>GetTempPath()</code>; this is how on Windows, Java reflects the value of the <code>TMP</code> environment variable. On Linux and Solaris, the same <code>get_temp_directory()</code> functions return a static value of <code>/tmp/</code>.

The main differences between urllib, urllib2, and requests modules are:

- urllib2 provides extra functionality like specifying headers and a more declarative approach to requests.
- urllib2's Request class is more verbose, but it's the preferred choice for new code.
- urllib has the urlencode function, which is not available in urllib2.
- urllib2 has handlers for advanced URL support.
- For new code, use the URL opener from urllib2, but import urllib for utility functions.
- On Google App Engine, all three libraries are wrappers for the URL Fetch API, with similar limitations.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
urllib2 provides some extra functionality, namely the <code>urlopen()</code> function can allow you to specify headers (normally you'd have had to use httplib in the past, which is far more verbose.) More importantly though, urllib2 provides the <code>Request</code> class, which allows for a more declarative approach to doing a request: BIGBLOCK The short answer is, unless you're working with legacy code, you probably want to use the URL opener from urllib2, but you still need to import into urllib for some of the utility functions.

Generated abstractive summary:
JSONP is a technique that allows cross-domain requests by wrapping server responses in a JavaScript function, allowing the client to execute a callback function with the server's response. It works by passing a "callback" parameter to the server, which returns the response wrapped in the specified function. This allows the client to handle the response, but also loses control over the request and error handling.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle.

Generated abstractive summary:
JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a Java view technology that generates dynamic content by combining server-side code (Java) with client-side templates (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). It's compiled into a servlet class and executed by the servlet container, sending the output to the client. 

Servlets are Java applications that intercept client requests and generate responses, configured through web.xml or annotations. They're reused for each request and provide access to request and response objects.

JSF (JavaServer Faces) is a component-based MVC framework built on top of Servlets, providing components via taglibs for use in JSP or Facelets. It's more suited to templating and provides a FacesServlet to handle request-response work, allowing for a JSP or Facelets page as the View and a JavaBean as the Model.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
JSP is a Java view technology running on the server machine which allows you to write template text in client side languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ect.). Servlet is a Java application programming interface (API) running on the server machine, which intercepts requests made by the client and generates/sends a response. JSF is a component based MVC framework which is built on top of the Servlet API and provides components via taglibs which can be used in JSP or any other Java based view technology such as Facelets.

A common misunderstanding among Java developers: calling `forward()`, `sendRedirect()`, or `sendError()` after response has been committed will throw `java.lang.IllegalStateException`. To fix, add a `return` statement or use an `else` block.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A common misunderstanding among starters is that they think that the call of a <code>forward()</code>, <code>sendRedirect()</code>, or <code>sendError()</code> would magically exit and "jump" out of the method block, hereby ignoring the remnant of the code. If the <code>if</code> statement calls a <code>forward()</code> and you're afterwards calling <code>sendRedirect()</code> or <code>sendError()</code>, then below exception will be thrown: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot call sendRedirect() after the response has been committed To fix this, you need either to add a <code>return;</code> statement afterwards BIGBLOCK ... or to introduce an else block. BIGBLOCK To naildown the root cause in your code, just search for any line which calls a <code>forward()</code>, <code>sendRedirect()</code> or <code>sendError()</code> without exiting the method block or skipping the remnant of the code. Another probable cause is that the servlet writes to the response while a <code>forward()</code> will be called, or has been called in the very same method. Solution is obvious, just don't write to the response in the servlet.

Generated abstractive summary:
Binary trees are useful when balanced, with applications including:

1. Binary search trees (O(log N) lookup time)
2. Multi-way trees (O(log N) lookup time, often used in indexing)
3. Binary heaps (higher keys are above or equal to lower ones)
4. Hash trees (similar to hash tables)
5. Abstract syntax trees (compilation of computer languages)
6. Huffman trees (data compression)
7. Routing trees (network traffic)

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A non-balanced binary search tree is actually useful for little more than educating students about data structures. That's because, unless the data is coming in in a relatively random order, the tree can easily degenerate into its worst-case form, which is a linked list, since simple binary trees are <em>not</em> balanced. Binary trees become truly useful when you balance them. This involves rotating sub-trees through their root node so that the height difference between any two sub-trees is less than or equal to 1. Of course, they become even more useful when you make them balanced <em>multi-way</em> trees rather than binary tress. That means that each node holds more than one item (technically, they hold N items and N+1 pointers, a binary tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree  with 1 item and 2 pointers). I've written database software optimised for the hardware where a node is exactly the size of a disk block (say, 512 bytes) and you put as many keys as you can into a single node. The <em>pointers</em> in this case were actually record numbers into a fixed-length-record direct-access file separate from the index file (so record number <code>X</code> could be found by just seeking to <code>X * record_length</code>). As to other uses for binary trees, there are a great many, such as: <li>Binary heaps where higher keys are <em>above or equal to</em> lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right); <li>Hash trees, similar to hash tables; <li>Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages; <li>Huffman trees for compression of data; <li>Routing trees for network traffic.

Binary trees are mostly useful in the form of balanced trees (such as Red-Black or AVL trees), which guarantee O(logn) operations. They can be used for sorting, searching, inserting, and deleting in O(nlogn) time, and are often used in maps, sets, and databases.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Normal binary trees may end up being a list (or almost list) and are not really useful in applications using much data. Balanced trees are often used for implementing maps or sets.They can also be used for sorting in O(nlogn), even tho there exist better ways to do it. Also for searching/inserting/deleting Hash tables can be used, which usually have better performance than binary search trees (balanced or not). An application where (balanced) binary search trees would be useful would be if searching/inserting/deleting and sorting would be needed. It still would be O(nlogn) but with a smaller constant factor and no extra space needed (except for the new array, assuming the data has to be put into an array).

There are three types of casts in C++:

1. `static_cast`: Performs no runtime checks, used when the type is known.
2. `dynamic_cast`: Performs runtime checks, returns null or throws an exception if the cast fails, used when the type is unknown.
3. Regular cast (C-style cast): Combines multiple casts, but is less safe and less preferred, as it doesn't use `dynamic_cast`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>static_cast</code> is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. <code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering <code>dynamic_cast</code>. After much pulling out of hair I discovered that the <code>foreach</code> loops were the culprits.

Use padding for consistent spacing within an element, and margins for minor adjustments and positioning.

Extractive summary:
So I generally start off by using paddings to get everything '<code>packed</code>' and then use margins for minor tweaks.

Ground truth:
The thing about margins is that you don't need to worry about the element's width.

Binary trees can be used to recursively evaluate mathematical expressions, such as (1+3)*2, where each node's value is determined by its children, mimicking reverse polish notation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One interesting example of a binary tree that hasn't been mentioned is that of a recursively evaluated mathematical expression. Basically each node of the tree has a value that is either inherent to itself or is evaluated by recursively by operating on the values of its children. This use of a binary tree is akin to reverse polish notation in a sense, in that the order in which operations are performed is identical. Also one thing to note is that it doesn't necessarily have to be a binary tree, it's just that most commonly used operators are binary. At its most basic level, the binary tree here is in fact just a very simple purely functional programming language.

Binary trees have various applications, including:

1. Binary Search Tree: Used in search applications like maps and sets.
2. Binary Space Partition: Used in 3D video games for rendering objects.
3. Binary Tries: Used in high-bandwidth routers for storing router-tables.
4. Hash Trees: Used in p2p programs and image-signatures.
5. Heaps: Used in priority-queues, scheduling, and A* algorithm.
6. Huffman Coding Tree: Used in compression algorithms like JPEG and MP3.
7. GGM Trees: Used in cryptographic applications.
8. Syntax Tree: Used in compilers and calculators for parsing expressions.
9. Treap: Used in wireless networking and memory allocation.
10. T-tree: Used in databases for storing data in memory.

Binary trees are preferred over n-ary trees for searching due to their simplicity and comparable performance.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
To squabble about the performance of <em>binary-trees</em> is meaningless - they are not a data structure, but a family of data structures, all with different performance characteristics. Applications of binary trees <li>Binary Search Tree - Used in <em>many</em> search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the <code>map</code> and <code>set</code> objects in many languages' libraries. <li>Binary Space Partition - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered. <li>Binary Tries - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables. <li>Hash Trees - used in p2p programs and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available. <li>Heaps - Used in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* <em>(path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including robotics and video games)</em>. Also used in heap-sort. <li>Huffman Coding Tree (Chip Uni) - used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats. <li>GGM Trees - Used in cryptographic applications to generate a tree of pseudo-random numbers. <li>Syntax Tree - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions. <li>Treap - Randomized data structure used in wireless networking and memory allocation. <li>T-tree - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so. In a (balanced) binary tree with <code>m</code> nodes, moving from one level to the next requires one comparison, and there are <code>log_2(m)</code> levels, for a total of <code>log_2(m)</code> comparisons. In contrast, an n-ary tree will require <code>log_2(n)</code> comparisons <em>(using a binary search)</em> to move to the next level.

Static methods in Java are treated as global and not bound to an object instance, making method overriding impossible, but overloading is allowed.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can <em>overload</em> static method, that's ok. But you can not <em>override</em> a static method, because class are no first-class object. You can use reflection to get the class of an object at run-time, but the object that you get does not parallel the class hierarchy. A static method is a global function; as a consequence there is also no notion of polymorphism and, therefore, method overriding makes no sense. You can invoke a static method through an object <code>obj1.staticMethod()</code> but that really syntactic sugar for <code>MyClass.staticMethod()</code> and should be avoided.

In general it doesn't make sense to allow 'overriding' of static methods as there would be no good way to determine which one to call at runtime. In the case of Java, one could imagine a language definition where it is possible to 'override' static methods as long as they are called through an object instance. However, all this would do is to re-implement regular class methods, adding redundancy to the language without really adding any benefit.

Ground truth:
Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so. Personally I see the strong points of IoC and I really like them but I tend to avoid IoC whenever possible because it turns your software into a collection of classes that no longer constitute a "real" program but just something that needs to be put together by XML configuration or annotation metadata and would fall (and falls) apart without it.

<strong>Answer in one line:</strong> or even shorter starting with Python 3.6 using <code>random.choices()</code>: <strong>A cryptographically more secure version; see https://stackoverflow.com/a/23728630/2213647:</strong> In the example above, we use <code>[</code> to create the list, but we don't in the <code>id_generator</code> function so Python doesn't create the list in memory, but generates the elements on the fly, one by one (more about this here). Therefore <code>random.choice(chars) for _ in range(size)</code> really is creating a sequence of <code>size</code> characters.

You can use the `typeof` operator, `hasOwnProperty` method, or `in` operator to check if a property exists in JavaScript. The `typeof` operator returns `"undefined"` if the property is either undefined or doesn't exist. `hasOwnProperty` checks if the property exists physically on the object, while `in` checks all properties reachable up the prototype chain.

Extractive summary:
As you can see, <code>hasOwnProperty</code> returns <code>false</code> and the <code>in</code> operator returns <code>true</code> when checking the <code>toString</code> method, this method is defined up in the prototype chain, because <code>obj</code> inherits form <code>Object.prototype</code>.

The main difference between HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME in PHP is that HTTP_HOST is obtained from the HTTP request header and is client-controlled, while SERVER_NAME is defined in the server config and is more reliable. However, SERVER_NAME's value can be affected by server configuration, specifically the UseCanonicalName directive in Apache HTTPD, which must be set to "on" in the VirtualHost entry of httpd.conf.

The <code>HTTP_HOST</code> is obtained from the HTTP request header and this is what the client actually used as "target host" of the request. The <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is defined in server config.

Generated abstractive summary:
Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods because they don't have an implied "this" reference like virtual methods do. This means they can't access object variables and methods, and attempting to do so would shift the parameters on the stack. Java's design choice is rooted in performance and the language's history, and it's a fundamental difference from languages like Ruby that have dynamic methods and a different approach to class objects.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In a virtual method, the first parameter is implied: a reference to the object itself and when called from within the object, the compiler automatically adds <code>this</code>. There is no difference for static methods - they still have a fixed signature. However, by declaring the method static you have explicitly stated that the compiler must not include the implied object parameter at the beginning of that signature. Because of this difference between the two; virtual methods always have a reference to the context object (i.e. <code>this</code>) so then it is possible to reference anything within the heap that belong to that instance of the object. But with static methods, since there is no reference passed, that method cannot access any object variables and methods since the context is not known. This is just something you will have to accept when working with Java (or C#).

Generated abstractive summary:
The READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level allows dirty reads, relaxing the locking property to maintain high concurrency. However, it may lead to reading invalid data. It's not recommended as a general solution, but can be used for simple, read-only queries. An alternative is the READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT level, which increases database performance by reading snapshots of data changes rather than live data.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
But  here's what I think: "In theory there  is no difference between theory and  practice. In practice there is." I would never recommend using <code>nolock</code>  as a general "good for what ails you"  snake oil fix for any database  deadlocking problems you may have. But in practice adding <code>nolock</code> to queries that you absolutely know are simple, straightforward read-only affairs never seems to lead to problems... <strong>As long as you know what you're doing.</strong>

Generated abstractive summary:
A bias neuron is a neuron in a neural network that emits a constant value (1) and is connected to all neurons in the next layer, allowing for easier adjustment of the network's behavior by controlling the threshold value (bias) without affecting the weights. This enables a single neural network to represent multiple cases, such as the AND and OR boolean functions, and can be used to implement m-of-n functions.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1. Since the bias neuron  emits 1 the weights, connected to the  bias neuron, are added directly to the  combined sum of the other weights  (equation 2.1), just like the t value  in the activation functions.1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions. Perceptrons can represent all of the  primitive boolean functions AND, OR,  NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR).

Generated abstractive summary:
A bias in neural networks adds another dimension to the input space, preventing the output from being zero when all inputs are zero. This is particularly useful for functions like AND and OR, where a straight line drawn on the input plane would go through zero without bias, but can be placed anywhere with bias.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Using a bias, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe effectively adding another dimension to your input space, which always takes the value one, so youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe avoiding an input vector of all zeros. You donÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ lose any generality by this because your trained weight matrix needs not be surjective, so it still can map to all values previously possible. Without bias, this straight line has to go through zero, whereas with bias, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe free to put it anywhere.So, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂl see that without bias youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe facing a problem with the AND function, since you canÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ put both (1,-1) <em>and</em> (-1,1) to the negative side. With a bias, however, itÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ easy to draw the line.

You must understand the difference between a class and an instance of that class. To solve the error, instantiate the class and use instance methods, not static ones.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Static fields and methods are shared with all instances. They are for values which are specific to the class and not a specific instance. To solve your problem, you need to instantiate an instance (create an object) of your class so the runtime can reserve memory for the instance (otherwise, different instances would overwrite each other which you don't want).

Generated abstractive summary:
A LEFT JOIN is not faster than an INNER JOIN. In fact, it's generally slower due to the extra work of null-extending results. However, there's one circumstance where a LEFT JOIN might be faster: when tables are very small (under 10 rows) and lack sufficient indexes, leading to a nested loop join being faster than a hash match join.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results. It would also be expected to return more rows, further increasing the total execution time simply due to the larger size of the result set. Reflecting further on this, I could think of one circumstance under which a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> might be faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, and that is when: <li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows); <li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query. If you run this and view the execution plan, you'll see that the <code>INNER JOIN</code> query does indeed cost more than the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, because it satisfies the two criteria above. It's because SQL Server wants to do a hash match for the <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but does nested loops for the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>; the former is <em>normally</em> much faster, but since the number of rows is so tiny <em>and</em> there's no index to use, the hashing operation turns out to be the most expensive part of the query. Because of the size, the hash table version is actually slower. But increase it to 50 elements, or 5000 elements, and the list version slows to a crawl, because it's O(N) vs. O(1) for the hashtable. But change this query to be on the <code>ID</code> column instead of <code>Name</code> and you'll see a very different story. So the conclusion is more or less what I mentioned several paragraphs above; this is almost certainly an indexing or index coverage problem, possibly combined with one or more very small tables. Those are the only circumstances under which SQL Server <em>might</em> sometimes choose a worse execution plan for an <code>INNER JOIN</code> than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.

To use UTL_FILE.FOPEN() in Oracle, you can use either the UTL_FILE_DIR parameter in the INIT.ORA file or a directory object. Directory objects are more secure and allow for finer-grained privileges, but require the exact file path.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Since Oracle 9i there are two ways or declaring a directory for use with UTL_FILE. The older way is to set the INIT.ORA parameter UTL_FILE_DIR. The value can like any other PATH variable; it accepts wildcards. The alternative approach is to declare a directory object. Directory objects require the exact file path, and don't accept wildcards. In either case, the <code>oracle</code> OS user must have read and/or write privileges <em>on the OS directory</em>. So we cannot use either approach to expose a directory on our local PC to a process running on a remote database server.

A mutex and a binary semaphore differ in scope (within process vs across processes), speed (mutex is faster), and behavior when acquiring multiple times (mutex allows, semaphore blocks).

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
i) Scope __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ The scope of mutex is within a process address space which has created it and is used for synchronization of threads. Whereas semaphore can be used across process space and hence it can be used for interprocess synchronization. ii) Mutex is lightweight and faster than semaphore. iii) Mutex can be acquired by same thread successfully multiple times with condition that it should release it same number of times. Whereas in case of semaphore if same process tries to acquire it again it blocks as it can be acquired only once.

You can parse dates from a custom format using DateTime::createFromFormat or manually using str_replace and date manipulation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can parse dates from a custom format (as of PHP 5.3) with DateTime::createFromFormat BIGBLOCK If you do not want to (or cannot) use PHP 5.3, then a full list of available date/time formats which strtotime accepts is listed on the <em>Date Formats</em> manual page. That page more thoroughly describes the fact that <code>m/d/Y</code> is inferred over <code>d/m/Y</code> (but you can, as mentioned in the answers here, use <code>d-m-Y</code>, <code>d.m.Y</code> or <code>d\tm\tY</code>).

Generated abstractive summary:
Objects in C# do not require manual disposal like in C++ because the Garbage Collector automatically frees memory when objects are no longer in use. However, objects that implement IDisposable should be disposed of using a using block. Variable scope in C# is different from C++ as it only has class and function level scope, not statement block scope. Objects are created on the managed heap and their lifetime is managed by the runtime, so there is no need to worry about object destruction. Setting object references to null does not affect the object's lifetime, but rather indicates to the Garbage Collector that it is no longer needed.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Objects never go out of scope in C# as they do in C++. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. In practice, you don't have to worry about destruction, it just works and it's great :) <strong>EDIT</strong> On variable scope. To properly explain that aspect of CLR, I'll need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#. In both languages the variable can only be used in the same scope as it was defined - class, function or a statement block enclosed by braces. The subtle difference, however, is that in C#, variables cannot be redefined in a nested block. In C++, this is perfectly legal: BIGBLOCK In C#, however you get a a compiler error: BIGBLOCK Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned. Whenever a C++ variable, allocated on the stack, goes out of scope it gets destructed. In CLR, objects (i.e. reference types) are <strong>always</strong> created on the managed heap. In a way, C# objects are a lot like objects that are created using <code>new</code> syntax in C++ - they are created on the heap but unlike C++ objects, they are managed by the runtime, so you don't have to worry about destructing them. Jon Skeet compared object references in Java to pieces of string that are attached to the balloon, which is the object. Same analogy applies to C# object references. They simply point to a location of the heap that contains the object. Continuing down the balloon analogy, it would seem logical that once the balloon has no strings attached to it, it can be destroyed. In fact this is exactly how reference counted objects work in non-managed languages. Except this approach doesn't work for circular references very well. Imagine two balloons that are attached together by a string but neither balloon has a string to anything else. Under simple ref counting rules, they both continue to exist, even though the whole balloon group is "orphaned".

There's no need to set fields to null, but it's recommended to:

* Dispose of unmanaged resources
* Unsubscribe from events when no longer needed
* Set fields holding delegates or expressions to null if no longer needed to aid garbage collection.

Ground truth:
From experience I'd also advise you to do the following: <li>Unsubscribe from events if you no longer need them. <li>Set any field holding a delegate or an expression to null if it's no longer needed. A good place to do this is in Dispose(), but sooner is usually better. Setting fields referencing other objects to null and clearing collections on disposal can really help the GC figure out what objects it can remove from memory.

The correct answer is that it is eligible for collection sometime <strong>during</strong> the call to <code>DoSomething</code>.

An index in SQL is a B-tree that can be either clustered (physically ordering rows) or non-clustered (binary tree with row indexes in leaf nodes), used to increase search speed with a time complexity of O(log N).

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Well in general index is a <code>B-tree</code>. There are two types of indexes: clustered and nonclustered. Clustered index creates a physical order of rows (it can be only one and in most cases it is also a primary key - if you create primary key on table you create clustered index on this table also). Nonclustered index is also a binary tree but it doesn't create a physical order of rows. Indexes are used to increase the speed of search.

Big O notation describes the upper limit of an algorithm's running time or space, relative to the size of the input (n). It's a way to say an algorithm's time or space is always less than a constant times a function of n.

Extractive summary:
When we say some algorithm is O(f(n)) we are saying that the running time (or space required) by that algorithm is always lower than some constant times f(n). To say that binary search has a running time of O(logn) is to say that there exists some constant c which you can multiply log(n) by that will always be larger than the running time of binary search. In other words where g(n) is the running time of your algorithm, we say that g(n) = O(f(n)) when g(n) &lt;= c*f(n) when n > k, where c and k are some constants.

Ground truth:
Big O notation is a way of describing the upper bound of an algorithm in terms of space or running time. The n is the number of elements in the the problem (i.e size of an array, number of nodes in a tree, etc.) We are interested in describing the running time as n gets  big.

There's no standard iPad browser width and height, as Apple's WebKit scales pages to fit the screen, allowing users to zoom in and out. Designing a 768x768 page is a good starting point, but prioritize finger-friendly navigation, using boxes with grouped data and related controls close together, to facilitate zooming and panning.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
That said, you can design your page to minimize the amount of zooming necessary. Your best bet is to make the width and height the same as the lower resolution of the iPad, since you don't know which way it's oriented; in other words, you would make your page 768x768, so that it will fit well on the iPad's screen whether it's oriented to be 1024x768 or 768x1024. To accomplish this, you'll likely want to divide your controls among a number of web pages. On the other hand, it's not the most worthwhile pursuit. Make boxes with relevant grouped data that can be easily double-tapped to focus on, and keep related controls close to each other. iPad users will most likely appreciate a page that facilitates the familiar zoom-and-pan navigation they're accustomed to more than they will a page that has fewer controls so that they don't have to.

The issue is likely due to a NetBeans generated form issue, possibly caused by an unusual form design or a bug in the form generator.

Extractive summary:
My suspicion is that the root cause is a combination of something a bit unusual (or incorrect) with your form design, and bugs in the NetBeans form generator that is not coping with your form.

Ground truth:
I'm surmising that the <code>OBD2nerForm</code> code you posted is a static initializer block and that it is all generated. Based on that and on the stack trace, it seems likely that generated code is tripping up because it has found some component of your form that doesn't have the type that it is expecting.

Go to Project __________________________________________ÃÂ» Clean __________________________________________ÃÂ» Clean projects selected below __________________________________________ÃÂ» select your project and click OK. That should work. It is also possible that you have a JAR file located somewhere in your project folders (I had copied the Admob JAR file into my src folder) and THEN added it as a Java Path Library. Another possible reason could be package name conflicts. In other ways this may be occurred if you accidentally or knowingly edit/ add any thing in the class path file manually .In certain cases we may add android.jar path manually to classpath file for generating java doc.On removing the that after javadoc generated code will works fine.Please check this too if any one still occurs.

Generated abstractive summary:
GET requests retrieve data, while POST requests submit data to be processed, typically creating or updating resources.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Finally, an important consideration when using <code>GET</code> for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a <code>GET</code> request.

POST and GET are HTTP request methods: GET retrieves data, is idempotent, and has limited data, while POST changes server state, carries more data, and is not idempotent.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
POST and GET are two HTTP request methods. GET is usually intended to retrieve some data, and is expected to be idempotent (repeating the query does not have any side-effects) and can only send limited amounts of parameter data to the server. GET requests are often cached by default by some browsers if you are not careful. POST is intended for changing the server state.

POST is used to send data to a server, while GET retrieves data from a server. POST has additional features, such as handling file attachments and preventing resubmission warnings.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With POST you can also do multipart mime encoding which means you can attach files as  well. Also if you are using post variables across navigation of pages, the user will get a warning asking if they want to resubmit the post parameter. Typically they look the same in an HTTP request, but you should just stick to POST if you need to "POST" something TO a server and "GET" if you need to GET something FROM a server as that's the way they were intended.

Generated abstractive summary:
The approach to finding missing numbers in a sequence of 1-100 depends on the value of k.

Extractive summary:
The same way for k=n-1, one can simply compare the only number in the bag with the rest.

Ground truth:
For different values of k, the approach will be different so there won't be a generic answer in terms of k. For example, for k=1 one can take advantage of the sum of natural numbers, but for k = n/2, one has to use some kind of bitset.

I'd use a set difference to find the missing numbers from 1-100.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I'd go for using a set difference for Qk. It's probably not the most efficient solution but it's one I would use in real life if I was faced with such a task in this case (known boundaries, low boundaries). If the set of number would be very large then I would consider a more efficient algorithm, of course, but until then the simple solution would be enough for me.

Generated abstractive summary:
The problem can be solved in O(N) time, but if you need to print the missing numbers, it can be done in O(k) time by using a data structure that supports both set operations and efficient iteration, such as a hash set and a doubly linked list.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
No matter how big k is, the problem can be solved in constant time because you can use a set and remove numbers from the set in at most 100 - k iterations of a loop. If we generalise the solution to the numbers from 1 to N, nothing changes except N is not a constant, so we are in O(N - k) = O(N) time. It seems to me that the interviewer was asking you how to <em>print out</em> the contents of the final set in O(k) time rather than O(N) time. However, if you change the way the set is implemented you can print out the numbers in k iterations. This is done by putting the numbers into an object to be stored in both a hash set and a doubly linked list. When you remove an object from the hash set, you also remove it from the list.

MVVM is an extension of MVC, decoupling the Model-View communication from the Controller, making controllers cleaner and more reusable.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
From what I can tell, the MVVM maps to the MV of MVC - meaning that in a traditional MVC pattern the V does not communicate directly with the M. In the second version of MVC, there is a direct link between M and V. MVVM appears to take all tasks related to M and V communication, and couple it to decouple it from the C. In effect, there's still the larger scope application workflow (or implementation of the use scenarios) that are not fully accounted for in MVVM. By removing these lower level aspects from the controllers, they are cleaner and makes it easier to modify the application's use scenario and business logic, also making controllers more reusable.

Generated abstractive summary:
MVC and MVVM are not mutually exclusive patterns. In ASP.Net, MVC is a server-side approach, while MVVM is used for client-side two-way data binding. In Silverlight and WPF, MVVM is a more comprehensive pattern that can replace MVC, but still requires controllers to handle logic and data flow. The ViewModel does not replace the need for controllers, which handle processing logic, data retrieval, and view logic. The basic guidelines for MVCVM are: 

- Views display data without knowing its source
- ViewModels hold data and commands, unaware of their source or display
- Models hold the actual data
- Controllers listen for events, provide logic, and control data flow
- Controllers provide commands to ViewModels for reusability.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
MVC/MVVM is not an either/or choice. The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development. For ASP.Net, MVVM is used to two-way bind data within views. MVC on the other hand is a way of separating concerns on the server-side. For Silverlight and WPF, the MVVM pattern is more encompassing and can appear to act as a replacement for MVC (or other patterns of organising software into separate responsibilities).

Find the product of numbers 1 to 50, then the product with two missing numbers removed. Use the difference between the two products and the sum of the known numbers to solve for the missing numbers using a quadratic equation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Let product, P1 = 1 x 2 x 3 x ............. 50 When you take out numbers one by one, multiply them so that you get the product P2. The product of the two mising terms, a x b = P1 - P2. You already know the sum, a + b = S1. From the above two equations, solve for a and b through a quadratic equation.

The problem with sum-based solutions is inefficient for large inputs. An alternative recursive algorithm in Haskell uses O(k + log(n)) space and O(kn log n) time.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The problem with solutions based on sums of numbers is they don't take into account the cost of storing and working with numbers with large exponents... in practice, for it to work for very large n, a big numbers library would be used. In Haskell syntax... BIGBLOCK Storage used: <code>O(k)</code> for list, <code>O(log(n))</code> for stack: <code>O(k + log(n))</code>This algorithm is more intuitive, has the same time complexity, and uses less space.

I'd take a different approach and ask for more details about the problem, suggesting a set-based solution that can handle unknown missing numbers and provide the result in O(log n) time.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Depending on the problem and the requirements surrounding it, the obvious set-based solution might be the right thing and the generate-a-list-and-pick-through-it-afterward approach might not. This certainly isn't the fastest approach for batch processing pre-generated bags of numbers because the whole thing runs <code>O((log 1 + log 2 + ... + log n) + (log n + log n-1 + ... + log k))</code>. But it does work for any value of <code>k</code> (even if it's not known ahead of time) and in the example above it was applied in a way that minimizes the most critical interval.

The Magical XCode Organizer isn't enough; using the command-line with a crash report, .app file, and .dSYM file can provide some symbols, but not for Foundation code.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The Magical XCode Organizer isn't that magical about symbolicating my app. I tried using the command-line, putting the crash report in the same folder as the .app file (that I submitted to the store) and the .dSYM file: This only provided symbols for my app and not the core foundation code, but it was better than the number dump that Organizer is giving me and was enough for me to find and fix the crash that my app had.

To run a Linux service as a different user, consider the following:

* Avoid using `sudo` in init.d scripts as it requires a tty.
* For Java applications, use Java Service Wrapper to set the user ID.
* Use `su --session-command=[cmd] [user]` as an alternative.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<li>Sudo in a init.d script is no good since it needs a tty ("sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo") <li>If you are daemonizing a java application, you might want to consider Java Service Wrapper (which provides a mechanism for setting the user id) <li>Another alternative could be <em>su --session-command=[cmd] [user]</em>

Ground truth:
As Sam Dutton answered, a new method for this very purpose has been introduced in ECMAScript 5th Edition. <code>Object.keys()</code> will do what you want and is supported in Firefox 4, Chrome 6, Safari 5 and IE 9. However, some of the implementations out there aren't fully compatible with Internet Explorer. It also doesn't account for the famous DontEnum bug in Internet Explorer where non-enumerable properties on the prototype chain cause locally declared properties with the same name to inherit their DontEnum attribute.

Reasons to use a `main()` function in Python: 

- Makes code more familiar for those used to other languages (C, Java).
- Keeps code clean, organized, and easier to read.
- Allows for importing code as a module without side effects.
- Enables testing and running code in an interactive shell.
- Keeps variables inside `main()` local, preventing unexpected behaviors.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Reasons to have that <code>if</code> statement calling <code>main()</code> (in no particular order): <li>Other languages (like C and Java) have a <code>main()</code> function that is called when the program is executed. Using this <code>if</code>, we can make Python behave like them, which feels more familiar for many people. <li>Code will be <em>cleaner</em>, easier to read, and better organized. (yeah, I know this is subjective) <li>It will be possible to <code>import</code> that python code as a module without nasty side-effects. <li>This means it will be possible to run tests against that code. <li>This means we can import that code into an interactive python shell and test/debug/run it. <li>Variables inside <code>def main</code> are <strong>local</strong>, while those outside it are <strong>global</strong>. But, you are <strong>not required</strong> to write a <code>main()</code> function and call it inside an <code>if</code> statement.

A generic array can be created in Java using a class that takes a class literal as a type parameter, and uses reflection to create an array of the specified type.

Extractive summary:
Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument.

Ground truth:
Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with <code>.class</code>. This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. Note that you won't be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can't be used for type variables. Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument. Calling the method <code>getComponentType</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the component type of the array represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called (e.g. Calling <code>String[].class.getComponentType()</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>, but its type is <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, not <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>, which is why you can't do something like the following.

EOF (End of File) indicates the end of a file, not the end of a line. It's typically triggered by a system-specific key combination (CTRL-D or CTRL-Z) and has a value of -1.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A newline (which is what happens when you press enter) isn't the end of a <em>file</em>, it's the end of a <em>line</em>, so a newline doesn't terminate this loop. The value of EOF is -1 because it has to be different from any return value from <code>getchar</code> that is an actual character. If you're typing at the terminal and you want to provoke an end-of-file, use CTRL-D (unix-style systems) or CTRL-Z (Windows).

EOF is defined as -1 in the standard library headers, and is used to indicate the end of a file. The `!=` operator checks if the result of `getchar()` is not equal to EOF, indicating the end of the file.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
EOF is -1 because that's how it's defined. They make it equal to -1 because it has to be something that can't be mistaken for an actual byte read by <code>getchar()</code>. The <code>!=</code> operator means "not equal". 0 stands for false, and anything else stands for true. Of course, you can always type more, so you need an explicit way to say "I'm done". On Windows systems, this is control-Z. On Unix systems, this is control-D. Reading until EOF means that you read everything, until the user says "I'm done", and then you can't read any more. Reading until '\n' means that you read a line of input. Reading until '\0' is a bad idea if you expect the user to type the input, because it is either hard or impossible to produce this byte with a keyboard at the command prompt :)

You cannot rely on client-side JavaScript to verify user credentials. Use a server-side program to handle login and redirect to the next page with an HTTP Location header.

Ground truth:
You <strong>cannot</strong> sanely depend on <em>client side</em> JavaScript to determine if user credentials are correct. The browser (and all code that executes that) is under the control of the user, not you, so it is not trustworthy. Note that you need to check the credentials are OK (usually by storing a token, which isn't the actual password, in a cookie) before outputting any private page.

<strong>px</strong>
<strong>Pixels</strong> - corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. <strong>in</strong>
<strong>Inches</strong> - based on the physical size of the screen. <strong>mm</strong>
&gt; <strong>Millimeters</strong> - based on the physical size of the screen. <strong>dp</strong> or <strong>dip</strong>
&gt; <strong>Density</strong>-independent Pixels - an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a <code>160</code>
dpi screen, so one dp is one pixel on a <code>160</code> dpi screen. <strong>sp</strong>
&gt; Scaleable Pixels <strong>OR</strong> scale-independent pixels - this is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended you
use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted
for both the screen density and the user's preference. From Understanding Density Independence In Android:

Short answer - de facto limit of 2000 characters
If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software, and any search engine. For specific use cases, longer URLs can be considered. Read on for all the details...
Longer answer - first, the standards... The executive summary is:

Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users. Search engines like URLs &lt; 2048 chars...
Be aware that the sitemaps protocol, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. While modern browsers will support longer URLs, search engines do not so the headline figure remains "under 2000 chars"

"Use strict" in JavaScript is a feature that enables a strict operating context for a program or function, catching common coding errors, preventing "unsafe" actions, and disabling poorly thought-out features. It can be applied to the entire file or a specific function, helping to prevent errors and improve code quality.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Update for ES6 modules
Inside native ECMAScript modules (with <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> statements) and ES6 classes, strict mode is always enabled and cannot be disabled. Original answer
This article about Javascript Strict Mode might interest you: John Resig - ECMAScript 5 Strict Mode, JSON, and More
To quote some interesting parts:

Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. And:

Strict mode helps out in a couple ways: It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions. It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively "unsafe" actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object). It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out. So, I suppose it's a bit like the <code>"use strict"</code> you can use in Perl <em>(hence the name?)</em>: it helps you make fewer errors, by detecting more things that could lead to breakages. Strict mode is now supported by all major browsers.

'git pull' merges fetched commits into your current branch automatically, whereas 'git fetch' stores new commits in your local repository without merging them, requiring 'git merge' afterwards.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>git pull</code> tries to automatically merge after fetching commits. <em>It is context sensitive</em>, so all pulled commits will be merged into your currently active branch. <code>git pull</code> automatically merges the commits <strong>without letting you review them first</strong>. <code>git fetch</code> gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in the current branch and <strong>stores them in your local repository</strong>. However, <strong>it does not merge them with your current branch</strong>. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on something that might break if you update your files.

`git fetch` updates your local copy of the remote repository, while `git pull` updates your own code repository by merging the changes from the remote repository into your local copy.

Extractive summary:
Normally <strong><code>git pull</code></strong> does this by doing a <strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.

Ground truth:
It is important to contrast the design philosophy of git with the philosophy of a more traditional source control tool like SVN.
Subversion was designed and built with a client/server model. Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the "server" don't need to be online at the same time. In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. Normally <strong><code>git pull</code></strong> does this by doing a <strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy. The take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least <strong>three copies</strong> of a project on your workstation.

`git fetch` updates the remote repository information locally, moving the `origin/master` pointer to the latest changes, while keeping your local branch unchanged. `git pull` does a `fetch` and then merges the changes into your local branch.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It cost me a little bit to understand what was the difference, but this is a simple explanation. <code>master</code> in your localhost is a branch. When you clone a repository you fetch the entire repository to you local host. This means that at that time you have an origin/master pointer to <code>HEAD</code> and master pointing to the same <code>HEAD</code>. But the origin/master pointer is still pointing to what it was when you cloned. If you do a <code>git fetch</code> it will just fetch all the changes in the remote repository (GitHub) and move the origin/master pointer to <code>HEAD</code>. If you do a <code>git pull</code>, it will do basically fetch (as explained previously) and merge any new changes to your master branch and move the pointer to <code>HEAD</code>.

Applying `"use strict"` to existing code can be hazardous as it may throw exceptions in places where loose JavaScript allows but strict JavaScript does not, potentially breaking functionality. It's recommended to use it in new, greenfield projects with comprehensive testing and a configured linter, and to avoid adding it to legacy or third-party code.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A word of caution, all you hard-charging programmers:  applying <code>"use strict"</code> to existing code can be hazardous! This thing is not some feel-good, happy-face sticker that you can slap on the code to make it 'better'. With the <code>"use strict"</code> pragma, the browser will suddenly THROW exceptions in random places that it never threw before just because at that spot you are doing something that default/loose JavaScript happily allows but strict JavaScript abhors! You may have strictness violations hiding in seldom used calls in your code that will only throw an exception when they do eventually get run - say, in the production environment that your paying customers use! If you are going to take the plunge, it is a good idea to apply <code>"use strict"</code> alongside comprehensive unit tests and a strictly configured JSHint build task that will give you some confidence that there is no dark corner of your module that will blow up horribly just because you've turned on Strict Mode. Or, hey, here's another option:  just don't add <code>"use strict"</code> to any of your legacy code, it's probably safer that way, honestly. <strong>DEFINITELY DO NOT</strong> add <code>"use strict"</code> to any modules you do not own or maintain, like third party modules. The best time to go strict is when your project is greenfield and you are starting from scratch.

Ground truth:
The JavaScript strict mode is a feature in ECMAScript 5. In this mode, errors are thrown up when certain coding practices that could end up being potential bugs are detected (which is the reasoning behind the strict mode). Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code. If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break. Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically. So in strict
mode, implied global variables are no longer created. In strict mode, attempting to change a
read-only property will throw an exception. So in
strict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error.

groups. <strong>Density-independent pixel (dp):</strong>

Use dp for layout dimensions (margin, padding) and sp for text sizes. Android automatically converts these units to pixels for different screen densities.

Ground truth:
<code>dp</code> is  <code>dip</code>. Use it for everything (margin, padding, etc.). Use <code>sp</code> for {text-size} only. To get the same size on different screen densities, Android translates these units into pixels at runtime, so there is no tricky math for you to do.

`git pull` is equivalent to `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. However, `git pull` automatically merges changes, potentially causing conflicts. Instead, use `git fetch` to retrieve changes and then manually merge or rebase as needed.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The short and easy answer is that <code>git pull</code> is simply <code>git fetch</code> followed by <code>git merge</code>. It is very important to note that <code>git pull</code> will <strong>automatically merge whether you like it or not</strong>. This could, of course, result in merge conflicts. Unless you really, really know what you are doing, I would advise against that. This is a potentially dangerous mode of operation. Do not use this option unless you have read git-rebase(1)
  carefully.

Android has four units for specifying dimensions in XML: 

- `px`: actual pixels on the screen
- `dp` (Density-independent Pixels): relative to a 160 dpi screen, scales with screen density
- `sp` (Scale-independent Pixels): like dp, but also scales with user's font size preference
- `in` and `mm`: based on the physical size of the screen.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
These are dimension values defined in XML. A dimension is specified
with a number followed by a unit of measure. The following units of measure are supported by Android:
<strong>dp</strong>
Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the
physical density of the screen. Using dp
units (instead of px units) is a simple solution to making the view
dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen
densities. In other words, it provides consistency for the real-world
sizes of your UI elements across different devices. <strong>sp</strong>
Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended that you use
this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for
both the screen density and the user's preference. This unit of
measure is not recommended because the actual representation can vary
across devices; each device may have a different number of pixels per
inch and may have more or fewer total pixels available on the screen. A dimension is a simple resource that is referenced using the value provided in the name attribute (not the name of the XML file).

So there will be one main Branch of the project and all the contributors must fork it to their own local repository and then work on this local branch to modify/Add modules then push back to the main branch. To avoid such issues and to work parallel with the original progress of the project there are Two ways:

In simple terms, if you were about to hop onto a plane without any Internet connection… before departing you could just do <code>git fetch origin &lt;branch&gt;</code>. It would fetch all the changes into your computer, but keep it separate from your local development/workspace. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody <em>else</em> has
been working on. You can consider
<code>git fetch</code> the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download
the remote content, but not update your local repository's working state,
leaving your current work intact. <em>Any</em> <code>git fetch</code> that you do will update the pointer in the <code>/.git/refs/remotes</code> directory. It <strong>won't</strong> update anything in the <code>/.git/refs/heads</code> directory. <em>Any</em> <code>git pull</code> will first do the <code>git fetch</code> and update items in the <code>/.git/refs/remotes</code> directory.

The "use strict" directive in JavaScript is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 5 that enables strict mode, which eliminates language deficits, improves error checking, and enhances security. It can be used at the beginning of a script or function and has the following effects:

- Eliminates the `with` statement
- Requires variable declaration
- Changes the behavior of `this` in functions
- Introduces stricter error handling for `eval()`
- Modifies the behavior of the `

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would like to offer a somewhat more founded answer complementing the other answers. The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important): You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode. In strict mode all variables have to be declared: if you assign a value to an identifier that has not been declared as variable, function, function parameter, catch-clause parameter or property of the global <code>Object</code>, then you will get a <code>ReferenceError</code>. In strict mode the keyword <code>this</code> has the value <code>undefined</code> in functions that were invoked as functions (not as methods). In strict mode, when passing code to <code>eval()</code>, you cannot declare or define variables or functions in the scope of the caller (as you can do it in normal mode).

`git pull` fetches changes from the remote repository and immediately merges them into the local repository, while `git fetch` only retrieves changes from the remote repository without merging them into the local repository.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I have struggled with this as well. Reading all these answers finally painted a picture in my head and I decided to try to get this down looking at the state of the 2 repositories and 1 sandbox and actions performed over time while watching the version of them. So here is what I came up with. This helped me understand why a fetch is pretty important.

Browser URL length limits vary, with Internet Explorer having a 2,083 character limit, Firefox and Safari having an unlimited limit but instability at around 65,000 characters, and Opera having no limit.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is really no universal maximum URL length. The max length is determined only by what the client browser chooses to support, which varies widely. The 2,083 limit is only present in Internet Explorer (all versions up to 7.0). The max length in Firefox and Safari seems to be unlimited, although instability occurs with URLs reaching around 65,000 characters. Opera seems to have no max URL length whatsoever, and doesn't suffer instability at extremely long lengths.

Generated abstractive summary:
There are three types of units in Android:

1. **px (Pixels)**: Used for defining exact screen positions and sizes, but not recommended for layout dimensions. 
2. **dp (Density-independent pixels)**: A virtual pixel unit for expressing layout dimensions or positions in a density-independent way. It's equivalent to 1 physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen and is automatically scaled based on the screen's actual density.
3. **sp (Scaled pixels)**: Used for font sizes, allowing the font to change with the device's font size setting.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure
proper display of your UI on screens with different densities. sp
Use sp for font sizes. Developers may get such a requirement for some specific screens, for that, developers can use dp instead of sp. In all other cases, sp is recommended.

"Use strict" mode in JavaScript helps with faster debugging by throwing exceptions for silent and strange behavior. It prevents global variable declaration, eliminates the use of the "with" statement, and throws an error for duplicate properties in object literals.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<em>My two cents:</em>
One of the goals of strict mode is to allow for faster debugging of issues. It helps the developers by throwing exception when certain wrong things occur that can cause silent &amp; strange behaviour of your webpage. The moment we use <code> use strict</code>, the code will throw out errors which helps developer to fix it in advance. Few important things which I have learned after using <code> use strict</code> :
<em><strong>Prevents Global Variable Declaration:</strong></em> When we implement <code>use strict</code> the code would throw error. They're also deprecated and removed from future JavaScript versions. <em><strong>Prevents Duplicates :</strong></em> When we have duplicate property, it throws an exception Duplicate data property in object literal not
allowed in strict mode

`git pull` is equivalent to `git fetch + git merge`, whereas `git fetch` retrieves data but doesn't update local code, requiring a manual `git merge` to apply the changes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If you run <code>git pull</code>, you do not need to merge the data to local. If you run <code>git fetch</code>, it means you must run <code>git merge</code> for getting the latest code to your local machine. So in the Git Gui, when you do fetch, you have to merge the data. Fetch itself won't make the code changes at your local. You will see the changed code.

Decimal is the recommended column type for storing product prices, as it is a fixed-precision data type that can represent all values exactly, unlike Float which is an approximate data type.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Decimal is the one I would use

The basic difference between
  Decimal/Numeric and Float : Float is
  Approximate-number data type, which
  means that not all values in the data
  type range can be represented exactly. Decimal/Numeric is Fixed-Precision
  data type, which means that all the
  values in the data type reane can be
  represented exactly with precision and
  scale. For the Decimal or Numeric
  data types, SQL Server considers each
  specific combination of precision and
  scale as a different data type.
  DECIMAL(4,2) and DECIMAL(6,4) are
  different data types.

Ground truth:
<strong>Git Fetch</strong>
You download changes to your local branch from origin through fetch. <strong>Git Merge</strong>
You can apply changes downloaded through fetch using the merge command. <strong>Git Pull</strong>
Fetch and merge run together often enough that a command that combines the two, pull, was created.

Use dp for font sizes to ensure consistent design across different devices, as using sp can lead to inconsistent and unappealing font sizes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is a lot of talk about using "sp" for font sizes, and while I appreciate the point, I don't think that it is the right thing to do from a design point of view. While the idea of "sp" fonts has a good heart, it is a poor idea. Stick with dp for everything.

The main differences are:

- **sp**: Avoid using, not recommended.
- **dp** (or **dip**): Density-independent pixels, used for multiple screen support.
- **dpi**: Dots per inch, measures screen resolution.

Android has different screen densities:

- ldpi (~120 dpi)
- mdpi (~160 dpi)
- hdpi (~240 dpi)
- xhdpi (~320 dpi)
- xxhdpi (~480 dpi)
- xxxhdpi (~640 dpi)

Use the conversion formula: `pixel = dp * (density / 160)` to design layouts for different densities.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
We should avoid to use <strong>sp</strong>. We should use <strong>dp</strong> to support multiple screens. Android supports different screen resolutions We as software engineers should use this conversion formula:

pixel = dp * (density / 160) Using this 1.5 and 3 pixels knowledge, a software engineer can design layouts for different densities.

URI producers should use names that
conform to the DNS syntax, even when
use of DNS is not immediately
apparent, and should limit these names
to no more than 255 characters in

Rogue, Hack, and Nethack are the best open source games to learn from, being influential and having a significant impact on the hack-and-slash genre.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If part of the reason for open-source code is for code to be reused and recycled as it evolves, then I think influence and legacy would be two large factors in this decision. On this basis, I would probably vote Rogue / Hack / Nethack. It was one of the seminal influences behind the hack-and-slash dungeon-crawling genre, living on today in thriving communities that still play these old ASCII games, as well as having a significant influence on some of the most popular graphical games of all time, such as Diablo and Diablo 2.

I converted the file to Unix format with below command: I hope that we should take care whenever we edit files across platforms we should take care for the file formats as well.

DPI measures pixel density, while others are units for screen size and font size:

- dpi (dots per inch): measures pixel density
- px (pixels): measures screen pixels
- pt (points): about 1/72 of an inch
- in (inches) and mm (millimeters): physical screen size
- sp (scale-independent pixels): based on user's font size preference
- dip (density-independent pixels): varies based on screen density, equivalent to dp
- dp (density-independent pixels): used for layout, except font size

Conversion formula: px = dp * (dpi / 160)

Density buckets:

- ldpi (120 dpi): 60x60 px
- mdpi (160 dpi): 80x80 px
- hdpi (240 dpi): 120x120 px
- xhdpi (320 dpi): 160x160 px
- xxhdpi (480 dpi): 240x240 px
- xxxhdpi (640 dpi): 320x320 px

Extractive summary:

The HTTP protocol does not have a fixed limit on URL length, but servers should be able to handle URIs of any length and return a 414 status code if the length exceeds their capacity.

Ground truth:
The HTTP 1.1 specification says:

URIs in HTTP can be represented in
  absolute form or relative to some
  known base URI The two
  forms are differentiated by the fact
  that absolute URIs always begin
  with a scheme name followed by a
  colon. The HTTP protocol does not place
  any a priori limit on the length of
  a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
  the URI of any resource they    serve,
  and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
  unbounded length if they    provide
  GET-based forms that could generate
  such URIs.*</strong> A server    SHOULD return
  414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
  URI is longer    than the server can
  handle (see section 10.4.15). Note: Servers ought to be cautious about depending on URI
  lengths
        above 255 bytes, because some older client or proxy
        implementations might not properly support these lengths. As mentioned by @Brian, the HTTP clients (e.g. browsers) may have their own limits, and HTTP servers will have different limits.

- `dp` (density-independent pixels): device density standard, used for layout bounds.
- `sp` (scale-independent pixels): device text size, can break layout if used carelessly.
- `px` (pixels): not recommended for Android development.
 
Use `sp` for text size, `dp` for layout bounds, and consider UX when using `sp` and `dp`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Most Android developers miss this while developing apps, so I am adding these points. sp for text size, dp for layout bounds - standard. But <strong>sp for text size will break the layout if used carelessly</strong> in most of the devices. No standard app use sp for whole text</strong>
Use sp and dp for text size considering UX. Put sp for text where necessary, but make sure it won't break the layout when the user changes his settings. But now xxxhdpi phones are common so we have to include xxxhdpi assets at least for icons in the sidebar, toolbar, and bottom bar.

Android uses screen size, density, and resolution categories. 

*   Screen size categories: small, medium, large, extra large, double-extra, and triple-extra.
*   Screen density categories: low, medium, high, and extra high.
*   Resolution: total number of pixels on the screen.

Key units:

*   **dp** (Density Independent Pixel): varies based on screen density, 1 dp = 1 pixel in 160 dpi screen. Use dp for all layouts except font sizes.
*   **dip**: same as dp, used in earlier Android versions, now replaced by dp.
*   **sp** (Scale Independent Pixel): scaled based on user's font size preference, use sp for font sizes.
*   **px** (pixel): standard pixel, maps to the screen pixel.
*   **in** (inches): physical screen size.
*   **mm** (millimeters): physical screen size.
*   **pt** (points): 1/72 of an inch, physical screen size.

To sanity check a date in Java, use `SimpleDateFormat.parse` to catch invalid day/month combinations, but note that it's liberal and may not catch invalid characters or 2/3/4-digit years.

Alternatively, consider using the Joda Time library for better strictness and flexibility.

To design UI for different screen sizes in Android, follow these guidelines:

1. Use a minimum size in dp for each screen type.
2. Prepare graphics and bitmap images for each density (ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi).
3. Use a 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between densities.
4. Design in pixel-based tools like Photoshop, and use the following mapping:
   - 1dp = 1px at 160 dpi (mdpi)
   - Use this to define UI size in pixels for each density.

Additionally, consider using the SDP (scalable dp) library or ConstraintLayout for a more flexible UI design.

Ground truth:
I've come across a good article about designing Android apps UI for different screen resolutions, and I'd like to leave it here just for somebody searching in this area. It remained unclear to me how to design layouts capable to handle different screen sizes. Designing flexible UI in Android is not an easy thing (at the best). Many designers have problems designing Android app UI in photoshop or another pixel
based graphic design tools because of the density-independent unit, dp. Google also doesn’t give
a clear Android UI design guide for them, though they give a basic
formula for dp and pixel translation. This size unit scales with the screen size (this also mentioned in an answer here, about <code>SDP</code> library) Google has finally understood the usefulness of the iOS Storeboard UI concept, and here goes <code>ConstraintLayout</code> for Android world: Build a Responsive UI with ConstraintLayout

`git fetch` downloads the latest remote version but doesn't merge, while `git pull` downloads and merges the latest remote version into the local repository.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Git obtains the branch of the latest version from the remote to the local using two commands: git fetch: Git is going to get the latest version from remote to local,  but it do not automatically merge. git pull: Git is going to get the latest version from the remote and merge into the local. The command above is the equivalent to <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code>. In practice, <code>git fetch</code> maybe more secure because before the merge we can see the changes and decide whether to merge.

`git fetch` updates your local copy of the remote repository, while `git pull` fetches the changes and merges them into your local repository.

Extractive summary:
Normally, <code>git pull</code> does this by doing a ‘git fetch’ first to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then it merges the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.

Ground truth:
Actually Git maintains a copy of your own code and 
the remote repository. The command <code>git fetch</code> makes your local copy up to date by getting data from remote repository. The command <code>git pull</code> brings the changes in the remote repository to where you keep your own code.

It successfully decrypts in both cases. The source code that demonstrates AES interop between Javascript or VBScript and .NET is available. I extended the basic example given here to produce test apps in 3 languages: C#, Javascript and VBScript. You can easily verify that the ciphertext is the same for each of these test programs.

`git pull` is equivalent to `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. `git fetch` retrieves data from a remote repository but doesn't change local branches, requiring a separate merge to incorporate changes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
git pull == ( git fetch + git merge)
git fetch does not changes to local branches. If you already have a local repository with a remote set up for the desired project, you can grab all branches and tags for the existing remote using git fetch . Fetch does not make any changes to local branches, so you will need to merge a remote branch with a paired local branch to incorporate newly fetch changes.

The differences between px, dp, and sp:

- **dp (density-independent pixels):** scales based on screen resolution (160 dpi baseline)
- **sp (scale-independent pixels):** scales based on screen dpi and user's font size preference
- **px (pixels):** actual screen dots

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
1) <strong><code>dp: (density independent pixels)</code></strong> The number of pixels represented in one unit of dp will increase as the screen resolution increases (when you have more dots/pixels per inch). Conversely on devices with lower resolution, the number of pixels represented in on unit of dp will decrease. This is the equation: <code>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</code>

2) <strong><code>sp: (scale independent pixels)</code></strong>
This unit scales according to the screen dpi (similar to dp) as well as the user’s font size preference. 3) <strong><code>px: (pixels)</code></strong> 
Actual pixels or dots on the screen.

- **SP (Scale-independent pixels):** Used for font sizes, scaled by user's font preference.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Screen size</strong> in Android is grouped into categories <code>ldpi</code>, <code>mdpi</code>, <code>hdpi</code>, <code>xhdpi</code>, <code>xxhdpi</code> and <code>xxxhdpi</code>. Screen density</strong> is the amount of pixels within an area (like inch) of the screen. Generally it is measured in dots-per-inch (<code>dpi</code>). <strong><code>DP/DIP(Density pixels / Density independent pixels):</code></strong> <code>dp</code> is highly recommended to use in place of <code>px</code>. <strong><code>SP(Scale independent pixels):</code></strong> Fonts should use <code>sp</code>. Android Documentation says:

when specifying dimensions, always use either <code>dp</code> or <code>sp</code> units. A <code>dp</code> is
  a density-independent pixel that corresponds to the physical size of a
  pixel at 160 <code>dpi</code>. An <code>sp</code> is the same base unit, but is scaled by the
  user's preferred text size (it’s a scale-independent pixel), so you
  should use this measurement unit when defining text size

Ground truth:
The calculated column solution is probably the best one. But if you can't alter the data table's schema to add that, you can loop through the table and populate a new collection that will serve as the data source.

`git pull` and `git fetch` differ in their purpose: `git fetch` updates your local information about the remote branch, while `git pull` updates your local branch by merging or rebasing the remote changes.

Extractive summary:
In order to bring the changes to your local branch you have to merge/rebase the changes from the remote branch.

Ground truth:
One must keep in mind the nature of git. You have remotes and your local branches ( not necessarily the same ) . Usually when you checkout a remote a local copy is created that tracks the remote. In order to bring the changes to your local branch you have to merge/rebase the changes from the remote branch. git pull does exactly these two steps ( i.e. --rebase to rebase instead of merge ) Thus it really depends on the nature of your work environment and experience what to use.

Pixel density refers to the number of pixels per inch on a screen. To accommodate different screen densities, device-independent pixels (dp) and scalable pixels (sp) are used. These units scale uniformly on any screen, ensuring consistent UI element display across various densities.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Pixel density
Screen pixel density and resolution vary depending on the platform. Device-independent pixels and scalable pixels are units that provide a flexible way to accommodate a design across platforms. The number of pixels that fit into an inch is referred to as pixel density. High-density screens have more pixels per inch than low-density ones. <strong>Density independence</strong> refers to the uniform display of UI elements on screens with different densities. <em>Density-independent pixels</em>, written as <em>dp</em> (pronounced “<em>dips</em>”), are flexible units that scale to have uniform dimensions on any screen. Material UIs use density-independent pixels to display elements consistently on screens with different densities.

To recover SVN history during refactoring, use TortoiseSVN's "Repair Move" feature by marking both the old and new file, then right-clicking and selecting "Repair Move". Alternatively, resurrect the old file from an old revision, merge the new file's history, delete the new file, and then move the old file to the new name.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The SVN way to do this is actually to have SVN rename the file (<code>svn move</code> or using TortoiseSVN's "Rename"). However, if you absolutely <em>must</em> have some external tool to perform the rename operation, you can <strong><em>use TortoiseSVN to repair the move operation</em></strong>. The following will tell SVN that the new file is actually the renamed old one: If you already lost the history on a file where you miss it badly, you could resurrect the old file (you do this by <code>svn copy</code>ing an old revision's version into its old place), merge the new file's history into it, then delete the new file, and <code>svn move</code> the old file to the new file's name.

The code needs to update the table view with index paths that correspond to the newly added data in the datasource, and use `dispatch_after` to perform the insertion after a delay.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The code is close, but the table view needs to be updated with index paths in exact correspondence with what's added to the datasource. You want a weakSelf to avoid cycle where the block owner retains the block and the block (by using the block owner "self") retains the owner. There's no need for the weakSelf pattern here since the view controller is not retaining a copy of the dispatched block.

Pixels (px) are the smallest elements on a screen, but thinking in pixels is not useful for designing for Android. Density Independent Pixels (dp or dip) allow designers to create assets that appear as expected on different resolutions and devices. Scale Independent Pixels (sp) is the preferred unit for font size, as it adjusts to the user's font size settings for better accessibility.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as <strong>pixels (px)</strong>. A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important. <strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device. Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone. <strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size. With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.

Pixels (px), Density-independent Pixels (dp or dip), and Scale-independent Pixels (sp) are units used in Android development:

- Pixels (px): Absolute pixels on the screen.
- Density-independent Pixels (dp): Relative to a 160 dpi screen, scales with screen density.
- Scale-independent Pixels (sp): Scales with both screen density and user's font size preference.

Use dp for layout dimensions and sp for font sizes for compatibility across devices.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Pixels(px)</strong> – corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. <strong>Density-independent Pixels (dp or dip)</strong> – an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. <strong>Scale-independent Pixels(sp)</strong> – this is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user’s font size preference. Always use dp and sp only. It will make UI compatible for Android devices with different densities.

Generated abstractive summary:
WCF has three messaging patterns: synchronous request-response, asynchronous send (one-way service), and asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service). For returning a success to the client when data is persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are suitable.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There are three messaging patterns mentioned here: All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate. Option 2
Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not. Option 3
Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. As Whisk mentioned, Juval Lowy has an article covering a lot this detail (and more!) One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown.

Avoid using the @ symbol in C# unless necessary, such as when dealing with external libraries, code generation, or verbatim string literals.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Indeed, it is almost always worth avoiding this. The main <strong>valid</strong> time it might be useful is when dealing with an external library (from another language) that has a class / etc that happens to be a C# keyword, but I'll admit I've <strong>never</strong> had this problem in reality. The @ symbol's other use (verbatim string literals) is @"much more useful".

`dp` is a physical length unit equivalent to 1/160 inch, making it a convenient measurement for screen sizes, but its accuracy can be affected by the actual screen dpi.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I want to provide an easy way to understand <code>dp</code>. In fact, I think <code>dp</code> is the easiest one to understand. <code>dp</code> is just a physical length unit. It's just convenient for us to write <code>50dp</code>, <code>60dp</code> rather than <code>50/160 inch</code> or <code>60/160 inch</code>, because one <code>dp</code> is just <code>1/160 inch</code> whatever the screen size or resolution is. The only problem is that, the android dpi of some screens are not accurate. So the computation result of <code>dp</code> is fuzzy.

"use strict" in JavaScript makes the language more robust by enforcing coding best practices, but JavaScript remains fragile due to its lack of typed variables and methods.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
"use strict"; is the ECMA effort to make JavaScript a little bit more robust. It brings in JS an attempt to make it at least a little "strict" (other languages implement strict rules since the 90s). It actually "forces" JavaScript developers to follow some sort of coding best practices. Still, JavaScript is very fragile.

"Use strict" mode in JavaScript, introduced in ECMAScript 5, enables strict syntax checking, preventing:

1. Assigning to undeclared variables
2. Overwriting key JavaScript system libraries
3. Using unsafe or error-prone language features

It can be applied at the top of a file or inside individual functions, promoting better coding practices and is backwards-compatible with browsers that don't support it.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
JavaScript “strict” mode was introduced in ECMAScript 5. Writing <code>"use strict";</code> at the very top of your JS file turns on strict
syntax checking. It does the following tasks for us: shows an error if you try to assign to an undeclared variable stops you from overwriting key JS system libraries forbids some unsafe or error-prone language features It is always a better practice to include <code>use strict</code> in your code.

The issue was caused by DOS line endings, which can be fixed with the `dos2unix` command.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I had the same error message when trying to run a Python script -- this was not @Warpspace's intended use case (see other comments), but this was among the top hits to my search, so maybe somebody will find it useful. In my case it was the DOS line endings (<code>\r\n</code> instead of <code>\n</code>) that the shebang line (<code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code>) would trip over. A simple <code>dos2unix myfile.py</code> fixed it.

Instead of requesting all GHC extensions, specify the used ones with the LANGUAGE pragma. Parallel comprehensions can be simulated using the zip function, and many extensions are safe to use if supported by two or more compilers.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Instead of requesting <em>all</em> GHC extensions, specify which ones are used using the <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma mechanism: Parallel iteration over the same list is allowed. The problem is that parallel comprehensions are not defined in the Haskell 98 standard. Extensions themselves are not bad -- much of the standard library uses extensions, of one sort or another. Any extension listed in the HaskellExtensions wiki page with support from two or more compilers is probably safe to use.

Using recursion in a web spider is not recommended due to the risk of infinite loops and the web's complex structure, which is more like a web than a tree. An iterative approach with a queue is a better solution.

Ground truth:
Definitely not, you're going to run into problems very quickly because of the actual nature of the world wide web. The second you hit a site with a main navigation section, where each page links to each other page, you've entered an infinite loop. You're better off finding all links on the current page and adding those links (if they don't already exist) to a central queue, and proceeding iteratively through the queue processing every link as you come to it (remember to keep track of links that you've finished processing, or you'll add them to the end of the queue again)

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>/var/lib/flatpak/</code> &amp; <code>~/.local/share/flatpak/</code> are the system &amp; user install location for installed runtimes (e.g. <code>org.gnome.

If you built with <code>flatpak-builder</code> they would be in a folder called <code>.flatpak-builder</code> &amp; the <code>build</code> folder (what ever you called it). Delete <code>~/gitg-build-folder/build</code> &amp; <code>~/gitg-build-folder/.flatpak-builder</code> to remove any build files produced during building gitg. If you don't need to build anything in the future you could delete <code>org.gnome. You might also have the <code>*.Debug</code> SDK extension installed which would take a lot of space.

To improve Python decompression performance, consider using `numpy.savez_compressed` for a 2.3x speedup over PIL-based code, or `pickle` with `lz4` for a 2.4x gain, which is 30% slower than uncompressed pickling.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Loading is 2.3x faster than your PIL-based code. It only costs 5% of the slow loading time. Fast decompression
According to the zstd benchmarks, when optimizing for decompression lz4 is a good choice. Just plugging this into pickle gives another 2.4x gain and is only 30% slower than uncompressed pickling. The load time was measured inside Python (3.7.3), using the minimum wall-clock time over 20 runs on my desktop. Most time is spent inside of the Linux kernel, doing <code>page_fault</code> and stuff associated with (re-)allocating memory, probably including disk I/O.

Python-blosc is a fast and easy-to-use library for decompressing data. It is often faster to compress data for IO operations, especially for small arrays.

The `decompress_pre` function can be used to decompress arrays that have been pre-allocated. The library also provides a `bloscp

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can use Python-blosc
It is very fast and for small arrays (&lt;2GB) also quite easy to use. On easily compressable data like your example, it is often faster to compress the data for IO operations. In the decompression step the array allocation is the most costly part. If your images are of similar shape you can avoid repeated memory allocation. It does handle f-contiguous, c-contiguous and non-contiguous arrays and arrays &gt;2GB.

Hash table resizing takes O(n) time, but with infrequent resizing, the amortized cost of insertion is constant.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
For some uses of hash tables, it's impossible to create them of the "right" size in advance, because it is not known how many elements will need to be held simultaneously during the lifetime of the table. If you want to keep fast access, you need to resize the table from time to time as the number of element grows. These resizing operations can be made seldom enough that the amortized cost of insertion is still constant (by following a geometric progression for the size of the table, for instance doubling the size each time it is resized). In practice, this is not a problem unless you are building hard real-time applications.

To get microseconds in PHP, use: 

- `\DateTime::createFromFormat('U.u', microtime(true))`
- `\DateTime::createFromFormat('0.u00 U', microtime())`
- `gettimeofday()` with `sprintf('%d.%06d', $time['sec'], $time['usec'])`

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
But there is a loss of precision because of PHP float rounding. It's not truly microseconds. This is probably the best compromise of the <code>createFromFormat()</code> options, and provides full precision.

"Use strict" in JavaScript creates an alternative interpretation of code, fixing some design mistakes while maintaining backward compatibility. It affects how the "this" keyword behaves, resolving to undefined in global functions, rather than the global object.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
JavaScript was designed and implemented hastily because of the browser wars and bad management. Strict mode aims to amend some of these mistakes. But fixing these mistakes without creating alternative interpretation breaks backward compatibility. So, <code>"use strict"</code> directive creates that alternative interpretation of the code while communicating it to the programmer. In strict mode <code>this</code> in a global function resolves to undefined, which is what we expect. Some mistakes can not be fixed even in strict mode because syntax should be valid for older browsers since they ignore <code>"strict mode"</code> directive.

Using a cast-or-null function is considered "evil" because it's obscure, hard to read, and may not be optimized by the JIT compiler, whereas a simple instance check followed by a class cast is more readable and likely to be optimized.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Now, I was told that using this castOrNull function in that way is an evil thing do to. It is an obscure and tricky way of doing something very simple. Obscure and tricky code is hard to read, hard to maintain, a potential source of errors (when someone doesn't understand it) and <em>therefore</em> evil. Unnecessary use of reflection is evil. Of course, "evil" is just another way of saying that you REALLY shouldn't do this. IMO, the "simple way" is better from both the readability and performance perspectives.

When working with Postgres intervals, different formats can result from the same value due to calculations and date differences. The `justify_hours` function is available to standardize the format. A reverse function `unjustify_hours` can be created to convert hours to interval format.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When an interval is <strong>a difference between two timestamps</strong> <strong>Calculations on intervals</strong> are executed on date part and time part separately, so they may lead to strange formats. However they did not think that the reverse operation would be needful. In this answer I proposed a function to convert a date part of an interval to hours. Per the documentation:

According to the SQL standard all fields of an interval value must
  have the same sign, so a leading negative sign applies to all fields;
  for example the negative sign in the interval literal '-1 2:03:04'
  applies to both the days and hour/minute/second parts. PostgreSQL
  allows the fields to have different signs, and traditionally treats
  each field in the textual representation as independently signed, so
  that the hour/minute/second part is considered positive in this
  example. and

Internally interval values are stored as months, days, and seconds.

<strong>Yes</strong>, It's considered part of the best practices while working with javascript to include <em>Strict mode</em>. And that's where strict mode helps out. <em>Using a variable without declaring it</em> will throw an error in strict mode.

Ground truth:
Modern game programming is tremendously complex as a whole Modern games are usually too complicated and large for one person to have a detailed and in-depth knowledge of the entire process. Recently, for my Computer Graphics course in College we used the open source OGRE 3D engine. Develop a medium sized game using it and you will get a good taste of many of the above mentioned game programming specialties. I've often heard and read articles surrounding the industry talking about the long hours, the crunch time, the unpaid overtime and the relatively lower pay when compared to other types of programming. Game programming is one area where Math is used extensively in several phases of development. Most of the articles I have read involving the industry suggest that someone with no professional experience looking to get break into gaming should put together a portfolio of small games you have written demonstrating your abilities.

To perform a full-text search over multiple tables and columns, consider using SQL Server's CONTAINSTABLE function. However, without knowing the user's intent, the best approach is to OR the terms and take the highest ranking hits. This can be done by joining the tables and using CONTAINSTABLE, then UNIONing the results and aggregating by rank. This approach is less than ideal and may not always produce the desired results, suggesting a redesign of the GUI to separate input into name and address, or enforcing a syntax rule to divine the user's intent.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This is more of a syntax problem. Without knowing the user's intent, the best you can hope for is to OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits. etc...
I guess I would redesign the GUI to separate the input into Name and Address, at a minimum. If that is not possible, enforce a syntax rule to the effect "First words will be considered a name until a comma appears, any words after that will be considered addresses"
<strong> EDIT:</strong>
Your best bet is still OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits. This is less than ideal, here's what you get for the example (in your case, you would have wanted John Doe from Hamburg to show up first): But that is the best you can do without parsing the input before submitting it to SQL to make a "best guess" at what the user wants.

Use a SimpleDateFormat to parse and reformat the date, then compare the original and reformatted values to check if they match.

Extractive summary:
An alternative strict solution using the standard library is to perform the following:
1) Create a strict SimpleDateFormat using your pattern
2) Attempt to parse the user entered value using the format object
3) If successful, reformat the Date resulting from (2) using the same date format (from (1))
4) Compare the reformatted date against the original, user-entered value.

Ground truth:
An alternative strict solution using the standard library is to perform the following:
1) Create a strict SimpleDateFormat using your pattern
2) Attempt to parse the user entered value using the format object
3) If successful, reformat the Date resulting from (2) using the same date format (from (1))
4) Compare the reformatted date against the original, user-entered value. If they're equal then the value entered strictly matches your pattern. This way, you don't need to create complex regular expressions - in my case I needed to support all of SimpleDateFormat's pattern syntax, rather than be limited to certain types like just days, months and years.

To find the MysqlDumpSlow command on Windows, you need to select "Developer Components > Scripts, examples" during the MySQL installation, which is not installed by default. The command is then located in the "scripts" directory, specifically "mysqldumpslow.pl", which requires Perl to be installed and running.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
So, you are not alone, and it doesn't seem to be a problem with your install <em>(I've tried 5.1.x, but as you highlighted, it should be the same for 5.0.x)</em>
Looking at the "<code>mysqldumpslow</code>" I have under Linux, it appears it is a Perl script ; and Perl is not often installed on a Windows machine. Well, after a bit more testing, when installing MySQL, it seems <strong>you have to select "Developpers Components &gt; Scripts, examples"</strong>, which is not installed by default (at least on windows) -- no need to reinstall everything : you can "modify" the installation, to add this option. In this directory, there are some scripts ; one of them is <strong>mysqldumpslow.pl</strong> ; which is what you are looking for ;-)
Now, you "just" have to get Perl installed and running on your machine (sorry, I've never installed Perl on windows ; but you can find some informations here) Hope this helps better than what I posted before !

Generated abstractive summary:
Rails' async jobs don't run in rake tasks because they are cleared from memory when the process ends, unlike inline jobs which run immediately. This is a limitation of Rails' in-process queuing system and concurrent-ruby, and is not a problem with sidekiq or resque.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With the advent of concurrent-ruby, rake tasks aren't set up to handle this. If the process crashes or the machine is reset,
  then all outstanding jobs are lost with the default async back-end. So, if you're doing any sort of data changes, rake tasks won't be open long enough to run a job, which is why they run <code>:inline</code> just fine, but not <code>:async</code>. It's why it works fine with <code>:sidekiq</code> or <code>:resque</code>, because those applications keep the job information in memory and do not release when the rake task is over. locally, there's not much you can do other than run tasks as <code>:inline</code> if you're local until rake (as a task runner) understands how to stay open while asynchronous tasks have been launched (or not). As a development only feature, this isn't really high priority, but, if you're bashing your head on the table not understanding why <code>:async</code> by default tasks that run jobs won't actually run, that's why.

The issue with using "this" as the controller name in Angular's controller as syntax is not because "this" is a reserved word, but because "this" is used in Angular's template expressions to refer to the current scope.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The problem is certainly <strong>not</strong> that <code>this</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript. There's a simple way to test that JavaScript reserved words are not the issue here. Yes.
<code>this</code> is, however, reserved in the context of angular's own template expressions. And sure enough, change the template expression to <code>{{log(this.this)}}</code> and it will log the controller instance just fine.

PHP's `date()` function does not support milliseconds or microseconds directly. To display the ISO 8601 format date & time with milliseconds or microseconds, you can use the following code:

- For milliseconds: `list($sec, $usec) = explode('.', microtime(true)); echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s.', $sec) . $usec;`
- For microseconds: `list($usec, $sec) = explode(' ', microtime()); echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $sec) . substr($usec, 1);`

Ground truth:
An explanation of how to display the ISO 8601 format date &amp; time in PHP with <strong>milli</strong>seconds and <strong>micro</strong>seconds...
<em><strong>milli</strong>seconds or 'ms' have 4 digits after the decimal point e.g. 0.1234. Seconds fractions/names explanation here</em>
PHP's <code>date()</code> function does not behave entirely as expected with milliseconds or microseconds as it will only except an integer, as explained in the php date docs under format character 'u'. These also eliminate race conditions and correctly formats the seconds. PHP Date with <strong>milli</strong>seconds Output = <code>2016-07-12 16:27:08.5675</code>
PHP Date with <strong>micro</strong>seconds
Working Equivalent of <code>date('Y-m-d H:i:s').".$microseconds";</code> or <code>date('Y-m-d H:i:s.u')</code> if the date function behaved as expected with microseconds/<code>microtime()</code>/'u'

1. Subject: The method causing the error, specifically the overloaded method "split".
2. Verb: The action causing the error, which is "cannot be applied".
3. Object: The specific code causing the error, which is calling "split()" with no arguments.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
So the whole first part is the subject, aka a description of what is concerned by the error. This subject is indeed the <code>overloaded method value split</code> followed by a reminder of the different valid signatures for this mehod. Don't search for what you did wrong here, it's only a description of the object concerned by the error ! The verb gives you the problem, it "cannot be applied". The object gives you the why : you called it with no arguments, and this doesn't match any of the valid signatures which you were reminded of in the "Subject" part.

The recommended approach is to isolate concerns into separate Rails apps, but this can lead to database scaling issues. To mitigate this, use a master-slave database setup and caching. Alternatively, consider Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with separate databases and inter-app communication through APIs for better isolation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I believe the benefits of isolating your concerns into separate apps outweigh the costs. Having separate apps will make each app smaller and easier to maintain. Better isolation, separate db's and inter-app communication through web APIs (SOA) and you don't have to worry about that. At any rate, having separate apps sets you up for SOA but you don't have to jump beyond a single db to start.

Instead of using `TTURLAction`, a category can be used to automatically add a table item's `userInfo` property as a URL parameter. This can be used in the `initWithNavigatorURL:query:` method to retrieve the passed object.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The big problem with directly using <code>TTURLAction</code> is that you can't really use them with <code>TTTableViewItem</code>. The only way to really do it is override <code>-didSelectObject:atIndexPath:</code> and build your custom <code>TTURLAction</code> with your desired object in the <code>query</code> dictionary. But this breaks the nice separation of Model and View Controller, and gets complicated once you have multiple objects to pass. Instead of this, I've been using a small category which automatically takes the <code>userInfo</code> property of the table item (which I set to whatever I need), and automatically adds it as a URL parameter.

Then your second location is a common location defined by a prefix string <code>/users/</code>, the modifier <code>^~</code> you use means skip the regular expression check and use the current longest matching prefix, here is the <code>/users/</code> one, so with your config you will always get a 403 return. If the longest matching prefix location has the “^~” modifier then regular expressions are not checked.

To fix the PySide import error on Mac OS X El Capitan, install PySide 1.2.2 using pip: `pip install -U PySide==1.2.2`. Then, use `install_name_tool` to re-link relative libraries to absolute paths.

Ground truth:
I got it to work. After that, when trying to import PySide libraries, I got errors complaining about 

unsafe use of relative rpath

To fix those I followed this advise
In a nutshell: I checked the libraries for relative links like this:
<code>otool -L /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/PySide/QtCore.so</code> This got PySide 1.2.2 working on El Capitan for me.

The error in the implementation of a map on a custom type is due to the incorrect use of the `filter` function, which expects a list of elements, not a list of lists. The correct implementation should pattern match on the `List` type to apply the function to each element.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
First, to explain the error message: you can't use <code>filter</code> in your definition, since Similarly <code>filter</code> returns a Prelude list of something, but the signature requires that it return a <code>List</code> of something. Note that the program you wrote is perfectly valid, it just conflicts with the signature you gave it: Of course, if you have your own <code>filterList</code> for <code>List</code>s it will also typecheck What this function does is delete null elements from a List of Lists, like <code>Prelude.filter (not .

To add a filename column to a Pentaho data integration CSV input, use the Text File Input step, which provides more options, including adding a field for the filename. However, if you need the CSV Input's performance advantages, you can get the filename with the Get Variables step or by passing it as a named parameter.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
but you probably will want to use the <strong>Text File Input</strong> step to parse your CSV file, rather than the <strong>CSV Input</strong> which is a subset of options from the Text File Input with some performance advantages for delimited files. With <strong>Text File Input</strong> there are a lot more options available to you for reading the file. Using this step would solve your problem because in the <em>Additional output fields</em> tab you can specify a field in the stream to put your filename, extension, file path, etc. The advantages you gain when using the <strong>CSV Input</strong> are: If you need those advantages then you'll have to get at your file name another way, such as passing it as a named parameter and adding it to the stream with the Get Variables step.

In a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), key concepts include:

- **Activation functions**: Non-linear functions that take input and output a value based on a threshold, mimicking how neurons work.
- **Activation Gradients**: The slope of the activation function, showing areas where the network focuses.
- **Weights**: Values that influence the activation function, affecting the output.
- **Weight Gradients**: The slope of the cost-weight curve, indicating how the loss changes with weight values.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
An activation function is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some "threshold" (this is specific for each different activation function). This comes from how neurons work, where they take some electrical input and will only activate if they reach some threshold. A gradient is essentially the slope of the activation function. This article may clear up some confusion on weights and activation functions. The "max activation" and "min activation" values make sense for a ReLu: the minimum value will be zero and the max is whatever the maximum value is.

Ground truth:
I would bundle this all into the same app because you won't be duplicating the classes (models, plugins, etc.) across all the apps.

For the issue between the sales site and the users site having to have different roots that can be solved, as mentioned earlier, by subdomain_fu.

Using Enum Singletons has a significant drawback: they can't be easily mocked for testing, limiting flexibility and testability.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
All Java singleton patterns (both this and the standard with private constructor and static accessor) have this bad property that if you to test them (or test anything that even remotely depends on them) can use this and only this object. For example if you want to test <code>PrintingService</code> class that depends on <code>PrintingSingleton</code> you will not be able to replace this printing singleton with a mock because it is bound statically. Personally, I would just avoid using singletons that way but rather introduce dependency injection, via Guice, Spring or Pico Container. That way you ensure existence of only one object, while not limiting yourself to not being able to mock the object out for example for tests.

A custom `JsonSerializer` is causing a recursive loop, leading to a `StackOverflowError`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The point of a <code>JsonSerializer</code> is to serialize the fields of an Object, not the object itself. However, you are passing the object you've already told <code>Gson</code> to serialize. which I hope you can see is going into recursive loop. But your <code>JsonSerializer</code> will send it back to the <code>JsonSerializationContext</code> and the loop goes on.

The error "No such file or directory" may be due to a script error or file format issue. Try adding "sh" before the script name for debug output or check if the file is in the correct format.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I got the same error for a simple bash script that wouldn't have 32/64-bit issues. This is possibly because the script you are trying to run has an error in it. This ubuntu forum post indicates that with normal script files you can add <code>sh</code> in front and you might get some debug output from it. In my case the actual problem was that the file that I was trying to execute was in Windows format rather than Linux.

In well-designed Java code, instanceof and casts are rarely needed, and using a castOrNull method can make code look unnatural. It's generally better to remove casts by refactoring code to avoid them.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In most well written/designed Java code the use of instanceof and casts never happens. With the addition of generics many cases of casts (and thus instanceof) are not needed. The biggest problem when changing from one language to another is adopting the conventions of the new language. Generally speaking casts are "evil" in Java because they are usually not needed. Your method is more "evil" because it is not written in the way most people would expect Java to be written.

You can't directly call the class that created you, as it's a tightly coupled design. Consider alternative solutions: get data from the child, pass data to the child, call the method in the parent and pass the result, or use inheritance.

I think what you call a parent-child relationship is just a composition (the 'parent' holds an instance of an unrelated in the hierarchy class, the 'child').

The Person class can have a Collection of roles defined and the Role class can have a Collection of people defined. This page explains how to do the mapping so that PeopleRole is a composite element.

The ternary operator (?:) is syntactic sugar that improves readability, allowing for more complex decision trees to be chained together in a single line of code, making it more concise and easier to understand.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The real difference is that it selects a final result. Really, just syntactic sugar that improves readability. It can be argued that it is just a matter of style, thus subjective. But, the legibility becomes even greater when you have a more complex decision tree, such as: You can chain together many decisions in one place instead of writing a bunch of nested if-then-else clauses: This is somewhat following a code pattern called method chaining.

Creating a Calendar object is slow and complex due to date/time complexities, making Date objects a better choice for getting a date in string format.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Creating a Calendar object is a relatively slow and complex action, it has to compensate for all the oddities that are inherent to dates and times such as timezones, daylight savings etc. Your best bet is to use the Date object as your first example, see here for a comparison on performance metrics of Date, Calendar and SimpleDateFormat. Whilst the difference between Java Date and JodaTime is probably negligible in performance terms, JodaTime is generally agreed to be a better way of handling dates and times. For your purpose, importing JodaTime just for a timestamp may well be overkill though.

Firebird 1.0.3 uses a random port for events, which doesn't work well with firewalls. To fix this, use the `RemoteAuxPort` setting in `firebird.conf` to specify a fixed port, which was added in Firebird 1.5.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
By default Firebird uses a random port for events. This doesn't work well with firewalls, so Firebird also offers an option to use a fixed port, using the <code>RemoteAuxPort</code> setting in <code>firebird.conf</code>. This is where the problem becomes evident: the client tries to connect to that port (6023) on the firewall (as it “sees” the firewall as a server). Since the port is completely random, there are certainly no forwarding rules for that port on the firewall, so connection is denied.

2. Alternatively, reuse a single `Statement` instance and close resources in a `finally` block or use a `try-catch-resource` block.
 
Additionally, it's recommended to:

- Use `PreparedStatement` to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Ensure that foreign keys in reference tables are not auto-incrementing.

In a Convolutional Neural Network, the key terms are:

- **Activations**: The output of a layer
- **Activation Gradients**: The gradient of the loss with respect to the input of a layer (used for debugging)
- **Weights**: Filters used in convolutional layers
- **Weight Gradients**: The gradient of the loss with respect to the weights of a layer

Ground truth:
<strong>Confusion point 1:</strong> Looking at the code it seems like in the case of the input layer the "Activations" visualisation are the coloured image for the first figure. The second figure does not really make any sense because the code is trying to display some gradient values but it's not clear where they come from. Activations: It is the output of the layer This name is confusing but it is basically the gradient of the loss with respect to the input of the current layer l.

Modeling a domain well is key to mapping classes in NHibernate. Consider using the concept of roles, where a single object (e.g., Person) captures identity, and separate objects (e.g., Student, Tutor) capture additional information related to specific roles. This allows for flexibility and easy introduction of new roles without modifying existing objects.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It seems to me that this is more a question around how to model a domain well, rather than an NHibernate mapping issue. Once you've sorted out your domain modelling, I think you'll find the NHibernate mapping falls out relatively easily. One place to look to get your head around the idea of modeling Roles is to look for "Color Modeling" - Jeff de Luca has some resources, though the idea originated with Peter Coad
The basic idea is to separate the identity of a participant from the role they play in an activity. This structure gives you great flexibility - one person (Joe Bloggs) may just be a student, another person (Jane Doe) may just be a tutor, and a third (Chuck Norris) may be both. Also, introducing another role (Lecturer, Marker, Administrator) becomes easier because the additions don't require changes to existing objects.

The C# compiler cannot use polymorphism due to a generic base class, which leads to a circular scenario. One solution is to move the type parameter from the class to the factory method, restricting its usage to the base class type. This allows for instantiation of derived classes while maintaining base class references.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
you're using Derived1 in two different ways according to the base class. This is not wrong (if that's what you really want), but it's unusual for most programming scenarios; you normally choose one or the other. However the benefit of your logic is: not only do you have an implicit instance of Derived1 through inheritance (same for any other derived class), but the base class can <em>also</em> handle other external instances of that same derived type through the type parameter <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> One Solution...
One possible (and strong solution) is to move the Type parameter from the class to the factory Create method and restrict its usage to the Base class type like so: Your factory method is restricted to create only instances of derived types.

No certain answer, but it's likely a Magento team coding convention to use an underscore prefix for local variables to indicate they're loosely coupled with an object.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
No certain answer here, but I believe it's just an internal magento team coding convention. I'm sure you're aware of the underscore prefix's history in programming in general. It's not too much of a stretch to think that 

local variables used in a view script that are loosely coupled with an object are similar to private or protected variables  

In other words, the underscore serves as a warning that 

hey, the contents of this variable doesn't just belong to this view, it's owned by something else  

Part of the problem is there's no "official" recommendations from Zend, or anyone else, what sort of naming conventions should be used in phtml files.

To schedule actions at various timings, use `viztask.schedule()` and `yield viztask.waitTime()`, as shown in the example: `viztask.schedule(myfunc())` and `mydata = yield viztask.waitTime(cuetime)`. This allows for accurate timing due to frame syncing.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
busfault is correct about your use of the FOR loop. To test it using <code>yield</code>, you need to <code>schedule</code> the called function. You'll find that the timing mismatch is usually related to your frame rate ( 60 Hz ~ 16.7ms) Following edit by OP:
.. an easy way to test if the timing differences are due to the frame syncing is to turn off Vertical sync (V-Sync) for your graphics card and re-run it - I suspect you'll get much better timings, however you might get frame tearing on your display  - then it's your call as to what is more important to you, image quality or timing accuracy. I notice you've gone back to using time.time() - this will be LESS accurate than using the return object from waitTime as per my demo  (ie <code>mydata = yield viztask.waitTime( cuetime)</code> ... )

Implementing AutoCloseable is beneficial as it allows for try-with-resource syntax and is semantically correct if your class has a close operation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There's no problem in having a class implement <code>AutoClosable</code> even if it's super class doesn't. If your class has some semantic of <code>close</code>ing it, you should probably have it implement <code>AutoClosable</code>. It costs almost nothing to do so, if at all, and it allows you to use Java 7's neat syntactic sugaring of the try-with-resource syntax.

There's no direct way to ignore PreferredSize in GridBagLayout. Options include using gridwidth, weightx constraints, or a Relative Layout to assign space proportionally or relatively, effectively ignoring the preferred size.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is no such concept as "units" in GridBagLayout. A GBL uses cells. Each component will originally be sized at its preferred size. If you want truly relative sizes then you can use the Relative Layout. It allows you to specify the size of components relative to the total space available, so the preferred size can be ignored.

Extractive summary:
I'd use that.

Ground truth:
This will allow <code>1000 / 4</code> numbers or <code>250</code>. Another bug: You were never filling the first element of <code>array</code>. Another [minor] bug is that you're relying on <code>$t2</code> to have a zero value without explicitly setting it. Here's the cleaned up code. I added a limit check on the user's count Printing the array is similar to the input of the array. I've reworked the previous example code. I removed the hardwired limit value of 250 in favor of using a new label: <code>arrend</code> [so, have a look]
Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array.

To reference other classes in C++, compile and link all sources. A sample Makefile is provided to demonstrate this.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is still an error in your post - a missing <code>;</code> after the <code>DriverClass</code>
declaration. The rest is correct. You should compile and link all the sources. However, note that it's generally recommended to compile the sources into objects separately in order to compile only the sources changed after the last compilation. I've used the GNU compiler.

Adding "item-frequency" to the cts:sum-aggregate function solved the issue by returning the same value as the standard sum function.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
After reading the answer from wst I confirmed that the type of my index was decimal and then played around with the options a bit and found that adding "item-frequency" as an option to the sum-aggregate function solved my issue. I don't completely understand the nuances between "item-frequency" and "fragment-frequency" in relation to the sum-aggregate function but the following xQuery works like I expect it to causing both sums to return the same value.

Primitive types (strings, numbers, etc.) are immutable, so changes made in the child component don't affect the original value in the parent component.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In Javascript primitive types (strings, numbers, etc.) are <em>immutable</em>. Objects (complex types like arrays, objects, functions, etc.) are mutable and passed by reference. Whilst, when you pass an object (like array), parent and child both going to work with the reference to the same object. Changes to one are reflected in another.

When using a LEFT OUTER JOIN in SQL Server, placing a condition in the `ON` clause preserves the driving table's rows with NULLs in the slave table, while placing it in the `WHERE` clause filters out non-matched rows, returning only the matched ones.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Left Outer Join - ON clause vs WHERE clause</strong>
For a left outer join, for the same condition, there is a big difference depending on where it is placed - the join clause or the where clause. As expected, all rows from driving table with NULLs for no match from slave table. <strong>Condition in ON clause</strong> Here, the columns of the driving table is preserved but the join clause NULLs the non-matched row(s) in the slave table. <strong>Condition in WHERE clause</strong> This gives only the matched row(s) because the where clause filters out all rows that do not match the conditions which are applied after the join clause on a row by row basis.

To customize Dispform.aspx in SharePoint List: 

1. Check the DataFields tag in the Data View Web Part to ensure the new field is included.
2. Use the internal field name (e.g. Comments) instead of the display name (e.g. Notes).
3. Add the new field to the correct location in the XSLT template.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your approach is okey, couple of things to check:
1) Each Data View Web Part has the DataFields tag, it looks like this: Make sure your new field is displayed in this list. 2) Also there is difference between internal field name and field name. In the example above <strong>Comments</strong> is internal name but name is <strong>Notes</strong>. So to display Notes field correctly you should use: 3) Make sure you are trying to output this value in the right place of XSLT template. The easiest way to find the place is to look for existing fields and just add the new one along these.

The problem is that there's no such class as Class (and as a side note, this nonexistent class also doesn't respond to <code>classNamed:</code>). It's not quite clear whether you want to <em>create</em> a class or get a <em>reference</em> to a class. If the latter, you want the function <code>NSClassFromString()</code>.

To fix the "Unknown key(s)" ArgumentError, use `@names = Name.find(params[:name_ids].keys)` to get the keys from the `name_ids` hash. Additionally, update the `update_attributes!` line to use `params[:name_ids][name.id.to_s].reject { |k,v| v.blank? }` to correctly update the attributes for each name.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Likely you need to get just the keys from the name_ids hash. A separate problem is your reference to params[:name], which is nil. EDIT (brief-ish explanation):
What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids]. An ActiveRecord 'find' method can take an array of ids, but not a hash of values. There was no value ':name' in params, so calling 'reject' on it cause the 'no method' error -- there is no 'reject' method on the nil object. What you wanted was to update the attributes for the 'name' that corresponded to the particular name in the loop. meant that params would contain a hash called 'name_ids', with keys corresponding to name.id, that themselves would contain hashes of attributes that ActiveRecord could use in the update_attributes method.

In Python 2.5, you can't override `reversed(...)`, so you must modify code that uses `reversed` to use an alternative.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>__reversed__</code> isn't supported in 2.5, so your only option if you really need to customize the reversed order of your collection, is to modify the places that you call <code>reversed</code> to use something else. But I'm curious: if you are subclassing <code>dict</code>, then the order of items is arbitrary anyway, so what does reversed mean in this case?

Install AnkhSVN or VisualSVN to track file renames and maintain SVN history during refactoring.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You could install the (free) visual studio add-in AnkhSVN. This will track your file-renames and you won't lose the history in subversion. If you rename files without using the subversion client (using windows explorer or visual studio solution explorer instead of TortoiseSVN or AnkhSVN), then subversion won't recognise the rename operation (only a delete and an add operation). BTW: using AnkhSVN gives you some other advantages, such as the displaying the subversion status of files directly in the solution explorer. Alternatively there's also VisualSVN, which is comparable to AnkhSVN, but is commercial.

Ground truth:
You seem to be obsessed with getting rid of a temporary variable and one line of code, while to me the bigger question is <em>why you need so many downcasts in your code</em>? In OO this is almost always a symptom of suboptimal design. And I would prefer solving the root cause instead of treating the symptom.

A three-table structure (articles, tags, articles_tags) is recommended for a search/tag system. For searches, consider using "like" with wildcards, regex, or full-text search. Don't worry about optimizing joins, as MySQL can handle them efficiently.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Q1 - you're better off with three separate tables for articles, tags, and a link table relating articles and tags. You could also do it with two tables for articles and an articles_tags table. Either two or three tables makes it easy to find which articles have a given tag and which tags are assigned to a given article. Q2 - title and description searches could be done using "like" with percents or with regex or full text search. Q3 - don't worry about joining the tags tables with the others. Q4 - It depends what you want to get out of the results. Q5 - again, you'd have to use "like" syntax and maybe some creative regex on the PHP side before the query is handed off to the database.

The `DataOutputStream.available()` method does not guarantee all data is available, so use `writeInt()` to send the data length first, then create a byte array with that size on the receiver side.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The contract of <code>in.available()</code> does not guarantee anything. It is never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream. Your code basically rely on / assume that all data sent, will be available immediately and reported accordingly by <code>in.available()</code>. To make sure you get all data, you could, on the sender side, start by sending an integer, telling how many bytes will be sent: You could for instance use <code>str.getBytes("UTF-8")</code> and <code>new String(bytes, "UTF-8")</code> to be sure the receiver interprets the bytes the way the sender intended.

Check out this blog on implementing autocomplete using GWT:

But I would recommend you first start with something very simple on your own to grasp how the implementation is done. I'd start with a Trie, maybe even stored completely on the client, then progress to optimizing with server queries if you think they're necessary.

Customization can be achieved by using text-form configuration files (e.g. XML), allowing the main application to be generic and customizable through parsing of these files.

Extractive summary:
I would be tempted to arrange things so that customization is in text-form (possibly XML, but I guess that's not the only option), and the main application is generic, and gets the customer specific features by parsing those configuration files.

Ground truth:
I would be tempted to arrange things so that customization is in text-form (possibly XML, but I guess that's not the only option), and the main application is generic, and gets the customer specific features by parsing those configuration files. You could then have a repository for each customer, containing configuration files (and possibly resources, like logos, and/or custom scripts), and a repository for the main application. For a given customer version, your build system then automatically gathers the application and the customer's repository, and builds the custom version. It makes things a little bit more complex on the application side at first, because you need to add parsing functionality, but it makes management of various customer versions a lot simpler, and somewhat less error prone.

Generated abstractive summary:
To scale cache state across multiple servers, consider using consistent hashing, which maps data keys to specific servers, minimizing data replication and re-distribution when servers are added or removed.

Extractive summary:
The "consistent" part of consistent hashing, refers to how your hashing function handles new servers being added to or removed from the cluster: some re-distribution of keys between servers is required, but the function is designed to minimize the amount of such disruption.

Ground truth:
If you ultimately decide to move the cache outside your main webserver process, then you could also take a look at consistent hashing. This would be a alternative to a replicated cache. The problem with replicated caches, is they scale inversely proportional to the number of nodes participating in the cache. So each caching server is responsible for a fraction of the overall keys, the client can determine which server will contain the sought data without any lookup, and data and eviction messages do not need to be replicated between caching servers. Consistent hashing is used at large scale.

To add additional parameters to a "select" control in Codeigniter's Form Helper, you need to extend the native Form Helper by creating a new file named `MY_form_helper.php` in the `application/helpers` directory and overriding the `form_dropdown` function. You can add or modify the function to include additional attributes like IDs.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You would need to extend CI's Form Helper and modify
  form_dropdown to accept other attributes like ID's

you will have to extend the helper . to extend the native Form Helper you'll create a file named
  <strong>application/helpers/MY_form_helper.php</strong>, and add or override
  functions:

if you want to override <code>function form_dropdown</code>
simply write the function the way you want in <code>MY_form_helper.php</code>
here is the base function as you can see , only the option's  <strong>value attribute</strong> is set by the function , you can edit this code and 
do the thing you want ,
try it , if you could not do it , tell me i ll help you , but first give it a try :)

Yes, it is perfectly legal to declare a pure virtual function twice in a class hierarchy.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Yes, it is perfectly legal. In most situations the declaration on f() in B doesn't change the meaning of the program in any way, but there's nothing wrong with a little redundancy. Recall that the "= 0" means only that the class may not be instantiated directly; that all pure virtual function must be overridden before an object can be instantiated. You can even provide a definition for a pure virtual function, which can be called on an instance of a subclass. By explicitly declaring B::f(), you leave open the option of giving a definition for B::f().

The program is not actually leaking memory, but Valgrind incorrectly reports it due to the way GTK uses its own memory allocator and static memory allocation at startup. Setting environment variables `G_SLICE=always-malloc` and `G_DEBUG=gc-friendly` can help, but Valgrind may still report leaks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You're not doing anything wrong. GTK widgets use reference counting, but in your programme all the references are taken care of, so you're not (manually) leaking anything. Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, Valgrind will still report that your app leaks memory. The reason for this is that GTK (and its underlying libraries) allocate some "static" memory at start-up that doesn't get freed until the programme quits. This isn't really a problem, because typically the programme ends as soon as <code>gtk_main()</code> returns, and then the OS frees any remaining resources, so you're not <em>really</em> leaking anything. Valgrind thinks you are though, and for this reason it would be nice to have a <code>gtk_deinit()</code> function, but sadly there isn't one. The best you can do instead is to teach Valgrind to ignore these things, via a suppressions file.

Note: The function only works if there is at least one HighGUI window
  created and the window is active. If there are several HighGUI
  windows, any of them can be active. So you can either open a window that does show something other than the current image of the webcam or use another <code>sleep</code> command to wait for a specified time.

`.then()` can only be used on functions that return a Promise. It can be used on `commentsService.getComments($routeParams.id)` because it returns a Promise.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>.then()</code> can't be used on any function. Only a function that returns some form of a Promise. I would review the MDN docs on Promises, Promise.prototype.then, and Promises in Angular using $q.
In your case, only <code>commentsService.getComments($routeParams.id)</code> returns a Promise, so <code>.then()</code> can be called on it. <code>commentsService.getComments($routeParams.id).then()</code> also returns a Promise that resolves after the function in the <code>.then()</code> block runs, therefore you can simply add a <code>return</code> to chain the Promise created.

Closes this resource, relinquishing any underlying resources. This method is invoked automatically on objects managed by the try-with-resources statement.

Generated abstractive summary:
The code has a pointer reset issue due to not flushing or refreshing the MAXCNT register. Using a standard C function for reading from stdin and printing to stdout shows that the buffer address is incremented and reset correctly. The issue can be fixed by simply resetting the pointer to the buffer address or using a variable to index the buffer instead of a pointer.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your method of resetting the pointer is correct, although there are some easier ways to achieve it. I assume that your error must be somehow related setting the MAXCNT register or reading new data from the receive register. I tested your code by replacing the Raspberry Pi specific register usage with standard C functions for reading from stdin and printing to <code>stdout</code>. It's easy to test and see that the part of the code that involves receiving an individual char digit, storing it in a string buffer, converting that buffer to an int, and reusing the buffer, are all correct. <strong>19432</strong>
  MAXCNT: 38863
  nR address before reset: <strong>0x10779f065</strong>
  nR address after reset: <strong>0x10779f060</strong> 

I mentioned earlier that there are some easier ways for you to reset the pointer. You can actually do it without using <code>nRreset</code>; since the base address for <code>newResBuffer</code> never changes, you can simply reset it with <code>nR = newResBuffer</code>. An even easier way to do it would be not to use a moving pointer at all and simply use the variable <code>j</code> You can also use <code>atoi()</code> or <code>strtol()</code> instead of <code>sscanf()</code> to convert the string buffer to an <code>int</code> (or <code>long</code>).

To disconnect signals and do monkey-patching in Django code, it's recommended to do so in the `ready()` method of your `AppConfig` class, along with connecting signals.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would say yes, but I think there is no clear right or wrong here, with regards to connecting signals, the Django docs state the following:

Strictly speaking, signal handling and registration code can live
  anywhere you like, although it’s recommended to avoid the
  application’s root module and its models module to minimize
  side-effects of importing code. In practice, signal handlers are usually defined in a signals
  submodule of the application they relate to. My opinion is that if the recommended way to connect signals is to do it in the <code>ready()</code> method of your <code>AppConfig</code>, disconnecting signals and related monkeypatching should also be done in this method. Write some sort of unit tests or integration tests to ensure that my code does what I want it to do, even when updating dependencies etc.

To find vulnerabilities in code, use a combination of:

1. High compiler warning levels and options (e.g., `-pedantic` for GCC)
2. Static source code analyzers
3. Dynamic analyzers
4. Tables of possible control and data flows
5. Careful examination of function calls, assignments, and instructions
6. Reading documentation and the C standard

Additionally, be aware of potential distractions and common pitfalls.

Extractive summary:
There are some traps to distract you from the real errors, too.

Ground truth:
How can I find vulnerabilities in this code? With experience, a good set of compiler options, a static source code analyzer, a dynamic analyzer, ... anything you know how to use. If you don't know how to use such, I'm afraid that you have to learn. You can find the worst problems by raising the warning level of your compiler to the max and even give option like <code>-pedantic</code> for GCC. The same applies to the analyzers of which the static kind is quite simple to use. Then think about what will happen further down the control flow. Do this for every function call, every assignment, and every instruction. Yes, a lot of people know this.

The code crashes due to a "live-lock" caused by using `zmq::recv_flags::dontwait` on a REP socket, which requires a previous successful `recv()` before sending. The issue can be resolved by using a blocking-form of `recv()` or `poll()` to check for incoming messages before sending.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Welcome to the domain of the Zen-of-Zero
<strong>Suspect #1:</strong> the code jumps straight into an unresolveable live-lock due to a move into ill-directed state of the distributed-Finite-State-Automaton: While I since ever advocate for preferring non-blocking .<code>recv()</code>-s, the code above simply commits suicide right by using this step:
<strong><code>socket.recv( request, zmq::recv_flags::dontwait ); // socket being == ZMQ_REP</code></strong>
kills all chances for any other future life but the very error  <em><code>The zmq_send() operation cannot be performed on this socket at the moment due to the socket not being in the appropriate state.</code></em>
as
going into the <strong><code>.send()</code></strong>-able state is possible <strong>if and only if</strong> a previous <code>.recv()</code>-ed has delivered a real message. The Best Next Step :
Review the code and may either use a blocking-form of the <code>.recv()</code> before going to <code>.send()</code> or, better, use a { blocking | non-blocking }-form of <code>.poll( { 0 | timeout }, ZMQ_POLLIN )</code> before entering into an attempt to <code>.recv()</code> and keep doing other things, if there is nothing to receive yet ( so as to avoid the self suicidal throwing the dFSA into an uresolvable collision, flooding your <code>stdout/stderr</code> with a second-spaced flow of <code>printf(" ERROR: The Problem 1 :
On the contrary to the suicidal <code>::dontwait</code> flag in the Problem 2 root cause, the Problem 2 root cause is, that a blocking-form of the first <code>.recv()</code> here moves all the worker-threads into an undeterministically long, possibly infinite, waiting-state, as the <code>.recv()</code>-blocks proceeding to any further step until a real message arrives ( which it does not seem from the MCVE, that it ever will ) and so your pool-of-threads remains in a pool-wide blocked-waiting-state and nothing will ever happen until any message arrived. Update on how the <code>REQ/REP</code> works :
The <strong><code>REQ/REP</code></strong> The code is not a reproducible MCVE. Persevere, ZeroMQ took me some time of scratching my own head, yet the years after I took a due care to learn the Zen-of-Zero are still a rewarding eternal walk in the Gardens of Paradise. No localhost serial-code IDE will ever be able to "debug" a distributed-system (unless a distributed-inspector infrastructure is inplace, a due architecture for a distributed-system monitor/tracer/debugger is another layer of distributed messaging/signaling layer atop of the debugged distributed messaging/signaling system - so do not expect it from a trivial localhost serial-code IDE.

To access GNOME keyrings from Ruby, install the `keyring` or `gir_ffi-gnome_keyring` gem. The `keyring` gem allows basic keyring operations, while `gir_ffi-gnome_keyring` provides more control and flexibility.

Ground truth:
Unfortunately the <code>keyring</code> gem does not allow you to use anything other than the default keyring. To use other keyrings, or if you just want to cut out the middle-man: If the keyring is unlocked (which it probably will be, because by default it uses your login keyring which is automatically unlocked when you log in) then reads and writes will work without any issues. If the keyring is locked, then you will be prompted to supply a password to unlock the keyring, before any reading or writing can happen. Then you probably need to install the gnome-keyring headers (<code>apt install libgnome-keyring-dev</code>)

The issue with `BeginCollectionItem` returning null is due to a mismatched collection name. Change `Html.BeginCollectionItem()` to `Html.BeginCollectionItem("mylist")` to match the collection property name.

Additionally, remove the hidden inputs before the `BeginCollectionItem` to allow the `DefaultModelBinder` to correctly bind the edited values.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your collection property is named <code>mylist</code> therefore you must pass that name to the <code>BeginCollectionItem</code> method However, you have other issues with your code. The <code>DefaultModelBinder</code> binds the first name/value pair matching a model property and ignores any subsequent name/value pairs with the same name. Because you have a hidden input for each property before the textbox, only the initial values you sent to the view will be bound when you submit, not the edited values. You including 2 inputs and a button, but that will not bind to your model and will not correctly add items to your collection (your add button needs to use ajax to call a server method that returns another partial view and append it to the DOM)

When sending large data to SQL Server, a timeout of 0 may cause the control to appear to disappear, but the data is actually being processed. Consider increasing the timeout to a reasonable value (e.g., 200 seconds) or adjusting batch size based on environment factors.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When sending a large amount of data to Sql Server to be saved this is most likely what you are observing, it appears that nothing is happening when in fact this data has to be sent to the server and then processed and<code>500 MB</code> could take a while for that to happen. after 200 seconds due to a time out. If this is not desirable then you need to figure out good balance between time and batch size based on the amount of time it takes per XX MB. The only way you can measure that is by testing with various batch sizes as it is dependent on your environment (network capacity, sql server load, client load among other things).

There are several ways to reset edited cells in a JTable to their original values, including creating a new TableModel, tracking changes with a HashMap, or using a Table Cell Listener to save original values.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can just create a new TableModel using this data and reset the model of the table. However the problem is that you need two copies of the data.

one which doesn't require creating two identical data arrays. So you could keep a <code>HashMap</code> where the key is the row/column and the data is the original value. So on a "Cancel" you would just iterate through the <code>HashMap</code> and restore the data for each key found in the Map. You can use the Table Cell Listener to listen for changes to the TableModel.

Auto Completion is an open problem with many strategies, including:

3. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Reduces space complexity, but has its own limitations.
4. Other Tree options: Radix

Ground truth:
based on my knowledge, I list a short highlights of some of well known Auto Completion strategies and their corresponding data structures. also I tried to summarizing their major <em><strong>pros</strong></em> and <em><strong>cons</strong></em> related to <strong>Auto Completion</strong> problem. <strong>Brute Force</strong> : <strong>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</strong> :
Trie has space problem so other data structures main goal is reducing the space complexity. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is one of the options. linear search is the worst case option so most strategies improved their search time by using either sorting( <em>O(nlog(n)</em> ) and then using Binary search( <em>O(log(n)</em>) ) or using a hashtable ( <em>O(1)</em>, fast but has more space complexity). Prioritizig Offers</strong> :
Markov Chain can be used to prioritize next states. it stores connection probabilities which leads to more accurate results. <strong>Long short term memory (LSTM )</strong> :
there are so many useful Machine Learning and Deep Learning strategies. <strong>Transformers</strong> :
The last but not least, I recommend Transformer models. currently they are game changers.

You can use a one-way service call with a duplex service and callback contract to notify the client of a failure, or return a value indicating success or failure.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There's 2 ways you could do this - return a value from your wcf call indicating success or failure, or assume success and use a callback to tell the client if there's a problem. My preference would be to use a one-way service call with a duplex service and use a callback contract for the service to notify the client of a failure. I think you get a nicer, more asynchronous architecture if you follow the second path, but for simple applications just returning success or failure may be easier.

Use a filename based on the creation date's binary representation, allowing for unique and automatic incrementing filenames.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Instead of using a running counter, consider using <code>datetime of creation</code> as the changing part of your filename. This way, you don't have to store and retrieve the previous value. Using the <code>ToBinary()</code> method, you can get a numeric representation of the time. Of course, any time format that is acceptable in a filename can be used - see custom date and time format strings.

There's a potential problem with long-running workflows that are persisted in a database, as they can't trigger events until reloaded, creating a catch-22. The proper solution is to use an external service for asynchronous operations, separating the workflow's "why" and "how".

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is a potential problem here with regard to workflow persistence. And we have a catch 22 :-(
The proper way to do this is using an external service. The reason is that the workflow is responsible for the big picture, IE what should be done. That way you can change the how without changing the why and when part.

Creating a custom <code>__reversed__</code> is only possible since 2.6, so you can't simply implement that and have <code>reversed</code> working in 2.5. In 2.5 and below, you can however make your custom class still working with <code>reversed</code> by implementing the sequence protocol (i.e. implement both <code>__len__</code> and <code>__getitem__</code>). However, I wouldn't recommend that as it changes the normal behaviour of built-in functions (obviously) and might confuse other users.. So you should rather implement the sequnce protocol to make <code>reversed</code> working.

To design a 9-key keyboard layout like QWERTY, you need a keyboard input routine that handles key presses and releases, cursor movement, and entry confirmation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
To do a really good design, you'll need a keyboard input routine which can tell when keys have been held for awhile, and when they have been released for awhile. For a short time after a digit is pressed, you should keep the cursor on the newly-typed character; if the same digit is pushed again, you should change the newly-typed character. If another digit is typed, make the selected digit 'permanent' and show the cursor on the character for the new key. If no key is pushed for a second or so, advance the cursor to the next position. If enter is pushed when the cursor is on a newly-typed digit, just advance the cursor.

GCC is right, this is not standard-compliant C++ code (seeing as even a for loop variable "i" is not redeclared sometimes). PS
However, I'd mention that the design of the class is questionable. A class should encapsulate some single responsibility and should not manipulate collections of itself, this functionality belongs to outside of the class.

The region object can't be directly serialized as it isn't marked with Serializable.

From speed tests that have been done, using SQL Adapters (ADO.Net) is the fastest way to get your information. However, considering you're on .Net, I'd recommend using LINQ if possible - it's much much cleaner and quicker to work with. That being said, unless your queries are massive, what you're using should be extremely fast.

Oracle treats an inline view as a table, potentially using predicate pushing and indexes, allowing for efficient query execution.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Oracle will effectively treat this inline view as a table. It can use predicate pushing to apply a filter on the inline view to the base tables, and potentially use an index. This type of query structure is called an inline view. Ideally, an inline view would work exactly like a pre-built table with the same data. But in general you are definitely on the right path - build a large query by assembling small inline views, and assume that Oracle will optimize it correctly.

Ground truth:
When opening a UTF-8 file with the <code>codecs</code> module, as you did, the contents of the file are automatically decoded into Unicode strings, so you must not try to decode them again. The same is true when writing the file; if you write it using the <code>codecs</code> module, the Unicode string you're passing will automatically be encoded to whatever encoding you specified.

To review a SQL script in MySQL Workbench, use the following steps: 

1. Check the generated script for potential issues before sending it to the server.
2. Use the `DELIMITER` command to switch the delimiter to a custom character (usually necessary for stored procedures with semicolons).

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
1) MySQL Workbench offers the option to review the generated SQL script before it is sent to the server. The <code>DELIMITER</code> command is usually necessary to switch the current delimiter that ends a single statement (which is by default a semicolon) to something else because the stored procedure code itself needs the semicolon to separate individual commands. However the sp code must be sent as a whole to the server. A few more details: the <code>DELIMITER</code> keywword is a client keyword only, that means the server doesn't know it and doesn't need it. It's an invention for clients to properly separate sql commands before sending them to the server (you cannot send a list of commands to a server, only individual statements). This might disappear in future version but for now just ignore it.

Ground truth:
Using the $1 will work, however be aware that you should probably use quotation marks when passing a number like 003 in stead of 3 as in some cases the two zeros in front might be dropped. Also I recommend wrapping the string in quotation marks as well, avoiding accidental command calls.

To achieve multiple criteria in an Access query, use a subquery to get the minimum and maximum agency values for each account, then join this with the original table and use unions to create the desired "Letter Type" column.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
To achieve the desired result in Access, I would try to un-pivot the first table and get the min and max of each agency as such: I might save this query as "MinMaxAgencyQuery" and then use it to create my "Letter Type" column. If I needed to do this all in the same query, I would substitute my first query in each of the three unioned queries like so: You never specified what becomes of account#'s that have no values for Agency1, Agency2, and Agency3, and so they would not be shown given this solution.

A "param is missing or the value is empty: exercise" error was resolved by removing the `method: :index` argument from a link in the `show_workout` route, correcting the usage of `params[:id]`, updating the `form_for` object, and changing `exercise_path` to `workout_exercise_path`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I had a chat with Liz and it appears that the problem was from the <code>show_workout</code> route, where the <code>method: :index</code> was added as an argument to the link_to, which resulted in a POST(instead of a GET) request to the workout_exercise_path. The router directed this to the create action, which was resulted in the aforementioned error. Resolving this required removing the method: :index. The fix was to change this to workout_exercise_path(@workout, exercise)

This implementation is not a Factory or a Service Locator, as it doesn't create new instances or return distinct interfaces. It's a simple "locator" that returns objects implementing a single common interface.

Ground truth:
This implementation is not the Factory because it doesn't create new instances. It isn't Service Locator either, because it is not locating services - now this requires a few words of explanation. Bottom line, negative consequences appear when a class doesn't declare its dependencies explicitly. Your class depends on SomeInterface and then asks for the resolver object which also knows of SomeInterface. I don't see negative consequences there.

2. Wrapping the test runner task to load fixtures first.

With the goal to make sure fixtures are loaded before classes there is a couple of directions to explore. One is to detect when fixtures finish loading and force reload the <code>Thing</code> class for it to generate proper scopes. Another, more promising approach is described in this answer and consists in putting the test runner task in a wrapper which ensures fixtures are loaded first.

To be more specific, all of the files in <code>env/bin</code> had the shebang <code>#!/codebuild/output/src715682316/src/env/bin/python</code>, so of course running <code>env/bin/gunicorn</code> on the production server would fail.

Load the Angular app in the new window instead of trying to render a directive in a popup, to avoid maintenance issues and unnecessary file downloads.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The correct way to handle this situatin it to load the app in the new window. This would be no different than someone doing a right-click open in new window. Attempting to build a second sub-sub site where some components can be used is going to be a maintenance nightmare. An alternative would be to create a second top level module that pulling in only the components you need but again this is a lot of ectra work on your end and your users would need to download additional files.

Ground truth:
Takes into account empty spaces within the <code>class</code> attribute: Of course this is a very generalized scenario and some things should be taken into account, such as the use of the <code>querySelectorAll</code>, which should be more specific probably, then searching the whole document for nodes with classes.

To add a margin between buttons in Bootstrap, use the `margin` property in CSS, or consider using Bootstrap's grid classes such as `col-xs-*` to keep buttons horizontal at all times.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You are apparently using Bootstrap so after removing all your CSS and just using basic bootstrap markup, buttons are evenly spaced. But Buttons are inline elements, if they are not being laid out correctly it's due to your combination of html/css overriding default behaviors. Also, keep in mind that the bootstrap <code>xs</code> grid classes (  <code>col-xs-*</code> ) keeps things horizontal at all times regardless of media size.

you still need Perl installed, but that is taken for granted in most

So to be fair the lack of visual cue and the compiler deprecation warning caused me to question the sample code as a new user, but the story that the code tells is valid.

Compare case-insensitive strings by converting the input to lower case using the `lower()` method.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When comparing case-insensitive strings, it is common practice to compare all with lower case. In fact, in your program, there is no point of comparing the input with <code>London</code> (with capital "l"), that's why you should compare with <code>london</code> instead. This is better so you can keep the user's input as is, maybe you'll use it in another way later.

CTRL+C is wired to the console window, not VS. To prevent this, use `SetConsoleMode` to treat CTRL+C as input instead of a break operation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
CTRL-C is wired directly to the console window itself for the 'break' operation. It aborts the ping. However, you can still tell the console directly to ignore CTRL-C and treat it as straight input yourself with SetConsoleMode. Just put the call with your chosen mode options at the beginning of your program and you should be good to go! Hope this helps!

One way to organize code is to use a switch statement to include separate PHP files for different form actions, such as processing, editing, or removing data.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One way of managing where your code is, is for each of your forms to have a hidden field describing what the form does. Then you can check what form was submitted back and include another php file to deal with it. This way you ought to be able to separate your code from each other. Either way, it's a lot easier to maintain code this way. There are many patterns of organising code and this is just one of them.

To align text in Illustrator CS5, set the text field to "justify (all characters)" in the paragraph panel, or use one of two alternative methods: adjust tracking manually or split the text into individual fields and distribute them equally using the align panel.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When you create a text field, you can set its adjustment to "justify (all characters)" (you have to expand the paragraph panel for that, it's the most right adjustment). Then the text you enter is automatically distributed. Otherwise, you can also emulate that behaviour in one of these two ways: You can either change the distance between the character manually by increasing the tracking in the character panel (I don't know its correct english name); it's the control with the "A V" and the arrow below. Or you can split the text field into one for each character and distribute that equally using the align panel.

The MMORPG Ryzom was open sourced a few days ago (blog post). While I'm not that well versed in game programming, paroneayea's comment on reddit makes me think it's worth a look:

It's hard to understate how big of a release this is. The fact that anyone can run their own MMORPG server, or contribute back useful assets to make it into the main server! Honestly I don't think I've been this excited about the freeing of a project since Blender was released as free and open source software nearly a decade ago.

The data is likely stored as text with leading zeros in Excel, which OleDb reads as strings.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I bet the data is stored in the Excel spreadsheet as text; because it wouldn't natively have leading zeroes (although the cells could be formatted to show them.) I expect OleDb is asking Excel what datatype, and Excel thinks they are strings. If ihis is the case (or even if it's not, but you want unformatted data), one way off the top of my head would be to copy the worksheet to another worksheet and transform the Excel column with the Val(address) function, and reformat it without leading zeroes; then read from that.

Clarifications are needed: the questioner's query might be using a foreign key in table2 (sub_id) linking to table1, and the Model->recursive property affects the depth of model relations in the query.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Supernovah -
Please clarify one thing for me: you write that you want to only have values put into $data when table1.id is found in table2.sub_id. I think Beau is right -- if you have the models correctly linked, using a HABTM or belongsTo, etc., variable, the findAll should automatically pull the associated records from table2. If you have changed the value of the recursive property in your code, it would alter how deep the model relations are allowed to go on a given query.
HTH!

The issue is likely due to the driver judging the column as numeric, causing NULL or 0 values. Try dropping the IMEX setting, or adding a single quote to the first character of each cell in the column to force it as text.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Are your first 10 rows pure numeric data? Then the driver is making a judgment call that the whole column is numeric. I would try:
1) drop the IMEX - experiment without it
2) Try adding a single quote as the first character to all the data in that column. This should force the driver to see the column as text.

The question is unclear, but a suggested database structure to track product sales would have fields for ProductID, ArrivalDate, Price, InStock, and DateSold.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
From what I interpret, here's the structure of your database: Which sorta confuses me, since each value in the database has no price attribute. Personally, I think your idea to find out price sold is flawed. It would make more sense to add a few more fields to your database: In changing your database, you can easily keep track of when a product arrives, the date sold, its price, maybe quantity (I can't tell if its an actual field or not).

A Java framework to manage bidirectional associations and inverse updates between two classes involves using a package-private mechanism to maintain consistency. The classes are peers, and the association is managed through methods `addA` and `removeA` in class `B` and `setB` in class `A`.

You can use Glazed Lists' ObservableElementList to handle association synchronization, and PropertyChangeSupport for detecting changes. Alternatively, you can create a custom framework with interfaces like Connector and Synchronizer to manage bidirectional associations and inverse updates.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism. If your objects are JavaBeans, then you are looking at using PropertyChangeSupport and firing property change events. If you do that (or have some other mechanism for detecting changes), then Glazed Lists provides an ObservableElementList that could easily be used to handle the association synchronization from the list end (i.e. adding A to List&lt; A&gt; automatically calls a.setB(b)). I realize that this isn't a generic solution, but it seems like it would be an easy foundation for one. We use both techniques in concert with each other in almost all of our applications, but have never tried to go quite as abstract as what you are asking about. With the above in place, it would be possible to have a number of pre-defined Connectors and Synchronizers that meet different binding criteria.

You could try something along these lines: The "sed" command removes the header line (line 1), and all spaces from alexa_products.csv. Then the remainder of the file is sorted using "sort" and saved as file "a". Likewise, file "data_products" has its header and spaces removed, gets sorted and stored in file "b". Then "join" uses field 1 of file "a" and matches it with field "2" in file b and prints where they match.

            <RowDefinition Height="Auto"/>
            <RowDefinition Height="Auto"/>

        </Grid.RowDefinitions>
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Path = Title}" Width="Auto" Height="Auto" FontWeight="Bold" Grid.Row="0"/>
        <TextBlock Text ="-----------------------------" Width="Auto" Height="Auto" Grid.Row="1"/>
        <sdk:DataGrid Grid.Row="2" ItemsSource="{Binding Path = Data}">
            <sdk:DataGrid.Columns>
                <sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Keys}"/>
                <sdk:DataGridTextColumn Binding="{Binding Values}"/>
            </sdk:DataGrid.Columns>
        </sdk:DataGrid>
    </Grid>
</DataTemplate>
```

Remove unnecessary containers (StackPanels) and use a DataGrid directly for displaying multi-row, multi-column data. Apply the DataTemplate as an ItemTemplate to a control like ListBox to see the repetitive structure.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In most case when your <code>StackPanel</code> or any other container control contains only single control, that means you don't need the container. You need to choose either to use <code>ItemsControl</code> or <code>DataGrid</code> in this part. But as you said in comment, you didn't see a <em>repetitive structure</em> when trying to debug, then the problem possibly resides in the place where you use the <code>DataTemplate</code>. You should use <code>DataTemplate</code> as Item Template of a control that can show multiple items such as <code>ListBox</code> or the same to be able to see that <em>repetitive structure</em>.

Ground truth:
The database (MongoDB) can not sort by arbitrary value, so you will have to do this in your application. This is a very specific type of sorting, and I doubt you would fine any database that can do this—except for perhaps SQLite where you can call out into your (scripting) language to set your sorting comparison function.

The solution to the `FileNotFoundException` was two-fold:

Ground truth:
There were a few mistakes with what I was doing,firstly I was passing the wrong parameter <code>Vaue</code> instead of <code>Value</code> to the service. Secondly,I was trying to parse a response when no response was being sent. And finally I used this to send the data to the web-service as binary data:

When opening a new window in JavaScript, provide the full URL to avoid relative paths, and be aware of potential redirects and limitations on content transfer between windows.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You should provide the full url when possible, else it tries to use the relative url. <code>var printWindow = window.open('', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> would open a blank url
<code>var printWindow = window.open('print.aspx', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> opens page <em>print.aspx</em> relative to current url. So if current url is <em>www.google.com</em>, it opens <em>www.google.com/print.aspx</em>, which would be 404 page not found. For example if you run this on current stackoverflow page it would open this page itself because <em><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18633800/xxxxxx/print.aspx</code></em> would redirect to <em><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18633800/xxxxxx</code></em>
Also the jquery wont work because you cannot copy content from one window to another through javascript.

To send a custom message to one friend using the iOS Facebook Graph API, set up an XMPP server, request the `xmpp_login` permission, and use a framework like SleekXMPP to send the message.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The way to do this is to set up a simple XMPP server on your server and send it using their XMPP login which you can get with the following code snippet. There are some nice frameworks that make XMPP really easy to implement on a simple level, such as SleekXMPP for python/django. It's definitely a little work to do this, but probably much more effective.

The code tries to access a resource named "src/frogger/highScores.DAT" which is not available outside the IDE, as it's not packaged with the application. Use `getClass().getResourceAsStream("/frogger/highScores.DAT")` or `getClass().getResourceAsStream("highScores.DAT")` for relative lookup.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your code refers to a src folder which ought to be not present anymore, if your code is deployed. But if you deploy your application you have to care that the file is packaged with it. Note that the NullPointerException comes naturally as you are catching the IOException and then proceeding as nothing has happened with an uninitialized Reader. You should rather ensure the code dealing with the resource is not executed when the allocation fails. But for things like highscores you should consider the Preferences API instead which gives you a persistent storage independent from your application’s location.

The `DragDropEffect.Copy` resets to `None` because it's not an allowed effect in the `DragEventArgs.AllowedEffects` property. To use `DragDropEffect.Copy`, set it when calling `DoDragDrop` or `BeginDragDrop`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
What is the <code>(DragEventArgs).AllowedEffects</code> property value? You can only set the <code>(DragEventArgs).Effects</code> property to one of the values specified by the <code>(DragEventArgs).AllowedEffects</code> property. Copy</code> is not an option found in the <code>(DragEventArgs).AllowedEffects</code> property enumeration, then you will <em>not</em> be able to use that function. UPDATE &gt;&gt;&gt;
As I said, normally, you set the allowable <code>DragDropEffects</code> enumeration when you call <code>DoDragDrop</code>... I'm guessing that the last parameter here is where you set the <code>DragDropEffects</code> allowable effect enumeration.
