Question: What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?
Answer: 
Both MVP and MVC frameworks separate concerns into model, application logic (controller/presenter), and display code (view). The key difference lies in how they interact: in MVC, the view and controller interact with the model, but not with each other, whereas in MVP, the presenter interacts with both the model and the view.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View). The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view.

Question: What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?
Answer: 
Summary: MVP and MVC are software design patterns with key differences: 
- In MVP, the view is loosely coupled to the model, and the presenter binds the model to the view.
- In MVC, the controller determines which view to display and can be shared across views.

Inversion of Control is a design pattern that turns sequentially written code into a delegation structure, reducing code duplication by allowing the program to set up a class or library to handle events and tasks, making it easier to reuse code, but should be used sparingly to maintain code clarity.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. It solves code duplication. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control.

### Example
Question: C# loop - break vs. continue
Answer: A really easy way to understand this is to place the word "loop" after each of the keywords. The terms now make sense if they are just read like everyday phrases. <strong><code>break</code></strong> loop - looping is broken and stops. <strong><code>continue</code></strong> loop - loop continues to execute with the next iteration.

Summary: Break loop stops execution, continue loop moves to the next iteration.

### Example
Question: C# loop - break vs. continue
Answer: 
The author discusses the use of `break` and `continue` in C# loops. They suggest using `break` when searching a list and finding the desired item, and `continue` when processing a list but skipping certain elements.

Extractive summary:
But I find that sometimes using one of them really simplifies things, especially if your language doesn't include a <code>do-while</code> or <code>do-until</code> style of loop. I tend to use <code>break</code> in loops that are searching a list for something. I use <code>continue</code> when doing something with most elements of a list, but still want to skip over a few. The <code>do-until</code> loop that I mentioned before is the more elegant solution for that particular problem:

Ground truth:
I tend to use <code>break</code> in loops that are searching a list for something. Once found, there's no point in continuing, so you might as well quit. I use <code>continue</code> when doing something with most elements of a list, but still want to skip over a few. The <code>break</code> statement also comes in handy when polling for a valid response from somebody or something.

Generated abstractive summary:
In Ruby, break and next have different meanings in the context of a block. break will exit the code that called the block, while next will skip the rest of the code in the block and return a specified value to the block's caller.

Extractive summary:
So yeah.

Ground truth:
Ruby unfortunately is a bit different. break will jump out of the code that called the block next will skip the rest of the code in the block, and 'return' what you specify to the caller of the block.

Question: IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?
Answer: If you're using the argument in your method, it might be redundant to explicitly check for a null as the VM already does it for you.

I removed the phrase "If you choose to throw a NPE" as it was not crucial to the main point of the answer. The summary now directly conveys the key information: the JVM checks for null parameters and it's redundant to explicitly check for it.

Question: What is the difference between #include <filename> and #include "filename"?
Answer: The difference lies in the location where the preprocessor searches for the included file, with <filename> searching implementation-dependent directories for standard library header files and "filename" searching the same directory and then implementation-dependent directories for programmer-defined header files.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In practice, the difference is in the location where the preprocessor searches for the included file. For <code>#include &lt;filename&gt;</code> the preprocessor searches in an implementation dependent manner, normally in search directories pre-designated by the compiler/IDE. For <code>#include "filename"</code> the preprocessor searches first in the same directory as the file containing the directive, and then follows the search path used for the <code>#include &lt;filename&gt;</code> form.

Question: IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?
Answer: The choice between throwing an IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException is a matter of personal preference, but IllegalArgumentException is more specific as it indicates a problem with the method argument.

Let me know if you'd like me to create a summary for another question.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In my mind IllegalArgumentException seems more specific than using a NPE since it's telling me that the problem was with an argument I passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method.

When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the following key points:

- Ensure equals() defines an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and consistent).
- hashCode() must be consistent if the object's equals() value does not change.
- The relation between equals() and hashCode() is that they must return the same value if equals() returns true.
- If overriding one, override the other using the same set of fields.
- Use helper classes like EqualsBuilder and HashCodeBuilder from Apache Commons Lang library.
- Ensure key objects in hash-based collections do not change their hashCode() while in the collection, making keys immutable.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The theory (for the language lawyers and the mathematically inclined): <code>equals()</code> (javadoc) must define an equivalence relation (it must be <em>reflexive</em>, <em>symmetric</em>, and <em>transitive</em>). In addition, it must be <em>consistent</em> (if the objects are not modified, then it must keep returning the same value). Furthermore, <code>o.equals(null)</code> must always return false.

Here is the summary for the new example:

When overriding `equals` and `hashCode` in Java, consider the following issues: 

1. Use `instanceof` for class equality checks in `final` implementations or when implementing an interface.
2. Use `this.getClass().equals(that.getClass())` for safe extension of classes without overriding `equals`.
3. Ensure consistency between `equals` and `compareTo` methods if the class implements `Comparable`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There are a couple of ways to do your check for class equality before checking member equality, and I think both are useful in the right circumstances. <li>Use the <code>instanceof</code> operator. <li>Use <code>this.getClass().equals(that.getClass())</code>.

A race condition occurs in multi-threaded applications or systems, where an assumption is made about the order of events between different threads or processes without ensuring it, often due to shared resources and concurrent access.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems. A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do. This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access. Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals. Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs.

A NoSuchMethodError typically occurs due to a mismatch in class versions when compiling and running the code.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Without any more information it is difficult to pinpoint the problem, but the root cause is that you most likely have compiled a class against a different version of the class that is missing a method, than the one you are using when running it. If the exception appears when calling a method on an object in a library, you are most likely using separate versions of the library when compiling and running. Make sure you have the right version both places. If the exception appears when calling a method on objects instantiated by classes <em>you</em> made, then your build process seems to be faulty. Make sure the class files that you are actually running are updated when you compile.

The `yield` keyword in C# is used to implement the `IEnumerable` interface, allowing a function to return an object that can be iterated over, and enabling syntactic sugar for creating enumerators, introduced in C# 2.0.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If a calling function starts foreach-ing over this object the function is called again until it "yields". The easiest way understand code like this is to type in an example, set some breakpoints and see what happens. Try stepping through this for example: BIGBLOCK Here is a real-life example BIGBLOCK

Here's a concise summary:

The yield keyword in C# is used to pass control over to the caller with each element of a collection, allowing the caller to perform operations on each element.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The Array's each method implementation <strong>yields</strong> control over to the caller (the 'puts x') with <strong>each</strong> element of the array neatly presented as x. However <strong>.Net</strong> doesn't go all the way here.. C# seems to have coupled yield with IEnumerable, in a way forcing you to write a foreach loop in the caller as seen in Mendelt's response.

The `foreach` loop in C# does not support getting the index of the current iteration because it uses an enumerator, which does not support indexing.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The <code>foreach</code> is for iterating over collections that implement <code>IEnumerable</code>. It does this by calling <code>GetEnumerator</code> on the collection, which will return an <code>Enumerator</code>. Because of that, most collections are able to be traversed using an indexer and the for loop construct.

Generated abstractive summary:
It's only possible to get the index of the current iteration of a foreach loop for a List, not any IEnumerable, using a method in LINQ.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It's only going to work for a List and not any IEnumerable, but in LINQ there's this: That said, List might keep an index of each object along with the count. It would be better to just keep a count of where you're up to in the foreach though, simpler, and more adaptable.

Question: How do I position one image on top of another in HTML?
Answer: The HTML `width` and `height` attributes should be replaced with CSS `width` and `height` properties to specify units, and a content-type should be provided with the `<style>` tag.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The HTML <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes do not allow for units; you're likely thinking of the CSS <code>width:</code> and <code>height:</code> properties. You should also provide a content-type (<code>text/css</code>; see Espo's code) with the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag. Leaving <code>px;</code> in the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes might cause a rendering engine to balk.

The difference between #include <filename> and #include "filename" is that the latter form first looks for a file with the given name if supported, before treating it as a header.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The sequence of characters between &lt; and > uniquely refer to a header, which isn't necessarily a file. If the <code>#include "file"</code> form is used, the implementation first looks for a file of the given name, if supported. If not (supported), or if the search fails, the implementation behaves as though the other (<code>#include &lt;file&gt;</code>) form was used.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
An unsigned char provides a range of values from 0 to 255 when CHAR_BIT is 8, compared to a regular char's range of [0, 127]. It is used for examining the representation and bit patterns of objects.

Extractive summary:
For example, if <code>CHAR_BIT</code> is 8, the range of regular <code>char</code> is only guaranteed to be [0, 127] (because it can be signed or unsigned) while <code>unsigned char</code> will be [0, 255] and <code>signed char</code> will be [-127, 127].

Ground truth:
In terms of direct values a regular char is used when the values are known to be between <code>CHAR_MIN</code> and <code>CHAR_MAX</code> while an unsigned char provides double the range on the positive end. For example, if <code>CHAR_BIT</code> is 8, the range of regular <code>char</code> is only guaranteed to be [0, 127] (because it can be signed or unsigned) while <code>unsigned char</code> will be [0, 255] and <code>signed char</code> will be [-127, 127].

An unsigned char is a data type that uses the sign bit as an additional number, changing its range to [0-255] instead of [-128-127].

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
An unsigned char uses the bit that is reserved for the sign of a regular char as another number. This changes the range to [0 - 255] as opposed to [-128 - 127]. Generally unsigned chars are used when you don't want a sign.

Generated abstractive summary:
The "using" keyword in C# allows for the creation of IDisposable classes that start an operation in the constructor and finish it in the Dispose method, enabling the use of the "using" syntax to denote the start and end of the operation.

Extractive summary:
If you have something that needs to happen after a certain operation ... something that has a definite start and end ... then you can simply make an IDisposable class that starts the operation in the constructor, and then finishes in the Dispose method.

Ground truth:
Basically, you can take advantage of the fact that the compiler will <strong>always</strong> call .Dispose on the "used" object. If you have something that needs to happen after a certain operation ... something that has a definite start and end ... then you can simply make an IDisposable class that starts the operation in the constructor, and then finishes in the Dispose method. This is also how the System.Transactions stuff works.

The difference between #include <filename> and #include "filename" is the search order for the file. The angle-bracket form (<filename>) searches system directories first, while the double-quote form ("filename") searches the current directory first.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> include tells the preprocessor to search in <code>-I</code> directories and in predefined directories first, then in the .c file's directory. The <code>"file"</code> include tells the preprocessor to search the source file's directory first, and then revert to <code>-I</code> and predefined. All destinations are searched anyway, only the order of search is different. A preprocessing directive of the form searches a sequence of implementation-defined places for a header identified uniquely by the specified sequence between the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> delimiters, and causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the header. A preprocessing directive of the form causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified by the specified sequence between the <code>"</code> delimiters. If this search is not supported, or if the search fails, the directive is reprocessed as if it read with the identical contained sequence (including <code>&gt;</code> characters, if any) from the original   directive.

Unsigned char is a data type that represents a single byte in the range [0, 255]. It is commonly used in computer graphics for colour representation, where each colour component is assigned a single byte. This data type is preferred over signed char due to the potential issues with arithmetic and bit shifting operations when dealing with negative values.

Extractive summary:

Since unsigned char values fall in the range [0,255], the values are typically interpreted as As explained already, a signed char's range is essentially shifted by -128.

To ignore files in Subversion, you can use one of three methods: 

1. The `global-ignores` option in the Runtime Configuration Area, which applies to all repositories on your computer.
2. The `svn:ignore` property, which is set on directories and is stored within the repository, affecting all users.
3. The `svn:global-ignores` property, which is similar to `svn:ignore` but applies to all descendant directories automatically.

To list ignored files, use `svn status` with the `--no-ignore` option and pipe the output to `grep` to show only ignored files.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Subversion, as of version 1.8 (June 2013) and later, supports 3 different ways of specifying file patterns. The command <code>svn status</code> will hide ignored files (that is, files that match an RGA <code>global-ignores</code> pattern, or match an immediate parent directory's <code>svn:ignore</code> pattern or match any ancesor directory's <code>svn:global-ignores</code> pattern.

Question: Why is using the JavaScript eval function a bad idea?
Answer: Using eval can be problematic due to its over-use by inexperienced developers, leading to security risks and bugs. It can often be replaced with safer and cleaner alternatives, such as using square brackets for object property access.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
So the more we can do to throw a question mark over eval, the better. To give an all-too-typical example, to set the colour of an element with an id stored in the variable 'potato': BIGBLOCK If the authors of the kind of code above had a clue about the basics of how JavaScript objects work, they'd have realised that square brackets can be used instead of literal dot-names, obviating the need for eval: BIGBLOCK ...which is much easier to read as well as less potentially buggy.

Answer: Using the JavaScript eval function is generally discouraged for own code due to security risks, but can be useful as a workaround in restricted environments like social networking sites.

One thing to keep in mind is that you can often use eval() to execute code in an otherwise restricted environment - social networking sites that block specific JavaScript functions can sometimes be fooled by breaking them up in an eval block - BIGBLOCK However, for all the reasons mentioned above, you shouldn't use it for your own code, where you have complete control - it's just not necessary, and better-off relegated to the 'tricky JavaScript hacks' shelf.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

Views in Oracle evaluate the underlying table data at query time, returning the latest data but potentially performing poorly if the underlying select statement is complex. Materialized views, on the other hand, store the query resultset in a table, allowing for faster query performance and enabling query rewrite optimization, but with data only as up-to-date as the last refresh.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Views evaluate the data in the tables underlying the view definition at the time the view is queried. It is a logical view of your tables, with no data stored anywhere else. Materialized views are similar to regular views, in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement), however, the underlying query resultset has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view, you are querying a table, which may also be indexed. The downside though is that the data you get back from the materialized view is only as up to date as the last time the materialized view has been refreshed. Materialized views are most often used in data warehousing / business intelligence applications where querying large fact tables with thousands of millions of rows would result in query response times that resulted in an unusable application.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

A metaclass is the class of a class, defining how a class behaves. It is an instance of another class, typically subclassing the built-in `type` metaclass. Metaclasses are used as class-factories, allowing you to perform actions when a class is created, such as registering the class or replacing it with another. They can also define methods and implement magic methods to customize class behavior.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves, a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass <code>type</code>. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the <code>__metaclass__</code> attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the <code>__metaclass__</code> global variable.

Here's a concise summary:

MVC and MVP are architectural patterns for separated presentation in software development. 

- **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)**: The Presenter contains UI business logic and interacts with the View through an interface, allowing for unit testing. It's commonly used in Web Forms and has two variations: 
  - Passive View: The View is dumb and the Presenter manages all state.
  - Supervising Controller: The Presenter handles user gestures and the View binds directly to the Model.

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: The Controller determines which View to display in response to actions and is responsible for processing requests. The View is stateless and does not bind directly to the Model.

- **Presentation Model (MVVM)**: The View binds directly to a Presentation Model, which is a Model crafted for the View and exposes properties and commands for the View to use. This pattern is suitable for WPF applications and allows for the removal of code-behind.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In MVP, the Presenter contains the UI business logic for the View. In the MVC, the Controller is responsible for determining which View to display in response to any action including when the application loads.

Ground truth:
For example, TheGun, a very small text editor written in assembly language, claims to "<em>not have an effective file size limit and the maximum size that can be loaded into it is determined by available memory and loading speed of the file. To abstract the memory limit, I suppose one can use mapped memory. But then, if you need to edit the file, some clever method should be used, like storing in memory the local changes, and applying them chunk by chunk when saving.

A smart pointer is a pointer that automatically deletes the object it points to when it goes out of scope, useful for managing objects with a lifetime tied to a specific scope or data members of classes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A smart pointer is like a regular (typed) pointer, like "char*", except when the pointer itself goes out of scope then what it points to is deleted as well. You can use it like you would a regular pointer, by using "->", but not if you need an actual pointer to the data.

Question: What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?
Answer: Smart pointers handle object disposal automatically, eliminating the need for manual object disposal. The most commonly used smart pointers are <code>std::tr1::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::auto_ptr</code>, with <code>shared_ptr</code> being the recommended choice due to its versatility.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Most kinds of smart pointers handle disposing of the pointer-to object for you. It's very handy because you don't have to think about disposing of objects manually anymore.

Generated abstractive summary:
A smart pointer is a class that manages the lifetime of an object being pointed to, abstracting a raw pointer in a practical way. It alleviates problems associated with raw pointers, such as memory leaks, by automatically destroying the object when it is no longer needed. There are two main types of smart pointers: scoped pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`) and reference-counted pointers (e.g., `std::shared_ptr`), each with their own policy for managing object lifetime.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A smart pointer is a class that wraps a 'raw' (or 'bare') C++ pointer, to manage the lifetime of the object being pointed to. If you feel you need to use pointers (first consider if you really do), you would normally want to use a smart pointer as this can alleviate many of the problems with raw pointers, mainly forgetting to delete the object and leaking memory.

A smart pointer is a class that overloads the -> and * operators, providing pointer-like functionality with additional features such as reference counting and automatic destruction.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A smart pointer is simply a class that overloads the <code>-&gt;</code>  and <code>*</code> operators. Which means that your object semantically looks like a pointer but you can make it do way cooler things, including reference counting, automatic destruction etc.

In A, 3 is tested for equality against each member of the set, yielding (FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, UNKNOWN). In B, I think it is evaluating the condition as NOT (3 in (1,2,null)). NOT ( UNKNOWN ) yields UNKNOWN. So overall the truth of the condition is unknown, which at the end is essentially treated as FALSE.

Optimistic locking assumes nothing will change, while pessimistic locking assumes changes will occur, locking the data to prevent dirty reads. Optimistic locking is suitable for non-essential data, while pessimistic locking is necessary for exact data operations where accuracy is critical.

Ground truth:
Optimistic assumes that nothing's going to change while you're reading it. Pessimistic assumes that something will and so locks it. Most web applications are fine with dirty reads - on the rare occasion the data doesn't exactly tally the next reload does.

Optimistic Locking checks the version of a record before updating it, ensuring it hasn't changed since being read, while Pessimistic Locking locks a record exclusively until finished with it, providing better integrity but requiring careful application design and direct database connection or transaction ID management.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, take note of a version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or checksums/hashes) and check that the version hasn't changed before you write the record back. Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it.

Question: What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?
Answer: A staticmethod knows nothing about the class or instance it was called on, while a classmethod gets the class it was called on as the first argument, making it useful for class factories.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A <strong>staticmethod</strong> is a method that knows nothing about the class or instance it was called on. A <strong>classmethod</strong>, on the other hand, is a method that gets passed the class it was called on, or the class of the instance it was called on, as first argument. This is useful when you want the method to be a factory for the class: since it gets the actual class it was called on as first argument, you can always instantiate the right class, even when subclasses are involved.

Ground truth:
It is easily (ab)used as a global variable. Classes that depend on singletons are relatively harder to unit test in isolation.

The Singleton pattern is considered an anti-pattern by some due to its potential to introduce unnecessary limitations when a single instance of a class is not required.

Extractive summary:
It is also considered an anti-pattern by some people, who feel that it is overly used, introducing unnecessary limitations in situations where a sole instance of a class is not actually required.

Question: What is so bad about singletons?
Answer: Singletons make objects "pathological liars" by allowing them to secretly access and use global state, making it difficult to understand dependency chains and unit test an application.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Singletons are nothing more than global state. Global state makes it so your objects can secretly get hold of things which are not declared in their APIs, and, as a result, Singletons make your APIs into pathological liars.

Question: What is so bad about singletons?
Answer: It blurs the separation of concerns, creates confusion, and is anti-OOP by hiding the class's dependencies and requiring users to know the state of the singleton.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The whole idea of encapsulation is to hide the how of a method from the users, but if a singleton is used inside the method, one will have to know the state of the singleton in order to use the method correctly. This is anti-OOP.

Singletons are generally considered bad design because they hide application dependencies, cause tight coupling, make testing difficult, and carry state throughout the application's lifetime.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Because you hide the dependencies of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces. They violate the single responsibility principle: by virtue of the fact that they control their own creation and lifecycle. They inherently cause code to be tightly coupled. They carry state around for the lifetime of the application.

The singleton pattern can cause problems, including unmanageable classes, testing difficulties, memory management issues in garbage collected environments, and synchronization problems in multi-threaded scenarios.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When singletons are introduced in this context they tend to grow into unmanageable classes that contain helper methods for every little use. Singletons are also a problem from a testing perspective. There is also the multi-threaded scenario where singletons can become a bottleneck as well as a synchronization issue.

Bitwise shift operators are used for fast multiplication and division by powers of 2. They work by shifting bits left or right, effectively multiplying or dividing by 2. They can be used to optimize code, especially in low-level graphics routines, but modern compilers often perform the optimization automatically.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte. The bits don't rollover; they are discarded. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N. Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2N and rounding to zero.

Generated abstractive summary:
Bitwise shift operators in programming languages like C and C++ shift the bits of an integer value. There are three main types of shift operators: 

1. Left shift operator (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>): shifts bits to the left and is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2.
2. Logical right shift operator (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>): shifts bits to the right and is equivalent to division by powers of 2, padding with zeros.
3. Arithmetic right shift operator (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>): shifts bits to the right, preserving the sign bit, and is equivalent to division by powers of 2.

Ground truth:
The bit shifting operators do exactly what their name implies. They shift bits. <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the left shift operator, and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts. All of these operators can be applied to integer values (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, possibly <code>short</code> and <code>byte</code> or <code>char</code>). In some languages, applying the shift operators to any datatype smaller than <code>int</code> automatically resizes the operand to be an <code>int</code>.

Bitwise shift operators are used in low-level programming to access and manipulate specific bits within a binary value. They can be used to extract specific bitfields, perform fast multiplication and division by powers of 2, and are commonly used in graphics programming and binary file formats.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming. Accessing these bit-fields for reading/writing is the most common usage. <strong>Explanation</strong> In order to obtain the value of green ONLY, which starts at offset 5 and ends at 10 (i.e. 6-bits long), you need to use a (bit) mask, which when applied against the entire 16-bit pixel, will yield only the bits we are interested in. The appropriate mask is 0x7E0 which in binary is 0000011111100000 (which is 2016 in decimal). To apply a mask, you use the AND operator (&amp;).

Summary: A POD (Plain Old Data) type in C++ is a type that has no "magic" going on, meaning no hidden pointers, constructors, or destructors. Examples of POD types include built-in types, pointers, enums, and classes or structs with only public non-static POD members and no base classes, constructors, or virtual functions.

Extractive summary:
A POD is a type (including classes) where the C++ compiler guarantees that there will be no "magic" going on in the structure: for example hidden pointers to vtables, offsets that get applied to the address when it is cast to other types (at least if the target's POD too), constructors, or destructors.

The difference between a bare library and the framework on Mac is that a framework can contain multiple different versions of the library. A software framework is a re-usable  design for a software system (or  subsystem). A software framework may  include support programs, code  libraries, a scripting language, or  other software to help develop and  glue together the different components  of a software project. So I'd say a library is just that, "a library". It is basically a file containing re-usable code that can usually be shared among multiple applications (you don't have to write the same code over and over again).

Question: When to use self over $this?
Answer: Use $this to refer to the current object and self to refer to the current class. 

For non-static members, use $this->member, and for static members, use self::$member. 

This helps in polymorphism and suppressing polymorphic behavior.

Extractive summary:
Here is an example of <strong>suppressing polymorphic behaviour</strong> by using <code>self</code> for member functions:

Ground truth:
Use <code>$this</code> to refer to the current  object. Use <code>self</code> to refer to the  current class. In other words, use  <code>$this-&gt;member</code> for non-static members,  use <code>self::$member</code> for static members.

Answer: Use `self` for static member functions to access static member variables, and use `$this` for non-static member functions, referencing the current instance of the class.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>self</code> (not $self) refers to the <em>type</em> of class, where as <code>$this</code> refers to the current <em>instance</em> of the class. <code>self</code> is for use in static member functions to allow you to access static member variables. <code>$this</code> is used in non-static member functions, and is a reference to the instance of the class on which the member function was called.

Question: Polymorphism vs Overloading vs Overriding
Answer: Overloading is when methods have the same name but different parameters, overriding changes base class behavior in a subclass, and polymorphism is related to overriding but distinct.

Note: I condensed the answer into a single sentence, focusing on the key differences between the three concepts.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
overloading is when you define 2 methods with the same name but different parameters overriding is where you change the behavior of the base class via a function with the same name in a subclass. So Polymorphism is related to overriding but not really overloading.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

Polymorphism in programming refers to the ability of a language to treat different objects uniformly using a single interface. This is related to overriding, but the key difference lies in how the code is resolved: polymorphism involves dynamic resolution at runtime, whereas non-polymorphic code is resolved statically.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Polymorphism relates to the ability of a language to have different object treated uniformly by using a single interfaces; as such it is related to overriding, so the interface (or the base class) is polymorphic, the implementor is the object which overrides (two faces of the same medal)

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

Polymorphism is the ability of a class instance to behave like another class in its inheritance tree, while overriding is a function that replaces a base class function and is called when the instance is polymorphic. Overloading is a separate concept where multiple methods with the same name but different parameters are defined.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Polymorphism</strong> is the ability of a class instance to behave as if it were an instance of another class in its inheritance tree, most often one of its ancestor classes. An <strong>override</strong> is a type of function which occurs in a class which inherits from another class. An override function "replaces" a function inherited from the base class, but does so in such a way that it is called even when an instance of its class is pretending to be a different type through polymorphism.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

A function is a standalone piece of code called by name, with optional input parameters and a return value. A method is similar to a function but is associated with an object and has implicit access to the object's data.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A <strong>function</strong> is a piece of code that is called by name. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences: <li>A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. <li>A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).

There is no direct equivalent of the C++ Pair<L,R> in Java, as a generic Pair class is not recommended due to lack of semantic meaning. Instead, create a specific class for each application, such as Position(x,y) or Entry(key,value), which conveys its purpose.

To pass a string into subprocess.Popen using the stdin argument in Python, create the Popen object with stdin=PIPE and use communicate() to send the string to the process and get the result.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Note that if you want to send data to  the processÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ stdin, you need to  create the Popen object with  stdin=PIPE. <strong>Warning</strong> Use communicate() rather than  stdin.write(), stdout.read() or  stderr.read() to avoid deadlocks due  to any of the other OS pipe buffers  filling up and blocking the child  process. So your example could be written as follows: BIGBLOCK On the current Python 3 version, you could use <code>subprocess.run</code>, to pass input as a string to an external command and get its exit status, and its output as a string back in one call: BIGBLOCK

In Java, a destructor is the finalize() function, but it's not recommended for cleanup as it's called after garbage collection and its timing is unpredictable.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The <code>finalize()</code> function is the destructor.

### Example
Question: Is there a destructor for Java?
Answer: 
Java does not have a direct equivalent of a destructor due to its garbage collected nature, but it has a method called `finalize` that can be used for explicit cleanup, with a convention to use a `close` method instead.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Because Java is a garbage collected language you cannot predict when (or even if) an object will be destroyed. Hence there is no direct equivalent of a destructor.

Use of finalize() methods is discouraged in Java as they can cause problems with the garbage collector. Instead, use an explicit method call to release resources, typically via try/finally, and throw a runtime exception if the object is used after being disposed.

Generally, all you need to do is dereference the objects - at least, this is the way it is supposed to work.

In Java, since it's a garbage-collected language, a destructor is not typically needed, but you can use a PhantomReference to notify when an object has been destroyed and then manually clean up any necessary resources.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can be notified after an object has been destroyed using java.lang.ref.PhantomReference (actually, saying it has been destroyed may be slightly inaccurate, but if a phantom reference to it is queued then it's no longer recoverable, which usually amounts to the same thing). There is also finalize(), which looks like a destructor but doesn't behave like one.

Summary: Use a covering index or a multi-column index with additional non-key columns in SQL Server 2005 to optimize query performance.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If an index is "covering", then there is no need to use anything but the index. Having multiple indexes, each on a single column may mean that only one index gets used at all - you will have to refer to the execution plan to see what effects different indexing schemes offer. You can also use the tuning wizard to help determine what indexes would make a given query or workload perform the best.

Creating a single covering index with multiple columns can improve performance by reducing the need for direct table access, but it can also incur high overhead, especially with volatile data.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
By putting multiple columns in your index, the optimizer will only have to access the table directly if a column is not in the index. The downside is that doing this can cost a lot of overhead, especially if the data is very volatile. Index tuning is as much instinct as science.

Answer: A multi-column index is more efficient for queries referencing all columns, whereas single-column indexes are only useful for queries referencing one column at a time.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The multi-column index can be used for queries referencing <em>all</em> the columns: On the other hand, at most one of the single-column index can be used (it would have to look up all records having Column1=1, and then check Column2 and Column3 in each of those).

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
To summarize the answer to the question "Multiple Indexes vs Multi-Column Indexes", here's a concise version:

A multi-column index should be used when frequently used queries involve multiple columns, but a single-column index is preferred for frequently used queries that only involve a single column. The choice of index type depends on the specific WHERE and GROUP BY clauses of frequently used queries.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This article should get you on the right track: One thing to note, clustered indexes should have a unique key (an identity column I would recommend) as the first column. Secondly, if you are creating other indexes on your data and they are constructed cleverly they will be reused. <li>you sometimes search by state only. <li>you sometimes search by state and county. <li>you frequently search by state, county, zip. If you search by zip alone quite a lot then the above index will not be used (by SQL Server anyway) as zip is the third part of that index and the query optimiser will not see that index as helpful. You could then create an index on Zip alone that would be used in this instance.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Another consideration is the exit code to return. Just "<code>1</code>" is pretty standard, although there are a handful of reserved exit codes that bash itself uses, and that same page argues that user-defined codes should be in the range 64-113 to conform to C/C++ standards.

Here's a summary of the answer:

A shallow copy points to the same referenced objects as the source, while a deep copy creates a new version of each referenced object, resulting in two independent object trees.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With a shallow copy, any object pointed to by the source is also pointed to by the destination (so that no referenced objects are copied). With a deep copy, any object pointed to by the source is copied and the copy is pointed to by the destination (so there will now be 2 of each referenced object). This recurses down the object tree.

Shallow copy and deep copy differ in how they handle memory references. A shallow copy shares memory areas, while a deep copy creates separate areas.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The variables A and B refer to different areas of memory, when B is assigned to A the two variables refer to the same area of memory. Later modifications to the contents of either are instantly reflected in the contents of other, as they share contents. The variables A and B refer to different areas of memory, when B is assigned to A the values in the memory area which A points to are copied into the memory area to which B points. Later modifications to the contents of either remain unique to A or B; the contents are not shared.

Generated abstractive summary:
In object-oriented programming, the key difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy is that a shallow copy copies references to objects, while a deep copy creates a new instance of referenced objects, making changes to them independent of the original.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In a shallow copy, a new instance of the type is created and the values are copied into the new instance. In a deep copy, the fields that are stored by value are copied as before, but the pointers to objects stored by reference are not copied.

A mutex can only be released by the thread that has ownership, while a binary semaphore can be released by any thread. Additionally, a mutex does not block on repeated wait calls, but a binary semaphore blocks if a thread waits on it twice without releasing it in between.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A mutex can only be released by the thread which has ownership, i.e. the thread which previously called the Wait function, (or which took ownership when creating it). A semaphore can be released by any thread. A thread can call a wait function repeatedly on a mutex without blocking. However, if you call a wait function twice on a binary semaphore without releasing the semaphore in between, the thread will block.

To resolve the Oracle ORA-12154: TNS: Could not resolve service name error, use the `tnsping` command to verify the TNSNames is correct before attempting to connect.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
@Warren and @DCookie have covered the solution, one thing to emphasise is the use of <code>tnsping</code>. You can use this to prove your TNSNames is correct before attempting to connect. Once you have set up tnsnames correctly you could use ODBC or try TOra which will use your native oracle connection. TOra or something similar (TOAD, SQL*Plus etc) will prove invaluable in debugging and improving your SQL. Last but not least when you eventually connect with ASP.net remember that you can use the Oracle data connection libraries.

Question: IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?
Answer: Both alternatives are acceptable, but people have personal preferences.

This summary captures the key information: the debate between two options (IllegalArgumentException and NullPointerException) and the fact that personal preferences play a role in the decision.

Extractive summary:
It's a "Holy War" style question. In others words, both alternatives are good, but people will have their preferences which they will defend to the death.

Ground truth:
In others words, both alternatives are good, but people will have their preferences which they will defend to the death.

Bus errors occur when the processor cannot access memory due to incorrect alignment, while segmentation faults occur when accessing memory outside the process's allocated space, typically due to using a deallocated, uninitialized, null, or buffer-overflowed pointer.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Bus errors are rare nowadays on x86 and occur when your processor cannot even attempt the memory access requested, typically: <li>using a processor instruction with an address that does not satisfy its alignment requirements. Segmentation faults occur when accessing memory which does not belong to your process, they are very common and are typically the result of: <li>using a pointer to something that was deallocated. <li>using an uninitialized hence bogus pointer. <li>using a null pointer. <li>overflowing a buffer.

To use 'class' or 'typename' for template parameters, 'class' is preferred as it has no overloaded meaning within a template.

Extractive summary:
In response to Mike B, I prefer to use 'class' as, within a template, 'typename' has an overloaded meaning, but 'class' does not.

Ground truth:
In response to Mike B, I prefer to use 'class' as, within a template, 'typename' has an overloaded meaning, but 'class' does not. <code>larger_integer_t</code> is a dependent name, so it requires 'typename' to preceed it so that the parser can recognize that <code>larger_integer_t</code> is a type. <strong>class</strong>, on the otherhand, has no such overloaded meaning.

To split a string with any whitespace characters as delimiters, use a regular expression equivalent to `[ \\t\\n\\x0B\\f\\r]`, which can be represented as `\s` in a string, requiring it to be escaped as `\\s`.

Ground truth:
This should yield the strings <code>"Hello"</code> and <code>"World"</code> and omit the empty space between the <code>[space]</code> and the <code>[tab]</code>. What you want, is the literal <code>"\s"</code>, which means, you need to pass <code>"\\s"</code>. The <code>\\s</code> is equivalent to <code>[ \\t\\n\\x0B\\f\\r]</code>

When to use self over $this?

To refer to a specific instance of a class's variables or methods, use $this. To refer to a class's static variables or methods, use self. Static variables and methods are shared among all instances of a class and cannot refer to $this.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>$this-&gt;</code> is used to refer to a specific instance of a class's variables (member variables) or methods. If it helps, you can mentally replace the word "static" with "shared". <strong>SELF::</strong>If you are coding <em>outside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you must call it using the object's name View::format_phone_number($phone_number);If you are coding <em>inside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you can <em>either</em> use the object's name View::format_phone_number($pn), OR you can use the self::format_phone_number($pn)  shortcut The same goes for static variables:<strong>Example:</strong> View::templates_path versus self::templates_path Inside the DB class, if we were referring to a static method of some other object, we would use the object's name:<strong>Example:</strong> Session::getUsersOnline(); But if the DB class wanted to refer to its own static variable, it would just say self:<strong>Example:</strong> self::connection;

Question: Why doesn't "cd" work in a shell script?
Answer: Shell scripts are run inside a subshell, and each subshell has its own concept of what the current directory is. The <code>cd</code> succeeds, but as soon as the subshell exits, you're back in the interactive shell and nothing ever changed there. One way to get around this is to use an alias instead.

Here is a concise summary of the answer:

When iterating over arguments in a Bash script, use `"$@"` instead of `$*` to handle arguments with spaces correctly. The difference between them is that `"$@"` treats each argument as a separate item, while `$*` treats them as a single space-separated string. If you need to pass arguments with spaces to other commands, consider using non-standard tools or arrays to handle them correctly.

### Summary
When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the following issues:
- Lazy loaded objects are subclasses and may return false for getClass() comparison.
- Use getters instead of field references in equals() and hashCode() when dealing with Object-Relationship Mappers (ORMs) like Hibernate.
- Avoid using id fields in hashCode() to prevent hash code changes after object persistence.
- Use a non-changing subset of properties in hashCode() to ensure correct object equality checks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return <code>false</code>.

Git is a versioned filesystem platform with a built-in DVCS, offering flexibility and a wide range of non-source-control capabilities. Its complexity and flexibility make it more suitable for in-depth understanding, while Mercurial is a focused DVCS application.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Git is a platform, Mercurial is Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦Â¸ÂustÃ©Â?an application. Git is a versioned filesystem platform that happens to ship with a DVCS app in the box, but as normal for platform apps, it is more complex and has rougher edges than focused apps do. But this also means gitÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ VCS is immensely flexible, and there is a huge depth of non-source-control things you can do with git. If you try to use git without knowing whatÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ happening under the hood, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂl end up confused at some point (unless you stick to only very basic functionality).

if a method is not static, that "tells" the compiler that the method requires access to instance-level data in the class, (like a non-static field). This data would not be available unless an instance of the class has been created. If in fact the method does NOT reference any non-static member of the class, make the method static.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
At a theoretical level, binary semaphores and mutexes are equivalent, but in practice, they offer different services with distinct system-level implementations. Mutexes are designed as a lightweight synchronization mechanism, typically used for short periods of exclusive access to a resource, while semaphores are a data structure with a count and system call wrappers that interact with the scheduler, often used to block tasks until a resource is available.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The practical difference (in terms of the system services surrounding them) is that the implementation of a mutex is aimed at being a more lightweight synchronisation mechanism. A typical mutex implementation has a process or thread executing the test-and-set instruction and evaluating whether anything else had set the mutex. A semaphore is a synchronised data structure (typically using a mutex) that has a count and some system call wrappers that interact with the scheduler in a bit more depth than the mutex libraries would.

To create a summary of the given answer, I will focus on the main points and key information. Here's the summary:

Returning multiple values from a C++ function involves several approaches, including:

*   Using a struct or class instance if the values are related.
*   Refactoring the method into two if the values are unrelated.
*   Returning a pointer to a class instance or using reference parameters for large in-memory values.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It's entirely dependent upon the actual function and the meaning of the multiple values, and their sizes: <li>If they're related as in your fraction example, then I'd go with a struct or class instance. <li>If they're not really related and can't be grouped into a class/struct then perhaps you should refactor your method into two. <li>Depending upon the in-memory size of the values you're returning, you may want to return a pointer to a class instance or struct, or use reference parameters.

To determine if an integer's square root is an integer, check if it can be decomposed into a product of squares of prime numbers. This can be done by iterating over prime numbers, checking if their squares divide the input number, and dividing the number by the square if it does.

If every factor of the decomposition is even, then the number is a perfect square. First build a table of squares of prime numbers which are lower than 2^32. A solution would then be like this: BIGBLOCK Given nowadays' sqrt done in hardware and the need to compute prime numbers here, I guess this solution is way slower.

A System.OutOfMemoryException occurs when an application runs out of memory due to large datasets. This can be resolved by reducing the amount of data being processed, such as limiting the number of records returned, using data readers, or implementing data paging. If necessary, force .NET to free up memory by removing references to the dataset or clearing its rows.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Regardless of what the others have said, the error has nothing to do with forgetting to dispose your DBCommand or DBConnection, and you will not fix your error by disposing of either of them. Apparently your dataset consumes more than 50% of the available memory on your machine. Clearly, you'll run out of memory when you return another dataset of the same size before the first one has been garbage collected. You can remedy this problem in a few ways:

A proxy server acts on behalf of another computer, while a reverse proxy server acts on behalf of the server it is protecting. 

A forward proxy server is used by the client to access a blocked website, or to access a website when the client's IP address is blocked. 

A reverse proxy server, on the other hand, is used by the server to manage traffic and protect itself from direct access, often to distribute load and prevent abuse.

Extractive summary:
So, as before, we have data being retrieved by <code>Y --&gt; Z</code> on behalf of <code>X</code>, which chains as follows: <code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code>. What is different this time compared to a "forward proxy," is that this time the user <code>X</code> does not know he is accessing <code>Z</code>, because the user <code>X</code> only sees he is communicating with <code>Y</code>.

Ground truth:
What is different this time compared to a "forward proxy," is that this time the user <code>X</code> does not know he is accessing <code>Z</code>, because the user <code>X</code> only sees he is communicating with <code>Y</code>. The server <code>Z</code> is invisible to clients and only the reverse proxy <code>Y</code> is visible externally. A reverse proxy requires no (proxy) configuration on the client side.

Generated abstractive summary:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for data interchange, used for transmitting data between web services. It is a subset of JavaScript and consists of two structures: name/value pairs (objects) and ordered lists of values (arrays). JSON is preferred over XML due to its lightweight nature and is used in various languages, including JavaScript, where it is a string. To work with JSON in JavaScript, use the `JSON.parse()` method to convert a JSON string to an object and `JSON.stringify()` to convert an object to a JSON string.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript).

Question: What is the "continue" keyword and how does it work in Java?
Answer: The "continue" keyword in Java skips the current iteration and re-executes from the loop's condition or update expression, often used to avoid deeply-nested if statements or to escape nested loops.

Extractive summary:
It is often used to early-terminate a loop's processing and thereby avoid deeply-nested <code>if</code> statements.

Ground truth:
A <code>continue</code> statement without a label will re-execute from the condition the innermost <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> loop, and from the update expression of the innermost <code>for</code> loop. It is often used to early-terminate a loop's processing and thereby avoid deeply-nested <code>if</code> statements. Sometimes <code>continue</code> is also used as a placeholder in order to make an empty loop body more clear.

The fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer is achieved through a three-step approach:

1. Filter out obvious non-square numbers by checking for negative numbers, last 4 bits, and last 15 bits.
2. Check if the number is a square modulo 255 by using a precomputed table, reducing the number to a residue between 0 and 511.
3. If not a square modulo 255, use a modified Hensel's lemma to iteratively find the square root, dividing the number by powers of 2 and checking if the result is a square root.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I figured out a method that works ~35% faster than your 6bits+Carmack+sqrt code, at least with my CPU (x86) and programming language (C/C++). <li>First, filter out obvious answers. This includes negative numbers and looking at the last 4 bits. <li>Next, check if it's a square modulo 255 = 3 * 5 * 17. Because that's a product of three distinct primes, only about 1/8 of the residues mod 255 are squares. <li>Finally, try to compute the square root using a method similar to Hensel's lemma. Complete, tested code follows, including the precomputed tables. BIGBLOCK

Question: What's the difference between fill_parent and wrap_content?
Answer: 
Summary: Both fill_parent and wrap_content determine a View's or Layout's size based on its contents or parent layout, but they differ in how they expand: fill_parent (deprecated, now MATCH_PARENT) expands to fill available space, while wrap_content only expands to fit its contents.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It's used to set a View or Layouts size based on either it's contents or the size of it's parent layout rather than explicitly specifying a dimension. <strong><code>fill_parent</code></strong> (deprecated and renamed <code>MATCH_PARENT</code> in API Level 8 and higher) Setting the layout of a widget to fill_parent will force it to expand to take up as much space as is available within the layout element it's been placed in. Setting a top level layout or control to fill_parent will force it to take up the whole screen. <strong><code>wrap_content</code></strong> Setting a View's size to wrap_content will force it to expand only far enough to contain the values (or child controls) it contains. For layout elements it will resize the layout to fit the controls / layouts added as its children.

The "right" way to iterate through an array in Ruby is by using the enumerable mixin's each_slice method and the flatten method to avoid monkey-patching, but be cautious of potential issues with recursive arrays or hash values.

Extractive summary:

Generated abstractive summary:
Unsigned char is a type in C and C++ where all bits participate in determining its value and is explicitly unsigned. When converting an integer to unsigned char, the value is adjusted to fit within the new type's range by adding or subtracting the maximum value plus one until it falls within the range, rather than truncating higher-order bits.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object. Second, <code>unsigned char</code> is explicitly stated unsigned. If the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or   subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type   until the value is in the range of the new type.

Summary: time_t is a 32-bit or 64-bit signed integer type, depending on the platform.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It's a 32-bit signed integer type on most legacy platforms. However, that causes your code to suffer from the year 2038 bug. So modern C libraries should be defining it to be a signed 64-bit int instead, which is safe for a few billion years.

time_t is a data type in the ISO C library for storing system time values, defined in a standard header, but its underlying type is not specified in the C standard. It is typically implemented as a signed integer (32 or 64 bits) representing seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Such values are  returned from the standard <code>time()</code>  library function. <strong>ISO C defines  time_t as an arithmetic type, but does  not specify any particular type</strong>,  range, resolution, or encoding for it. Also unspecified are the meanings of  arithmetic operations applied to time  values. <strong>Unix and POSIX-compliant systems implement the <code>time_t</code> type as a <code>signed  integer</code> (typically 32 or 64 bits wide)  which represents the number of seconds  since the start of the Unix epoch</strong>:  midnight UTC of January 1, 1970 (not  counting leap seconds). Systems using a  32-bit <code>time_t</code> type are susceptible to  the Year 2038 problem.

Big O notation is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to complete as the size of the input increases, with O(1) indicating a constant time, O(N) indicating linear time, and other notations (like O(N^2)) indicating faster increasing time.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:

Extractive summary:
Apologies for any confusion caused. Each of these is an operation or a problem. One can notice that we've assumed the worst case scenario here. How? Something to think about. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time.

Ground truth:
Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: <strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> You can't compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers. But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful; Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

Java generics allow for compile-time type checking, but the type information is erased at runtime. To create a generic array, use the public `Stack(Class<T> clazz, int capacity)` constructor, which requires a `Class` object and allows the compiler to check that the type matches the specified type `T`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Java generics work by checking types at compile time and inserting appropriate casts, but <em>erasing</em> the types in the compiled files. This makes generic libraries usable by code which doesn't understand generics (which was a deliberate design decision) but which means you can't normally find out what the type is at run time. The public <code>Stack(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz,int capacity)</code> constructor requires you to pass a Class object at run time, which means class information <em>is</em> available at runtime to code that needs it. This then means that you can create an array object of the appropriate type in your constructor, which means that the type of the objects you store in your collection will have their types checked at the point they are added to the collection.

**"implements Runnable" vs. "extends Thread"**: Implementing `Runnable` is generally preferred over extending `Thread`, as it allows for loose coupling with concurrency choices and is more flexible. However, using raw `Threads` is discouraged, and `Callable` and `FutureTask` are recommended for their added features like timeouts and thread pooling.

Extractive summary:
In general, I would recommend using something like <code>Runnable</code> rather than <code>Thread</code> because it allows you to keep your work only loosely coupled with your choice of concurrency.

<strong>tl;dr: implements Runnable is better. In general, I would recommend using something like <code>Runnable</code> rather than <code>Thread</code> because it allows you to keep your work only loosely coupled with your choice of concurrency. <strong>Caveat:</strong> Around here, I strongly discourage the use of raw Threads.

Class is used to apply styles to a group of elements, while ID is used to apply styles to a single element.

Extractive summary:
Usually you use classes, but if there's a one-off you can use IDs (or just stick the style straight into the element).

Ground truth:
Class is for applying your style to a group of elements. ID styles apply to just the element with that ID (there should only be one). Usually you use classes, but if there's a one-off you can use IDs (or just stick the style straight into the element).

Here's a concise summary for the new example:

A `div id` uniquely identifies a single HTML element, while a `div class` applies a common style to multiple elements.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Any element can have a class or an id. A class is used to reference a certain type of display, for example you may have a css class for a div that represents the answer to this question. An id refers to only a single element, for example the related section at the right may have styling specific to it not reused elsewhere, it would use an id.

Generated abstractive summary:
In HTML, the difference between `div id` and `div class` is that `id` must be unique, while `class` can be applied to multiple elements. Use `id` for specific elements (e.g. `header`, `footer`) and `class` for similar elements (e.g. `highlight`, `external-link`).

Extractive summary:
<code>ids</code> must be unique where as <code>class</code> can be applied to many things.

Ground truth:
<code>ids</code> must be unique where as <code>class</code> can be applied to many things. In general, use <code>id</code> whenever you want to refer to a specific element and <code>class</code> when you have a number of things that are all alike. For instance, common <code>id</code> elements are things like <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>sidebar</code>. Common <code>class</code> elements are things like <code>highlight</code> or <code>external-link</code>.

Generated abstractive summary:
Classes are used to apply general styles or styles that can be applied across multiple elements, while IDs are unique identifiers used to apply styles to a specific element.

Extractive summary:
When I do JavaScript or CSS development, I typically use IDs to access/manipulate a very specific HTML element, and I use classes to access/apply styles to a broad range of elements.

Ground truth:
Classes are like categories. Classes are used to apply general styles or styles that can be applied across multiple HTML elements. IDs are identifiers. They're unique; no one else is allowed to have that same ID. IDs are used to apply unique styles to an HTML element.

The difference between `div id` and `div class` is like student ID cards: a unique `id` is like a distinct student ID, while a `class` is like a shared class title. A specific `id` takes precedence over a `class` in CSS selectors.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Perhaps an analogy will help understanding the difference: Student <strong>ID</strong> cards are distinct. No two students on campus will have the same student <strong>ID</strong> card. However, many students can and will share at least one <strong>Class</strong> with each other.

The JavaScript prototype is a chain of objects that an object looks for when it can't find a member. It can be accessed with the `__proto__` variable and is useful for inheritance, as it allows functions and variables to be stored in memory only once.

Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]], which is checked when a property is looked up and not found in the object. If not found, it walks the prototype chain until a match is found or reaches the end. The [[Prototype]] property can be accessed directly in some implementations, but it's only settable during object creation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Just think of constructor functions as classes and the properties of the prototype (ie of the object referenced by the constructor function's <code>prototype</code> property) as shared members, ie members which are the same for each instance.

To calculate the brightness of an RGB color, you must convert it to a linear color space, apply a weight average of the primary colors, and then adjust for display gamma.

Extractive summary:
All these equations work kinda well in practice, but if you need to be very precise you have to first convert the color to linear color space (apply inverse image-gamma), do the weight average of the primary colors and - if you want to display the color - take the luminance back into the monitor gamma.

Ground truth:
The luminance difference between ingnoring gamma and doing proper gamma is up to 20% in the dark grays.

To clone an array of objects in JavaScript, a multi-pass approach is required to handle circular references. This involves creating a clone of objects without references in the first pass, tracking their origins, and then linking them together in the second pass.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is nothing wrong with the way you cloned it...  the same result would occur using Array.slice(). The reason your deep copy is having problems is because you're ending up with circular object references. If you need a deep copy of an Array of Objects with circular references I believe you're going to have to code your own method to handle your specialized data structure, such that it is a multi-pass clone: <li>On round one, make a clone of all objects that don't reference other objects in the array. <li>On round two, link the objects together.

Generated abstractive summary:
To clone an Array of Objects in Javascript, a custom approach is needed due to cyclic graph issues, which can be solved by adding a copy count or a boolean flag to track copied objects and perform a second pass to reset references.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I'd do it with a variable <code>copyCount</code> which increases by 1 every time you copy in your code. An object that has a lower <code>copyCount</code> than the current copy-process is copied. If not, the copy, that exists already, should be referenced. This makes it necessary to link from the original to its copy. You'd have to make a second pass where you set all copy-references to Null.

Question: What is the difference between public, private, protected, and having no access modifier?
Answer: Those access modifiers specify where your members are visible, with public being accessible from anywhere, private within the same class, protected within the class and its derived classes, and no access modifier accessible from the same assembly.

Let me know if you would like me to summarize another example.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Those access modifiers specify where your members are visible. Static members are one per class and not one per instance.

Question: What is the difference between public, private, protected, and having no access modifier?
Summary: Access modifiers in C# include public (fully visible), private (visible only within the class), protected (visible within the class and its derived classes), and no access modifier (similar to private, with no explicit access).

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In a nutshell: Public gives the method or type complete visibility from other types/classes. Private allows only the type containing the private method/variable access to the private method/variable (note that nested classes  also have access to the containing classes private methods/variables). Protected is similar to private except derived classes can also access protected methods. "Nothing" is VB.NET's equivalent to null.

### Summary
Access modifiers in C# determine the scope of a type or member, controlling access from other code. The four main access modifiers are:
- **Public**: Accessible by all code.
- **Private**: Accessible only within the same class or struct.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same class, struct, or derived classes.
- **Internal**: Accessible within the same assembly but not from another assembly.
- **Protected Internal**: Accessible within the same assembly or derived classes in another assembly.
- **No Access Modifier**: Default access modifier, which is always present.
- **Static**: Applies to classes and members, meaning they can be accessed without an instance and have a single version, regardless of instances created.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>public</strong> The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it. <strong>private</strong> The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct. <strong>protected</strong> The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct, or in a derived class. <strong>internal</strong> The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly. <strong>protected internal</strong> The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, or by any derived class in another assembly. When <strong>no access modifier</strong> is set, a default access modifier is used.

The main differences between access modifiers in a class are:
- **public**: accessible by anyone, anywhere.
- **private**: only accessible within the class.
- **protected**: accessible within the class and by any inherited classes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>public</strong> - can be access by anyone anywhere. <strong>private</strong> - can only be accessed from with in the class it is a part of. <strong>protected</strong> - can only be accessed from with in the class or any object that inherits off of the class. Nothing is like null but in VB.

The difference between public, private, and protected access modifiers is related to good OOP design, allowing developers to hide internal workings and modify them later, with public for interface methods, private for internal members, and protected for methods to be overwritten.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If you are a developer of a library you want to hide the inner workings of your library. So you put your members and helper methods as private, and only interface methods are public. Methods that should be overwritten should be protected.

Public members are accessible from any class, private members are accessible only within the class itself, protected members are accessible within the class and its descendants, and there is no access modifier for members that are not accessible from anywhere.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Public</strong> - If you can see the class, then you can see the method <strong>Private</strong> - If you are <em>part of</em> the class, then you can see the method, otherwise not. <strong>Protected</strong> - Same as Private, plus all <em>descendants</em> can also see the method. <strong>Static (class)</strong> - Remember the distinction between "Class" and "Object" ? <strong>Static (method)</strong> - Whenever you use this method, it will have a frame of reference independent of the actual instance of the class it is part of.

The fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer is by using a bit array as a lookup table to eliminate possible squares, resulting in a 1/3 speed increase on a core2 duo machine.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The sqrt call is not perfectly accurate, as has been mentioned, but it's interesting and instructive that it doesn't blow away the other answers in terms of speed. So why is it slow? Because Java is actually calling a C routine through JNI, and it's actually slower to do so than to call a Java subroutine, which itself is slower than doing it inline. In C++, I suspect all the complex alternatives would lose on speed, but I haven't checked them all.What I did, and what Java people will find usefull, is a simple hack, an extension of the special case testing suggested by A. Rex.

To check if a program exists from a Bash script, use a POSIX-compatible method such as `hash`, `type`, or `command`. Avoid `which` due to its inconsistent behavior and potential system-specific issues. Instead, use one of the following alternatives: 

*   `hash`: returns the path of a command, hashes it for faster lookup, and exits with a status of 0 if the command exists, but has inconsistent exit codes in some POSIX shells.
*   `type`: returns the type of a command (builtin or executable) and exits with a status of 0 if the command exists, but has inconsistent exit codes in some POSIX shells.
*   `command`: returns the path of a command and exits with a status of 0 if the command exists, making it the safest option for checking command existence.

Project Euler problems often require checking numbers larger than 2^64, making standard optimizations impractical. To determine if an integer's square root is an integer, use a modified Newton's method with Java BigInteger.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I used java BigInteger and a slightly modified version of Newton's method, one that works better with integers. The problem was that exact squares n^2 converged to (n-1) instead of n because n^2-1 = (n-1)(n+1) and the final error was just one step below the final divisor and the algorithm terminated. It was easy to fix by adding one to the original argument before computing the error. A simple modification also lets you quickly calculate floor(sqrt(x)) instead of the closest integer.

To validate an XML file against an XSD file, use the JDK API for XML validation by calling 'Validator.validate(source, result)' with the source from your writer and result output. Alternatively, use Woodstox with XMLStreamWriter for Stax-based writing.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One more answer: since you said you need to validate files you are <strong>generating</strong> (writing), you might want to validate content while you are writing, instead of first writing, then reading back for validation. You can probably do that with JDK API for Xml validation, if you use SAX-based writer: if so, just link in validator by calling 'Validator.validate(source, result)', where source comes from your writer, and result is where output needs to go. Alternatively if you use Stax for writing content (or a library that uses or can use stax), Woodstox can also directly support validation when using XMLStreamWriter.

The "right" way to iterate through an array in Ruby is to use the `each` method with an optional index, i.e. `each |value, index|`, which is consistent with Ruby's focus on elements over indices. For hashes, it's common to iterate over keys and values in that order, either with `key => value` or `hash[key] = value`. The best approach depends on the programmer's preference and the project's requirements.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
As for the original question, "What is the __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through an array in Ruby? ", well, I think the core way (i.e. without powerful syntactic sugar or object oriented power) is to do: But Ruby is all about powerful syntactic sugar and object oriented power, but anyway here is the equivalent for hashes, and the keys can be ordered or not: So, my answer is, "The __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through an array in Ruby depends on you (i.e. the programmer or the programming team) and the project.".

The error "relation does not exist" in PostgreSQL is typically caused by referencing a table with a mixed-case spelling without proper delimiting, or by not including the schema in the table name.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One common reason is that the table is defined with a mixed-case spelling, and you're trying to query it with all lower-case. Use double-quotes to delimit identifiers so you can use the specific mixed-case spelling as the table is defined. Re your comment, you can add a schema to the "search_path" so that when you reference a table name without qualifying its schema, the query will match that table name by checked each schema in order. You can check your current schema search path: You can change your schema search path:

Question: ASP.NET Custom Validator Client side & Server Side validation not firing
Answer: Server-side validation won't fire if client-side validation is invalid. The issue is likely due to a mismatch between the specified client-side validation function name and the actual function name.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The client-side validation is not executed because you specified <code>ClientValidationFunction="TextBoxDTownCityClient"</code> and this will look for a function named <code>TextBoxDTownCityClient</code> as validation function, but the function name should be<code>TextBoxDAddress1Client</code>

Question: ASP.NET Custom Validator Client side & Server Side validation not firing
Answer: 
To ensure CustomValidator fires, you need a RequiredFieldValidator, or omit ControlToValidate and implement custom logic in validation functions.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your <code>CustomValidator</code> will only fire when the <code>TextBox</code> isn't empty. If you need to ensure that it's not empty then you'll need a <code>RequiredFieldValidator</code> too. Use a  RequiredFieldValidator control to  require the user to enter data in the  input control. If your <code>CustomValidator</code> specifies the <code>ControlToValidate</code> attribute (and your original example does) then your validation functions will only be called when the control isn't empty. If you don't specify <code>ControlToValidate</code> then your validation functions will be called every time. Rather than using a separate <code>RequiredFieldValidator</code>, you could omit the <code>ControlToValidate</code> attribute from the <code>CustomValidator</code> and setup your validation functions to do something like this:

Potential causes of "Could not establish trust relationship for SSL/TLS secure channel -- SOAP" issues include:

- DNS and network connectivity problems
- Incorrect server name or certificate
- Expired or invalid certificate
- Misconfigured load balancer
- Incorrect system clock or UTC time
- Certificate trust chain issues
- Incorrect proxy settings on the server

Ground truth:
<li>do you have DNS and line-of-sight to the server? <li>are you using the correct name from the certificate? <li>is the certificate still valid? <li>is a badly configured load balancer messing things up? <li>does the new server machine have the clock set correctly (i.e. so that the UTC time is correct [ignore local time, it is largely irrelevent]) - this certainly matters for WCF, so may impact regular SOAP? <li>is there a certificate trust chain issue? if you browse from the server to the soap service, can you get SSL? <li>related to the above - has the certificate been installed to the correct location?

The primary difference between `div id` and `div class` is that an ID can be used only once per page, while a class can be used multiple times. IDs are also useful for targeting specific elements with JavaScript or internal links, and can serve as a form of documentation within the document.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. In contrast, you must use a class to set up alternating row colors on a table, as they are by definition going to be used more than once. An element with an ID can be the target of a piece of JavaScript that manipulates the element or its contents in some way. Finally, if you make your IDs clear and logical, they can serve as a sort of Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦Â¸Âelf documentationÃ©Â?within the document.

Use interfaces when multiple classes need to respond to the same methods to be used interchangeably, prioritizing protocol over underlying logic.

Ground truth:
In my experience, interfaces are best  used when you have several classes  which each need to respond to the same  method or methods so that they can be  used interchangeably by other code  which will be written against those  classes' common interface. The best  use of an interface is when the  protocol is important but the  underlying logic may be different for  each class.

Objective-C method syntax allows for clear parameter specification by listing them in the method call, reducing ambiguity and error when passing multiple arguments. This is particularly useful for functions with many parameters and is due to Objective-C's lack of method overloading, which is instead achieved through variant method names.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Yes; the Objective-C method syntax is like this for a couple of reasons; one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying are. This also reduces ambiguity between the order of the method parameters, ensuring that you pass the object parameter first, <em>then</em> the index parameter. In a language such as C++, you would simply overload the number method to allow different data types to be passed as the argument; however, in Objective-C, this syntax allows several different variants of the same function to be implemented, by changing the name of the method for each variant of the function.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
You cannot return multiple values from a C# method directly. However, you have four options: 

1.  Return a structure (with pros and cons, as structs are value types and passed on the stack).
2.  Return an instance of a class (with design patterns to avoid modifying members).
3.  Use output parameters (with ref or out keywords, suitable for few parameters, but may limit agility).
4.  Return a dictionary or key-value pair (not recommended due to "secret knowledge" required for consumption).

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
There are three ways to return multiple values from a function in C#: 

1. Use `ref` parameters, which allow the function to modify the object in the calling code's stack.
2. Use `out` parameters, which are similar to `ref` parameters but require the function to set their value before returning.
3. Create a type that encapsulates both values and return that.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can use <code>ref</code> parameters: Another similar approach is to use an <code>out</code> parameter. The final approach (and the best in most cases) is to create a type that encapsulates both values and allow the function to return that:

### Summary
The key differences between an interface and an abstract class are: 

- Interfaces can't have concrete implementations, while abstract base classes can.
- More than one interface can be implemented on a class, but a class can only derive from a single abstract base class.
- Interfaces are less rigid, allowing for polymorphic hierarchy and pseudo-multi-inheritance, but changes to interfaces are breaking changes.
- Interfaces can be applied to value types (structs), while abstract base classes cannot.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Interfaces can't have any concrete implementations. Abstract base classes can. More than one interface can be implemented on a class. A class can only derive from a single abstract base class. Abstract base classes can be modified in v2+ without breaking the API. Changes to interfaces are breaking changes.

Summary: There is no clear distinction between interface and abstract class in Object-Oriented (OO) theory, but languages like C# and Java differentiate them through syntax and inheritance rules.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
For languages like C# and Java, there is a difference, but in other languages like C++ there is not. OO theory doesn't differentiate the two, merely the syntax of language. An abstract class is a class with both implementation and interface (pure virtual methods) that will be inherited. Interfaces generally do not have any implementation but only pure virtual functions.

Generated abstractive summary:
To create a concise summary, I will extract the key information from the answer and rephrase it in a clear and concise manner.

Summary: An interface and abstract class share similarities, but implementing an interface is not the same as inheriting from an abstract class. Interfaces allow for multiple inheritance, while abstract classes do not. Additionally, interfaces can define properties that must be implemented by the class implementing the interface.

Extractive summary:
When you inherit from this pure abstract class you are defining a hierarchy -> inheritance, if you implement the interface you are not, and you can implement as many interfaces as you want, but you can only inherit from one class.

Ground truth:
1) An interface can be seen as a pure Abstract Class, is the same, but despite this, is not the same to implement an interface and inheriting from an abstract class.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
In .NET, interfaces have no state or implementation and must be fully implemented by a class, while abstract classes can contain state and/or implementation, and can be inherited without implementing all abstract methods. Abstract classes and interfaces can be distinguished by their multiple inheritance capabilities.

Extractive summary:
In .NET (similar for Java):

Ground truth:
<li>interfaces can have no state or implementation <li>a class that implements an interface must provide an implementation of all the methods of that interface <li>abstract classes may contain state (data members) and/or implementation (methods) <li>abstract classes can be inherited without implementing the abstract methods (though such a derived class is abstract itself) <li>interfaces may be multiple-inherited, abstract classes may not (this is probably the key concrete reason for interfaces to exist separately from abtract classes - they permit an implementation of multiple inheritance that removes many of the problems of general MI). As general OO terms, the differences are not necessarily well-defined.

Access restriction on class due to restriction on required library rt.jar is not allowed under Java's license agreement, specifically for overriding classes in rt.jar.

Extractive summary:
"Applications that use this option for the purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed as doing  so would contravene the Java 2 Runtime Environment binary code license."

Ground truth:
My guess is that you are trying to replace a standard class which ships with Java 5 with one in a library you have. This is not allowed under the terms of the license agreement, however AFAIK it wasn't enforced until Java 5. I have seen this with QName before and I "fixed" it by removing the class from the jar I had. You may not modify the JavaPlatform Interface ("JPI", identified as classes containedwithin the "java" package or any subpackages of the "java"package), by creating additional classes within the JPI orotherwise causing the addition to or modification of theclasses in the JPI. In the event that you create anadditional class and associated API(s) which (i) extendsthe functionality of the Java platform, and (ii) is exposedto third party software developers for the purpose ofdeveloping additional software which invokes suchadditional API, you must promptly publish broadly anaccurate specification for such API for free use by alldevelopers.

Here's a concise summary:

The visibility of base class members in a derived class depends on the inheritance type: public (default), protected, or private, affecting how they are exposed to the derived class.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<li>public -> base class's public members will be public (usually the default)   <li>protected -> base class's public members will be protected    <li>private -> base class's public members will be private As litb points out, public inheritance is traditional inheritance that you'll see in most programming languages. Private inheritance, something AFAIK peculiar to C++, is an "IMPLEMENTED IN TERMS OF" relationship. That is you want to <strong>use</strong> the public interface in the derived class, but don't want the user of the derived class to have access to that interface.

There are three types of inheritance accessors: public, protected, and private. 

- Public inheritance: All classes aware of the parent class are also aware of the child class inheriting from it.
- Protected inheritance: Only the child class and its children are aware of the parent class inheritance.
- Private inheritance: Only the child class is aware of the parent class inheritance, and no other classes are aware of it.

Extractive summary:
<li>If the inheritance is <code>public</code>, everything that is aware of <code>Base</code> and <code>Child</code> is also aware that <code>Child</code> inherits from <code>Base</code>.

With public inheritance, the derived class can see public and protected members of the base. With private inheritance, it can't. With protected, the derived class and any classes derived from that can see them.

To pass a variable to the next page in PHP, you can use either a hidden form field, add it to the URL, or use sessions. However, be cautious when passing user-provided data, as it may be tampered with, and validate it for security.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Passing data in the request You could either embed it as a hidden field in your form, or add it your forms action URL Note this also illustrates the use of htmlentities and urlencode when passing data around. Passing data in the session Simply call session_start() at the start of each page, and you can get and set data into the $_SESSION array. Check it for validity! As you are clearly just getting started here, its worth reminding that this goes for any data which arrives in $_GET, $_POST or $_COOKIE - assume your worst enemy crafted the contents of those arrays, and code accordingly!

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
PHP allows passing variables to the next page through sessions, cookies, GET variables, or POST variables. Sessions are the most secure option, but require running `session_start();` on both pages. Cookies store data on the client, while GET and POST variables can be added to links or forms, but are less secure.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
HTML / HTTP is stateless, in other words, what you did / saw on the previous page, is completely unconnected with the current page. <em>Except</em> if you use something like sessions, cookies or GET / POST variables. Sessions and cookies are quite easy to use, with session being by far more secure than cookies. You can add the variable in the link to the next page: This will create a GET variable. Another way is to include a hidden field in a form that submits to page two: And then on page two: Just change the method for the form to <code>post</code> if you want to do it via post.

Python lambdas are useful for functional programming, allowing you to pass functions as arguments to other functions, making code shorter and more readable in various scenarios.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Python supports a style of programming called functional programming where you can pass functions to other functions to do stuff. (or even as <code>range(3,10,3)</code>), but there are many other, more sophisticated use cases where you can't use a list comprehension and a lambda function may be the shortest way to write something out.

Here is a concise summary of the provided answer:

Both Mercurial and Git are version control systems that use a series of snapshots (changesets) to represent history. However, they differ in their approach to modifying this history graph, with Git focusing on mutable history and Mercurial discouraging it but allowing it. Mercurial also has a bias towards non-destructive commands and has supported multiple branches since its inception, whereas Git treats multiple branches as diverged strands of development.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I work on Mercurial, but fundamentally I believe both systems are equivalent. Git has a strong focus on mutating this history graph (with all the consequences that entails) whereas Mercurial does not encourage history rewriting, but it's easy to do anyway and the consequences of doing so are exactly what you should expect them to be (that is, if I modify a changeset you already have, your client will see it as new if you pull from me). I chose Mercurial since it feels clean and elegant -- I was put off by the shell/Perl/Ruby scripts I got with Git. I like the blog post that compares Mercurial and Git with James Bond and MacGyver -- Mercurial is somehow more low-key than Git.

Question: SQL left join vs multiple tables on FROM line?
Answer: A left join can be achieved with either the join syntax or an expression in the WHERE clause, but the join syntax is more natural and syntactically preferred.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When you need an outer join the second syntax is <strong>not</strong> always required: I don't know the answer, but it is probably related to the fact that a <strong>join</strong> is more natural (syntactically, at least) than adding an expression to a <strong>where</strong> clause when you are doing exactly that: <strong>joining</strong>.

Ground truth:
The second is preferred because it is far less likely to result in an accidental cross join by forgetting to put inthe where clause. A join with no on clause will fail the syntax check, an old style join with no where clause will not fail, it will do a cross join.

### Example
Question: SQL left join vs multiple tables on FROM line?
Answer: Using multiple tables in the FROM clause with conditions in the WHERE clause can lead to cluttered and harder-to-read queries. It's recommended to use JOIN notation to improve readability and separate join criteria from result set restrictions.

Let's proceed with the next example. Please provide the question and answer.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Basically, when your FROM clause lists tables like so: BIGBLOCK the result is a cross product of all the rows in tables A, B, C. Then you apply the restriction <code>WHERE tableA.id = tableB.a_id</code> which will throw away a huge number of rows, then further ... <code>AND tableB.id = tableC.b_id</code> and you should then get only those rows you are really interested in. Using the JOIN notation makes the SQL statement <em>more</em> readable (IMHO, not using joins turns the statement into a mess). Using the cross product, you need to provide join criteria in the WHERE clause, and that's the problem with the notation. You should definitely use JOINs and keep the FROM clause a FROM clause, and the WHERE clause a WHERE clause.

Generated abstractive summary:
The old SQL syntax for left joins can be ambiguous and may not produce the desired results, especially when using multiple tables and joins. The new syntax, using the `FROM` clause to specify the join order, is less ambiguous and allows for more control over the join operations. This new syntax has been adopted by most modern databases, including Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and later, which have deprecated the old syntax.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The old syntax, with just listing the tables, and using the <code>WHERE</code> clause to specify the join criteria, is being deprecated in most modern databases. It's not just for show, the old syntax has the possibility of being ambiguous when you use both INNER and OUTER joins in the same query. So the old syntax is ambiguous. Enter the new syntax, with this you can choose. Additionally, the old way, by throwing a bunch of tables at the query optimizer, with a bunch of WHERE clauses, was akin to saying "here you are, do the best you can". With the new syntax, the query optimizer has less work to do in order to figure out what parts goes together.

To use a background image and color together, you can either make the image semi-transparent to allow the background color to show through, or use a separate div with the image or color applied and position it accordingly.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Make half of the image transparent so the background colour is seen through it. Else simply add another div taking up 50% up the container div and float it either left or right. Then apply either the image or the colour to it.

You can use both a color and an image as a background for an element by setting the `background-color` and `background-image` styles. If the image is smaller than the element, use `background-position` and `background-repeat` styles to position and prevent repetition. Alternatively, use the `background` composite style, but note that only the last style will be applied if used separately.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It's perfectly possible to use both a color and an image as background for an element. If the image is smaller than the element, you need to use the <code>background-position</code> style to place it to the right, and to keep it from repeating and covering the entire background you use the <code>background-repeat</code> style: BIGBLOCK Or using the composite style <code>background</code>: BIGBLOCK If you use the composite style <code>background</code> to set both separately, only the last one will be used, that's one possible reason why your color is not visible: BIGBLOCK

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
The Java compiler is requiring you to either catch or declare an exception because the method signature indicates it may throw a generic "Exception", which is too broad. It's recommended to declare a specific exception type instead. The issue is likely due to the cryptography package not being available, which is a checked exception. To resolve this, ensure the cryptography package is installed, and consider throwing a RuntimeException subclass instead, as it's more suitable for runtime errors.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The real problem is the "encrypt" method definition. No method should ever return "Exception", because it is too generic and may hide some other kinds of exception better is to have an specific exception. Try this:

Question: Why does Java have transient fields?
Answer: Java has the transient modifier to indicate fields that should not be persisted or serialized, such as those used for in-memory purposes only.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Serialization systems other than the native java one can also use this modifier. Hibernate, for instance, will not persist fields marked with either <strong>@Transient</strong> or the <strong>transient</strong> modifier.

Question: WhatÃÂ¨ÃÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ the difference between "Array()" and "[]" while declaring a JavaScript array?
Answer: The difference lies in the "Array()" method, which can create an array of a specified length when a number is passed to the constructor.

Here is the revised answer in a more concise format:
Summary: The difference between "Array()" and "[]" is that "Array()" can create an array of a specified length when a number is passed to the constructor.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is a difference, but there is no difference in that example. Using the more verbose method: <code>new Array()</code> does have one extra option in the parameters: if you pass a number to the constructor, you will get an array of that length:

Here is a concise summary of the answer:

An application server and web server are both machines that listen for requests from clients, but a web server specifically listens on a TCP/IP channel using internet protocols like HTTP, FTP, etc., and typically serves web pages, while an application server can provide various services and respond to requests in different ways.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
An application server is a machine (an executable process running on some machine, actually) that "listens" (on any channel, using any protocol), for requests from clients for whatever service it provides, and then does something based on those requests. A Web server is process running on a machine that "listens" specifically on TCP/IP Channel using one of the "internet" protocols, (http, https, ftp, etc..)  and does whatever it does based on those incoming requests... Generally, (as origianly defined), it fetched/generated and returned an html web page to the client, either fetched from a static html file on the server, or constructed dynamically based on parameters in the incoming client request.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

The key differences between an application server and a web server are:
- Web servers primarily serve HTTP content, while application servers can support multiple protocols.
- Web servers are designed for static content, whereas application servers support dynamic content and application-level services like connection pooling and transaction support.
- Application servers often have a web server component, allowing them to serve static content as well.
- In production environments, web servers often act as reverse proxies to application servers, serving static content and forwarding dynamic requests.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Most of the times these terms Web Server and Application server are used interchangeably. <li>Web Server is designed to serve HTTP Content. App Server can also serve HTTP Content but is not limited to just HTTP. <li>Web Server is mostly designed to serve static content, though most Web Servers have plugins to support scripting languages like Perl, PHP, ASP, JSP etc. through which these servers can generate dynamic HTTP content. <li>Most of the application servers have Web Server as integral part of them, that means App Server can do whatever Web Server is capable of. <li>As web servers are well suited for static content and app servers for dynamic content, most of the production environments have web server acting as reverse proxy to app server.

Web servers serve content via HTTP, while application servers host and expose business logic and processes, often with the web server acting as the front-end interface.

Extractive summary:
That said, in many scenarios you will find that the web server is being used to create the front-end of the application server, that is, it exposes a set of web pages that allow the user to interact with the business rules found into the application server.

Ground truth:
Both terms are very generic, one containing the other one and vice versa in some cases. <li><strong>Web server</strong>: serves content to the web using http protocol. <li><strong>Application server</strong>: hosts and exposes business logic and processes.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
The distinction between an application server and a web server has historically been blurry, and the terms are often used differently depending on the context. Traditionally, a web server served HTTP content, while an application server handled enterprise features, transactions, and multi-channel communication. However, modern web servers have become more sophisticated and can handle heavy loads and concurrency, while application servers often include HTTP-based communication capabilities. Today, the terms are often used interchangeably, with some products, such as WebSphere and WebLogic, bundling both web and application server capabilities.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Historically, they were different, but through the 90's these two previously distinct categories blended features and effectively merged. At this point is is probably best to imagine that the "App Server" product category is a strict superset of the "web server" category. Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads, more concurrency, and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability. When someone says "web server" you often think HTTP-centric, web UI, oriented apps. When someone says "App server" you may think "heavier loads, enterprise features, transactions and queuing, multi-channel communication (HTTP + more).

Java 256-bit AES Password-Based Encryption

To derive a 256-bit key from a password and salt, use a key derivation function with 65536 iterations and the password, salt, and magic numbers. The derived key can be used for encryption in CBC mode, but AEAD modes like GCM are recommended for better security. Store the ciphertext and initialization vector (IV) separately. On decryption, regenerate the key and use it with the stored IV to decrypt the message.

The error "The ConnectionString property has not been initialized" occurs when a data source cannot find the connection string. This is often due to a missing or incorrectly assigned connection string, typically in the web.config file or through programmatic assignment.

Ground truth:
You get this error when a datasource attempts to bind to data but cannot because it cannot find the connection string. If you are programmatically assigning a datasource (such as a SqlDataSource) or creating a query (i.e. using a SqlConnection/SqlCommand combination), make sure you assigned it a ConnectionString. If you are hooking up a databound element to a datasource (i.e. a GridView or ComboBox to a SqlDataSource), make sure the datasource is assigned to one of your connection strings. Try replacing that with <code>ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ConnectionString"].ConnectionString</code> (if ConnectionString is the name of your connection string.)

Reactive programming is a paradigm where a program is viewed as a directed graph of nodes, each performing simple computations, connected by links that provide outputs to inputs. It's similar to dataflow computing but with external stimuli triggering nodes to perform computations, leading to cascades of execution. This approach is well-suited for UI design and situations where asynchronous computation works better than clock-governed execution.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external "stimuli" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs "triggered" or "marked". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Reactive programming imports this "cascade of execution" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the "outside world" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs "reacts" to them. Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.

Functional reactive programming is a combination of functional programming and reactive programming that allows computations to automatically update when their inputs change, without the need for variable mutations.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One way to get side-effect like behavior while still retaining a functional style is to use functional reactive programming. This is the combination of functional programming, and reactive programming. The basic idea behind reactive programming is that there are certain datatypes that represent a value "over time". This is why reactive programming and functional programming work so well together: reactive programming removes the need to mutate variables while still letting you do a lot of what you could accomplish with variable mutations.

Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a paradigm that captures dynamic values over time as first-class values, allowing for direct representation and manipulation of continuous and evolving values. It differs from conventional imperative programming by providing a fine-grained, determinate, and continuous concurrency model, making it easier to reason about complex systems. FRP can be understood by considering behaviors as functions of continuous time, built from primitives such as constant and time behaviors, combined using point-wise operations, and accounting for discrete phenomena with events and their associated streams of occurrences.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
So, what is FRP?You could have invented it yourself.Start with these ideas: <li>Dynamic/evolving values (i.e., values "over time") are first class values in themselves. <li>Behaviors are built up out of a few primitives, like constant (static) behaviors and time (like a clock), and then with sequential and parallel combination. <li>To account for discrete phenomena, have another type (family) of "events", each of which has a stream (finite or infinite) of occurrences. <li>To come up with the compositional vocabulary out of which all behaviors and events can be built, play with some examples. <li>So that you know you're on solid ground, give the whole model a compositional foundation, using the technique of denotational semantics, which just means that (a) each type has a corresponding simple &amp; precise mathematical type of "meanings", and (b) each primitive and operator has a simple &amp; precise meaning as a function of the meanings of the constituents.<em>Never, ever</em> mix implementation considerations into your exploration process. If you stick with these principles, I expect you'll get something more-or-less in the spirit of FRP. It's been quite a challenge to implement this model correctly and efficiently, but that's another story.

Polymorphism is a design concept where objects of a superclass can be treated as objects of a subclass, allowing for different implementations of a common interface. It enables objects to behave differently based on their specific class type, similar to how musicians can interpret a musical script in their own unique way.

Question: What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?
Answer: In Object Oriented languages, polymorphism allows treatment and handling of different data types through the same interface.

Summary: Polymorphism in Object Oriented languages allows handling different data types through a single interface.

Extractive summary:
In Object Oriented languages, polymorphism allows treatment and handling of different data types through the same interface. For example, consider inheritance in C++: Class B is derived from Class A. A pointer of type A* (pointer to class A) may be used to handle both an object of class A AND an object of class B.

Ground truth:
In Object Oriented languages, polymorphism allows treatment and handling of different data types through the same interface.

### Example
Question: What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?
Answer: 
Summary: Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types), allowing the same operations to be applied to different data types. It is achieved by making a class responsible for its own code and data, enabling the creation of classes with their own unique characteristics, such as Shape classes (square, circle, polygon) that can be treated uniformly.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. By making the class responsible for its code as well as its data, you can achieve polymorphism.

Extractive summary:
Polymorphism is the ability of the programmer to write methods of the same name that do different things for different types of objects, depending on the needs of those objects. At least in dynamically-typed languages like PHP (I don't know about C++ or Java), polymorphism allows the developer to call a method without necessarily knowing the type of object ahead of time, and trusting that the correct implementation of the method will be called.

Generated abstractive summary:
The extern "C" keyword in C++ specifies that a function or variable should have 'C' linkage, meaning its name is not mangled by the C++ compiler, allowing it to be used by C code. This is necessary because C++ function names are mangled due to overloading, while C does not support overloading.

Extractive summary:
extern "C" makes a function-name in C++ have 'C' linkage (compiler does not mangle the name) so that client C code can link to (i.e use) your function using a 'C' compatible header file that contains just the declaration of your function.

Ground truth:
extern "C" makes a function-name in C++ have 'C' linkage (compiler does not mangle the name) so that client C code can link to (i.e use) your function using a 'C' compatible header file that contains just the declaration of your function. Since C++ has overloading of function names and C does not, the C++ compiler cannot just use the function name as a unique id to link to, so it mangles the name by adding information about the arguments. If you care about the technicalities, they are listed in section 7.5 of the C++03 standard, here is a brief summary (with emphasis on extern "C"): <li>extern "C" is a linkage-specification <li>Every compiler is <em>required</em> to provide "C" linkage <li>a linkage specification shall occur only in namespace scope <li> all function types, function names and variable names have a language linkage  See Richard's Comment: Only function names and variable names with external linkage have a language linkage <li>two function types with distinct language linkages are distinct types even if otherwise identical <li>linkage specs nest, inner one determines the final linkage <li>extern "C" is ignored for class members <li>at most one function with a particular name can have "C" linkage (regardless of namespace) <li> extern "C" forces a function to have external linkage (cannot make it static)   See Richard's comment:    'static' inside 'extern "C"' is valid; an entity so declared has internal linkage, and so does not have a language linkage <li>Linkage from C++ to objects defined in other languages and to objects defined in C++ from other languages is implementation-defined and language-dependent.

Because C++ allows overloading and has many features that C does not Ã©Â?like classes, member functions, exception specifications - it is not possible to simply use the function name as the symbol name.

To get the index of the current iteration of a foreach loop, use the foreach loop itself, which automatically calls the Dispose method and closes the reader, preventing connection leaks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>foreach</code> is a useful construct, and not replaceble by a <code>for</code> loop in all circumstances. This is therefore safer as it prevents connection leaks even if you forget to close the reader.

Question: Object comparison in JavaScript
Answer: 

Summary: Object comparison in JavaScript is difficult due to issues with whitespace, synonym methods, and methods producing the same result with different implementations.

Extractive summary:
Note that testing methods with toString() is <em>absolutely not good enough</em> but a method which would be acceptable is very hard because of the problem of whitespace having meaning or not, never mind synonym methods and methods producing the same result with different implementations.

Ground truth:
Certainly not the only way - you could prototype a method (against Object here but I certainly wouldn't suggest using Object for live code) to replicate C#/Java style comparison methods.

Generated abstractive summary:
The Hibernate error "org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException" occurs when two objects with the same identifier value are associated with the session, but they are not the same object. This can happen due to cascading saves, incorrect primary key generator, or persisting an object that is already associated with the session. It can be resolved by checking if the primary key of an object has been updated or removed and then trying to insert the same object again.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would suggest you break down your code, i.e. comment out bits until the error goes away and then put the code back until it comes back and you should find the error it. The reason I ask is this error is related to how you're telling hibernate to ascertain the persistent state of an object (i.e. whether an object is persistent or not). The error could be happening because hibernate is trying to persist and object that is already persistent.

If the answer was something like: You can use a `System.Timers.Timer` in C# to run certain code every n seconds. Here is an example of how to do it:

```csharp
System.Timers.Timer timer = new System.Timers.Timer(1000); // 1000 milliseconds = 1 second
timer.Elapsed += (sender, e) => { /* code to run every second */ };
timer.Start();
```

The Clockwise/Spiral Rule can be used to interpret pointer declarations in C++. This rule states that when reading a declaration from left to right, the first word is the type, the second word is the pointer, and the remaining words are the declarators. 

The order of declarators is as follows:
- The first declarator is the pointer itself.
- The second declarator is the const qualifier, which means the pointer is constant and cannot be changed.
- The third declarator is the type, which is the type of the variable being pointed to.

Examples of pointer declarations include:
- int*: a pointer to an integer
- int const*: a pointer to a constant integer
- int* const: a constant pointer to an integer
- int const* const: a constant pointer to a constant integer

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>int*</code> - pointer to int <code>int const *</code> - pointer to const int <code>int * const</code> - const pointer to int <code>int const * const</code> - const pointer to const int

Question: What is the difference between const int*, const int * const, and int const *?
Answer: The main difference lies in the placement of the 'const' keyword in pointer declarations. 'const int*' means a pointer to a constant integer, 'int * const' means a constant pointer to an integer, and 'int const *' is an alternative syntax for the same.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The simplest use is to declare a named constant. It also works with pointers but one has to be careful where __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________const__________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ to determine whether the pointer or what it points to is constant or both. Basically __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________const__________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ applies to whatever is on its immediate left (other than if there is nothing there in which case it applies to whatever is its immediate right).

To summarize the given answer:

When reading pointer declarations from right-to-left, the differences between const int*, const int * const, and int const * are: 
- const int* p means the object pointed to is constant.
- int * const p means the pointer itself is constant.
- const int * const p means both the pointer and the object are constant.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>const X* p</code> means "p points to an X that is const": the X object can't be changed via p. <code>X* const p</code> means "p is a const pointer to an X that is non-const": you can't change the pointer p itself, but you can change the X object via p. <code>const X* const p</code> means "p is a const pointer to an X that is const": you can't change the pointer p itself, nor can you change the X object via p.

### Example
Question: What is the difference between const int*, const int * const, and int const *?
Answer: I think everything is answered here already, but I just want to add that you should beware of <code>typedef</code>s! They're NOT just text replacements. For example: The type of <code>astring</code> is <code>char * const</code>, not <code>const char *</code>. This is one reason I always tend to put <code>const</code> to the right of the type, and never at the start.

Summary: The difference between const int*, const int * const, and int const * is that the placement of 'const' affects the constness of the pointer versus the data it points to.

To summarize the answer: The placement of "const" in pointer declarations can be confusing, but a simpler approach is to place it after the thing it applies to. This means "int const *" means the int is constant, while "int * const" means the pointer is constant.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In short, I find the easiest way to remember the rule is that the "const" goes after the thing it applies to. So in your question, "int const *" means that the int is constant, while "int * const" would mean that the pointer is constant.

Object comparison in JavaScript can be achieved through two methods.

The 'System.OutOfMemoryException' exception does not necessarily mean there's insufficient physical memory. It occurs when there's no contiguous portion of memory available to satisfy the allocation request, even with available memory blocks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In short, and very simplified, "Out of memory" does not really mean that the amount of available memory is too small. The most common reason is that within the current address space, there is no contiguous portion of memory that is large enough to serve the wanted allocation.

The best approach to remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server is to use a User Defined Function (UDF) in SQL Server 2005 and lower, but avoid using it in WHERE clauses for performance reasons. For SQL Server 2008 and higher, it's recommended to separate dates and times natively, as the database engine can efficiently query these independently.

Extractive summary:
I, personally, almost always use User Defined functions for this if dealing with SQL Server 2005 (or lower version), however, it should be noted that there are specific drawbacks to using UDF's, especially if applying them to WHERE clauses (see below and the comments on this answer for further details).

Ground truth:
I, personally, almost always use User Defined functions for this if dealing with SQL Server 2005 (or lower version), however, it should be noted that there are specific drawbacks to using UDF's, especially if applying them to WHERE clauses (see below and the comments on this answer for further details). If using SQL Server 2008 (or higher) - see below. If using a UDF, it should be noted that you should try to avoid using the UDF as part of a WHERE clause in a query as this will greatly hinder performance of the query. The main reason for this is that using a UDF in a WHERE clause renders that clause as non-sargable, which means that SQL Server can no longer use an index with that clause in order to improve the speed of query execution. Of course, the absolute <em>best</em> approach for this is to use SQL Server 2008 (or higher) and separate out your dates and times, as the SQL Server database engine is then natively providing the individual date and time components, and can efficiently query these independently without the need for a UDF or other mechanism to extract either the date or time part from a composite datetime type.

To remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server, use the DATEADD/DATEDIFF method for SQL Server versions prior to 2008, and CAST to date or the date data type for SQL Server 2008 and later.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Strictly, method <code>a</code> is the least resource intensive: Proven less CPU intensive for same total duration a million rows by some one with way too much time on their hands: Most efficient way in SQL Server to get date from date+time? I prefer the DATEADD/DATEDIFF because: <li>varchar is subject to language/dateformat issues <li>float relies on internal storage <li>it extends to work out first day of month, tomorrow etc by changing "0" base For SQL Server 2008+, you can CAST to <code>date</code>. Or just use <code>date</code> so no time to remove.

### Example
Question: How to implement a Singleton design pattern in Python?
Answer: The Singleton design pattern restricts a class from instantiating multiple objects. It can be implemented in Python by defining a class with a private constructor and a static method that returns the instance of the class. The instance is stored in a private static variable, and the method checks if an instance exists before creating a new one. This approach ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the application's lifetime.
Summary: The Singleton pattern in Python is implemented by creating a class with a private constructor and a static method that returns the single instance of the class, stored in a private static variable.

Extractive summary:
The keyword self does <strong>NOT</strong> refer merely to the 'current class', at least not in a way that restricts you to static members. Within the context of a non-static member, <code>self</code> also provides a way of bypassing the vtable (see wiki on vtable) for the current object. Just as you can use <code>parent::methodName()</code> to call the parents version of a function, so you can call <code>self::methodName()</code> to call the current classes implementation of a method. This will output: Hello, I'm Ludwig the geek Goodbye from Ludwig the person In both cases, we are dealing with the method of an instantiated object, and have access to the <code>$this</code> pointer within the called functions.

Asking for the difference between two commits without including the commits in-between doesn't make sense, as commits are snapshots of the repository. The question may be trying to ask for the delta of a single commit rebased on top of another, or the differences between two commits, which can be achieved by comparing the commits directly.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
As William suggested, cherry-picking can give you the delta of a single commit rebased on top of another. That is: If you're just interested in abcdef itself, you can do: And of course gives you all differences between those two commits.

A clustered index physically stores data with similar values close together on the disk, improving retrieval of records within a specific range. A non-clustered index points to the location of data in the clustered index.

Extractive summary:
This way the records with the same CustomerID will be physically stored close to each other on disk (clustered) which speeds up their retrieval.

Ground truth:
A clustered index means you are telling the database to store close values actually close to one another on the disk. This has the benefit of rapid scan / retrieval of records falling into some range of clustered index values.

With a Clustered index, rows are stored in the same order as the index on disk, allowing for only one index per table. In contrast, a Non-clustered index stores pointers to rows, allowing for multiple indexes but potentially slower write performance.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index. Therefore, there can be only one clustered index. With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows. You can have many non clustered indexes, although each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records. It is generally faster to read from a clustered index if you want to get back all the columns.

Clustered and non-clustered indexes differ in their physical data organization on disk, with clustered indexes sorting data and non-clustered indexes being used for primary keys or foreign keys.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A very simple, non-technical rule-of-thumb would be that clustered indexes are usually used for your primary key (or, at least, a unique column) and that non-clustered are used for other situations (maybe a foreign key).

Here is a concise summary of the given answer:

C++ offers four types of casts: const_cast, static_cast, dynamic_cast, and reinterpret_cast. 
- const_cast is used to add or remove const or volatile properties.
- static_cast is used for casting between integer types and casting pointers to related types.
- dynamic_cast is used for casting at runtime, particularly for inheritance, and returns NULL or throws an exception if the cast fails.
- reinterpret_cast is used for bitwise casting, allowing for potential misuse by casting any pointer or integral type to any other type.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types. Static cast is also used to cast pointers to related types, for  example casting void* to the appropriate type. Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy).

You cannot run PHP code directly when a user clicks on a link without leaving the page, but you can use AJAX to send a page request to the server and execute PHP code, then parse the response in the browser.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You cant run PHP when a user clicks on a link without leaving the page unless you use AJAX. PHP is a serverside scripting language, meaning the second that the browser sees the page, there is no PHP in it. In an AJAX Solution, basically the page uses javascript to send a page request to another page on your domain. Javascript then gets whatever you decide to <code>echo</code> in the response, and it can parse it and do what it wants from there.

Summary: Public inheritance allows polymorphic use by all classes, protected inheritance allows polymorphic use by child classes, and private inheritance allows only the derived class to use parent class methods.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If you inherit publicly from another class, everybody knows you are inheriting and you can be used polymorphically by anyone through a base class pointer. If you inherit protectedly only your children classes will be able to use you polymorphically. If you inherit privately only yourself will be able to execute parent class methods.

Here's a summary of the given answer:

Public inheritance models an "IS-A" relationship, where a subclass is a type of its superclass. Private inheritance models an "IS-IMPLEMENTED-USING" relationship, where a subclass uses its superclass in its implementation, but is not a type of it. Protected inheritance is unclear and its purpose is unknown.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Public inheritance models an IS-A relationship. Private inheritance models an IS-IMPLEMENTED-USING relationship (or whatever that's called). Private inheritance can always be eliminated by using containment instead:

Inheritance in C++ can be categorized into three types: private, protected, and public.

- **Private Inheritance**: Used for implementation, not for inheritance. Only accessible within the class itself and its friends.
- **Protected Inheritance**: Used for providing enhanced access to derived classes. Only accessible within the class itself, its friends, and derived classes.
- **Public Inheritance**: Used for IS-A relationships, where a derived class can replace the base class.

A "connection reset by peer" error occurs when a TCP connection is closed due to a packet with the RST (reset) bit set, typically caused by the other end crashing or closing the connection while data is in transit.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This means that a TCP RST was received and the connection is now closed. This occurs when a packet is sent from your end of the connection but the other end does not recognize the connection; it will send back a packet with the RST bit set in order to forcibly close the connection. This can happen if the other side crashes and then comes back up or if it calls <code>close()</code> on the socket while there is data from you in transit, and is an indication to you that some of the data that you previously sent may not have been received.

Generated abstractive summary:
To write a long long integer constant in C/C++, a suffix LL is required, e.g., 100000000000LL.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You need to use a suffix to change the type of the literal, i.e. The suffix <code>LL</code> makes the literal into type <code>long long</code>. C is not "smart" enough to conclude this from the type on the left, the type is a property of the literal itself, not the context in which it is being used.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
The type "long long" in C/C++ depends on the compilation mode, with explicit "LL" suffix required for long long extension support, except in the next C++ version where it will be supported without suffix unless explicitly forced.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
long long is not part of the C++ standard but only (usually) supported as extension. If the number is even too big for long the result is implementation-defined (probably just a number of type long int that has been truncated for backward compatibility). In this case you have to explicitly use the LL suffix to enable the long long extension (on most compilers). If the number cannot be represented in long the compiler will automatically try to use long long even without LL suffix.

The solution is to be explicit about the character encoding when converting byte arrays to strings and vice versa, using a String constructor and toByteArray method with an explicit charset, such as UTF-8 or Latin-1, or using a binary encoding like Base64 for binary data.

Ground truth:
The root problem is (I think) that you are unwittingly using a character set for which: Be explicit about the character encoding you are using; i.e. Use the right character set for your byte data ... or alternatively one (such as "Latin-1" where all byte sequences map to valid Unicode characters. If your bytes are (really) binary data and you want to be able to transmit / receive them over a "text based" channel, use something like Base64 encoding ... which is designed for this purpose.

To convert a byte array to a string and vice versa, use a specified encoding to ensure accuracy, as strings are for text and byte arrays are for binary data. If conversion is necessary, use Base64 encoding for binary data in a string.

Extractive summary:
If you really must use a <code>String</code> to hold binary data then the safest way is to use Base64 encoding.

Ground truth:
<code>String</code>s are for text, <code>byte[]</code> is for binary data, and the only really sensible thing to do is to avoid converting between them unless you absolutely have to. If you really must use a <code>String</code> to hold binary data then the safest way is to use Base64 encoding.

Question: IllegalMonitorStateException on wait() call
Answer: You need to be in a <code>synchronized</code> block in order for <code>Object.wait()</code> to work. Also, I recommend looking at the concurrency packages instead of the old school threading packages. They are safer and way easier to work with. Happy coding. EDIT I assumed you meant <code>Object.wait()</code> as your exception is what happens when you try to gain access without holding the objects lock.

Summary: To resolve IllegalMonitorStateException on a wait() call, you need to be in a synchronized block. Consider using concurrency packages for safer and easier multithreading.

Generated abstractive summary:
A thread can only wait if it's synchronized on the object it's waiting on, and attempting to wait on an unsynchronized object results in an IllegalMonitorStateException.

Extractive summary:
<code>java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException</code> means you are trying to wait on object on which you are not synchronized - it's illegal to do so.

Ground truth:
If you want to wait for some condition, you need a lock object - Thread.class object is a very bad choice - it is a singleton AFAIK so synchronizing on it (except for Thread static methods) is dangerous.

Answer: Many years ago, to provide an age calculator gimmick on my website, I...
==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Based on the provided answer, here's a concise summary:

The `IllegalMonitorStateException` occurs when calling `obj.wait()` because the current thread does not hold the mutex for `obj`. Additionally, `thread.wait()` causes the current thread to wait, not the nominated thread, and there's no safe way to force a thread to pause; instead, use a `CountDownLatch` for thread synchronization.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
First, as others have said, <code>obj.wait()</code> can only be called if the current thread holds the primitive mutex for <code>obj</code>. The second (more important) problem is that <code>thread.wait()</code> does not do what you seem to be expecting it to do.

- Focused on the main point of the answer: the difference between type() and isinstance()
- Included the key benefit of using isinstance(), which is handling subclasses properly
- Added the additional feature of isinstance() allowing a tuple of types to be checked.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The latter is preferred, because it will handle subclasses properly.

Question: What are the differences between type() and isinstance()?
Answer: The key difference is that `isinstance()` returns `True` for subclasses, whereas `type()` does not.

Here is the summary:

`isinstance()` is better than `type()` because it returns `True` for subclasses, making it a more versatile option.

Summary: In Python, `isinstance()` is preferred over `type()` due to Python 2.2 changes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Starting in Python 2.2, built-in  factory functions such as <code>int()</code> and  <code>str()</code> are also names for the  corresponding types. So <code>isinstance()</code> should be preferred over <code>type()</code>.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Type() and isinstance() have different uses in Python. isinstance() checks if an object is an instance of a class, including its subclasses, while type() checks for exact identity of types. In Python, isinstance() is generally preferred over type() because it supports inheritance, making it a better choice for duck typing. However, a more Pythonic solution is to use try-except blocks to check if an object behaves like a certain type.

Extractive summary:
answers, <code>isinstance</code> caters for inheritance (an instance of a derived class <em>is an</em> instance of a base class, too), while checking for equality of <code>type</code> does not (it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes, AKA subclasses). The normal, Pythonic, preferred solution is almost invariably "duck typing": try using the argument <em>as if</em> it was of a certain desired type, do it in a <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> statement catching all exceptions that could arise if the argument was not in fact of that type (or any other type nicely duck-mimicking it;-), and in the <code>except</code> clause, try something else (using the argument "as if" it was of some other type).

Ground truth:
To summarize the contents of other (already good!) answers, <code>isinstance</code> caters for inheritance (an instance of a derived class <em>is an</em> instance of a base class, too), while checking for equality of <code>type</code> does not (it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes, AKA subclasses). For the purpose of this answer, the key thing to retain about ABCs (beyond an arguably more natural placement for TM DP functionality, compared to the classic Python alternative of mixin classes such as UserDict.DictMixin) is that they make <code>isinstance</code> (and <code>issubclass</code>) much more attractive and pervasive (in Python 2.6 and going forward) than they used to be (in 2.5 and before), and therefore, by contrast, make checking type equality an even worse practice in recent Python versions than it already used to be.

The heap size in Java can be increased up to 75% of the physical memory, but doing so may not be advisable if the system is already running low on memory.

Ground truth:
Yes you can. In fact, you can increase to more than the amount of physical memory, if you want to. In particular, if the "working set" of the applications and services that are currently running significantly exceeds the available physical memory, your system is liable to "thrash", spending a lot of time moving virtual memory pages to and from disk.

It's commonly used during debugging to make the program fail more obviously if an unexpected condition occurs. The corollary of this is that your program should <em>never</em> rely on the assert macro running. From the combination of the program calling abort() and not being guaranteed to do anything, asserts should only be used to test things that the developer has assumed rather than, for example, the user entering a number rather than a letter (which should be handled by other means).

The "assert" function halts program execution if its value is false, used for testing assumptions in a program.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It is a function that will halt program execution if the value it has evaluated is false. It is designed to be used for testing the assumptions you have made. The ideal you want is that you can make an error in your program, like calling a function with invalid arguments, and you hit an assert before it segfaults (or fails to work as expected)

To configure Git over SSH to login once, run `ssh-agent` in the background and then use `ssh-add` to load your private key with a passphrase. This will allow SSH-family commands to use your private key automatically.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Try <code>ssh-add</code>, you need <code>ssh-agent</code> to be running and holding your private key Once you log in, the idea is to run <code>ssh-add</code> once and only once, in order to give the agent your passphrase, to decode your key. On OSX (err, <em>macOS</em>), GNOME and KDE systems, <code>ssh-agent</code> is usually launched automatically for you. I will go through the details in case, like me, you also have a Cygwin or other windows environment where this most certainly is not done for you. There are various ways to automatically run the agent. As the man page explains, you can run it so that it is a parent of all your login session's other processes. Alternatively, you can run the agent as an ordinary child, save the environment settings in a file, and source that file in every shell when it starts. My Cygwin system needed it done manually, so I did this in my <code>.profile</code> and I have <code>.bashrc</code> source <code>.profile</code>: BIGBLOCK You can also just run <code>ssh-add</code> and if it fails start an agent.1.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
To configure Git over SSH to login once, you can use certificates or ssh-agent. With certificates, you enter a private key password instead of an account password. With ssh-agent, you can load your passphrase once and use it for all subsequent ssh-family commands, but it requires restarting the agent on each new shell. Alternatively, you can use keychain or Gnome Keyring for system-wide secure storage of your certificate's password.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I think there are two different things here. The first one is that normal SSH authentication requires the user to put the account's password (where the account password will be authenticated against different methods, depending on the sshd configuration). With certificates you still have to put a password, but this time is the password of your private key (that's independent of the account's password). If you want to avoid putting the certificate's password every time then you can use ssh-agent, as pointed out by DigitalRoss The exact way you do this depends on Unix vs Windows, but essentially you need to run ssh-agent in the background when you log in, and then the first time you log in, run ssh-add to give the agent your passphrase. All ssh-family commands will then consult the agent and automatically pick up your passphrase. But this is on that particular shell. With keychain you can do the same thing as ssh-agent but "system-wide".

`@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python are both callable without instantiating the class, but differ in their inheritance behavior: `@staticmethod` is immutable via inheritance, while `@classmethod` follows subclass inheritance with `cls` as the first argument.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
@staticmethod function is nothing more than a function defined inside a class. It is callable without instantiating the class first. ItÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ definition is immutable via inheritance. @classmethod function also callable without instantiating the class, but its definition follows Sub class, not Parent class, via inheritance.

### Summary
@staticmethod and @classmethod in Python differ in their call signatures and usage. A classmethod implicitly passes the class of the object instance as the first argument, while a staticmethod passes neither self (the object instance) nor cls (the class) as the first argument.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Below is the usual way an object instance calls a method. The object instance, <code>a</code>, is implicitly passed as the first argument. <strong>With classmethods</strong>, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument instead of <code>self</code>. One use people have found for class methods is to create inheritable alternative constructors. <strong>With staticmethods</strong>, neither <code>self</code> (the object instance) nor  <code>cls</code> (the class) is implicitly passed as the first argument. They behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an instance or the class: Staticmethods are used to group functions which have some logical connection with a class to the class.

Use `FirstOrDefault` when you don't care about the number of items or can't afford uniqueness checks, and `SingleOrDefault` when you need to ensure a single item exists and can tolerate the performance overhead.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:

In many cases, there is a high probability to find an item. <strong>Conclusion</strong> <li>Use <code>FirstOrDefault</code> if you don't care how many items there are <strong>or</strong> when you can't afford checking uniqueness (e.g. <li>Use <code>SingleOrDefault</code> if you don't have to care about performance too much and want to make sure that the assumption of a single item is clear to the reader and checked at runtime.

The default charset/encoding in Java is ISO-8859-1, but it can be overridden programmatically or via a command line parameter. However, the default charset used by OutputStreamWriter is UTF-8.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
First, Latin-1 is the same as ISO-8859-1, so, the default was already OK for you. When you do that, looks like Charset resets to UTF-8, from looking at the source. That at least explains most of the behavior. I'm guessing it isn't quite dealing with encoding via the same mechanism, which is weird.

Here is a concise summary of the answer:

The default charset/encoding in Java is determined by factors such as the OS default charset and default locale, and may not always match the system property "file.encoding".

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Looking into the implementation of the classes, it is caused by: <li>Charset.defaultCharset() is not caching the determined character set in Java 5. <li>Setting the system property "file.encoding" and invoking Charset.defaultCharset() again causes a second evaluation of the system property, no character set with the name "Latin-1" is found, so Charset.defaultCharset defaults to "UTF-8". <li>The OutputStreamWriter is however caching the default character set and is probably used already during VM initialization, so that its default character set diverts from Charset.defaultCharset() if the system property "file.encoding" has been changed at runtime.

(Admittedly this is a bit gimmicky for the purposes of showing user profiles on Stack Overflow, but maybe readers will find some use for it. :-))
Summary: A function was written to calculate age to a fraction, which was ported to C# from PHP.

### Summary
In Python, to check if an object is a list or tuple but not a string, use duck typing to see if it acts like a list, but explicitly check for strings first. This is because strings also act like lists, and a recursive function would cause a stack overflow if not handled specially.

Ground truth:
Web development in a dynamic language (JavaScript) on a VM that is incredibly fast (V8). Ability to handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal overhead on a single process. A lot of people already know JavaScript, even people who do not claim to be programmers. Using JavaScript on a web server as well as the browser reduces the impedance mismatch between the two programming environments which can communicate data structures via JSON that work the same on both sides of the equation.

It isn't reassuring that there's a way to do this other than on Windows. On Windows, OpenJDK's <code>get_temp_directory()</code> function makes a Win32 API call to <code>GetTempPath()</code>; this is how on Windows, Java reflects the value of the <code>TMP</code> environment variable. On Linux and Solaris, the same <code>get_temp_directory()</code> functions return a static value of <code>/tmp/</code>.

To set the temporary directory location in Java, you can set the System property "java.io.tmpdir" using the command-line option `-Djava.io.tmpdir=/mytempdir` or by calling `System.setProperty("java.io.tmpdir", "/mytempdir")` in the code.

Extractive summary:
by giving the option <code>-Djava.io.tmpdir=/mytempdir</code> to the <code>java</code> command. The property can also be changed from within a program by calling <code>System.setProperty("java.io.tmpdir", "/mytempdir)</code> ... modulo sandbox security issues.

Ground truth:
<li>The recommended way to set the temporary directory location is to set the System property called "java.io.tmpdir", e.g. by giving the option <code>-Djava.io.tmpdir=/mytempdir</code> to the <code>java</code> command. <li>If you don't explicitly set the "java.io.tmpdir" property on startup, the JVM initializes it to a <em>platform specific</em> default value. If you care about portability you should explicitly set the system property.

Here's a concise summary of the differences between the urllib, urllib2, and requests module:

The main differences between urllib, urllib2, and requests are: 
- urllib2 provides the `Request` class and allows specifying headers, whereas urllib does not. 
- urllib2 is recommended for its more declarative approach, but some utility functions are only available in urllib.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
urllib2 provides some extra functionality, namely the <code>urlopen()</code> function can allow you to specify headers (normally you'd have had to use httplib in the past, which is far more verbose.) More importantly though, urllib2 provides the <code>Request</code> class, which allows for a more declarative approach to doing a request: BIGBLOCK The short answer is, unless you're working with legacy code, you probably want to use the URL opener from urllib2, but you still need to import into urllib for some of the utility functions.

JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a technique that allows cross-domain requests by wrapping server responses in a JavaScript function call, enabling the browser to execute a callback function with the received data. This is useful for older browsers, but is considered less secure and has been largely replaced by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for modern use.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle.

JSP is a Java view technology that allows server-side template text in client-side languages. It supports taglibs and Expression Language for dynamic output and data access. JSP is compiled into a class by the servlet container and executed to generate HTML/CSS/JS output. 

Servlets are Java APIs that intercept client requests and generate responses. They can be configured to listen to specific HTTP URLs and reuse instances for multiple requests. Servlets provide methods to handle HTTP requests and responses.

JSF is a component-based MVC framework built on top of Servlets, providing components via taglibs. It uses Facelets as the preferred view technology, offering templating capabilities and a FacesServlet to handle requests and responses. JSF binds the view with the model using JavaBean classes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
JSP is a Java view technology running on the server machine which allows you to write template text in client side languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ect.). Servlet is a Java application programming interface (API) running on the server machine, which intercepts requests made by the client and generates/sends a response. JSF is a component based MVC framework which is built on top of the Servlet API and provides components via taglibs which can be used in JSP or any other Java based view technology such as Facelets.

### Summary
A `java.lang.IllegalStateException` occurs when trying to call `forward()`, `sendRedirect()`, or `sendError()` after the response has been committed. This can happen when a method block is not exited after calling one of these methods, or if the response buffer is committed before the method is completed. To fix this, add a `return` statement after calling one of these methods or introduce an `else` block.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A common misunderstanding among starters is that they think that the call of a <code>forward()</code>, <code>sendRedirect()</code>, or <code>sendError()</code> would magically exit and "jump" out of the method block, hereby ignoring the remnant of the code. If the <code>if</code> statement calls a <code>forward()</code> and you're afterwards calling <code>sendRedirect()</code> or <code>sendError()</code>, then below exception will be thrown: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot call sendRedirect() after the response has been committed To fix this, you need either to add a <code>return;</code> statement afterwards BIGBLOCK ... or to introduce an else block. BIGBLOCK To naildown the root cause in your code, just search for any line which calls a <code>forward()</code>, <code>sendRedirect()</code> or <code>sendError()</code> without exiting the method block or skipping the remnant of the code. Another probable cause is that the servlet writes to the response while a <code>forward()</code> will be called, or has been called in the very same method. Solution is obvious, just don't write to the response in the servlet.

Generated abstractive summary:
Binary trees are useful when balanced, with a height difference of at most 1 between sub-trees. This provides efficient lookups of O(log N), compared to O(N) for unbalanced trees. They become even more useful as multi-way trees, holding multiple items per node, which can be used for maintaining keys in indexes. Other applications of binary trees include binary heaps, hash trees, abstract syntax trees, Huffman trees, and routing trees.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A non-balanced binary search tree is actually useful for little more than educating students about data structures. That's because, unless the data is coming in in a relatively random order, the tree can easily degenerate into its worst-case form, which is a linked list, since simple binary trees are <em>not</em> balanced. Binary trees become truly useful when you balance them. This involves rotating sub-trees through their root node so that the height difference between any two sub-trees is less than or equal to 1. Of course, they become even more useful when you make them balanced <em>multi-way</em> trees rather than binary tress. That means that each node holds more than one item (technically, they hold N items and N+1 pointers, a binary tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree  with 1 item and 2 pointers). I've written database software optimised for the hardware where a node is exactly the size of a disk block (say, 512 bytes) and you put as many keys as you can into a single node. The <em>pointers</em> in this case were actually record numbers into a fixed-length-record direct-access file separate from the index file (so record number <code>X</code> could be found by just seeking to <code>X * record_length</code>). As to other uses for binary trees, there are a great many, such as: <li>Binary heaps where higher keys are <em>above or equal to</em> lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right); <li>Hash trees, similar to hash tables; <li>Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages; <li>Huffman trees for compression of data; <li>Routing trees for network traffic.

Binary trees have limited applications, primarily for educational purposes. Balanced binary trees (e.g., Red-Black, AVL trees) are more useful due to their O(logn) operation guarantee. They are often used for implementing maps or sets and can be used for sorting in O(nlogn). However, hash tables generally have better performance for searching, inserting, and deleting. Balanced binary search trees are useful when searching, inserting, deleting, and sorting are required, but hash tables are preferred for these operations.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Normal binary trees may end up being a list (or almost list) and are not really useful in applications using much data. Balanced trees are often used for implementing maps or sets.They can also be used for sorting in O(nlogn), even tho there exist better ways to do it. Also for searching/inserting/deleting Hash tables can be used, which usually have better performance than binary search trees (balanced or not). An application where (balanced) binary search trees would be useful would be if searching/inserting/deleting and sorting would be needed. It still would be O(nlogn) but with a smaller constant factor and no extra space needed (except for the new array, assuming the data has to be put into an array).

Question: Regular cast vs. static_cast vs. dynamic_cast
Answer: 
Summary: 
- `static_cast` is used for implicit conversions with no runtime checks, when the type is known.
- `dynamic_cast` is used when the type is unknown, returning null or throwing an exception if the cast fails.
- A regular cast (C-style cast) combines multiple casts, but is unsafe and does not use `dynamic_cast`, allowing private base-class casting but with compile-time errors.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>static_cast</code> is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. <code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering <code>dynamic_cast</code>. After much pulling out of hair I discovered that the <code>foreach</code> loops were the culprits.

Binary trees can be used to evaluate mathematical expressions, similar to reverse polish notation, where each node represents an operator or value and the order of operations is determined by the tree structure.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One interesting example of a binary tree that hasn't been mentioned is that of a recursively evaluated mathematical expression. Basically each node of the tree has a value that is either inherent to itself or is evaluated by recursively by operating on the values of its children. This use of a binary tree is akin to reverse polish notation in a sense, in that the order in which operations are performed is identical. Also one thing to note is that it doesn't necessarily have to be a binary tree, it's just that most commonly used operators are binary. At its most basic level, the binary tree here is in fact just a very simple purely functional programming language.

Generated abstractive summary:
Binary trees are a family of data structures with various performance characteristics, including binary search trees, binary tries, hash trees, heaps, Huffman coding trees, GGM trees, syntax trees, treaps, and T-trees. They have numerous applications in various fields:

*   Search and database operations (binary search trees, hash trees)
*   3D graphics and game development (binary space partition)
*   Network routing and image processing (binary tries)
*   Operating systems and priority queues (heaps)
*   Data compression and cryptography (Huffman coding trees, GGM trees)
*   Compiler design and parsing (syntax trees)
*   Wireless networking and memory allocation (treaps)
*   Database storage and retrieval (T-trees)

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
To squabble about the performance of <em>binary-trees</em> is meaningless - they are not a data structure, but a family of data structures, all with different performance characteristics. Applications of binary trees <li>Binary Search Tree - Used in <em>many</em> search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the <code>map</code> and <code>set</code> objects in many languages' libraries. <li>Binary Space Partition - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered. <li>Binary Tries - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables. <li>Hash Trees - used in p2p programs and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available. <li>Heaps - Used in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* <em>(path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including robotics and video games)</em>. Also used in heap-sort. <li>Huffman Coding Tree (Chip Uni) - used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats. <li>GGM Trees - Used in cryptographic applications to generate a tree of pseudo-random numbers. <li>Syntax Tree - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions. <li>Treap - Randomized data structure used in wireless networking and memory allocation. <li>T-tree - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so. In a (balanced) binary tree with <code>m</code> nodes, moving from one level to the next requires one comparison, and there are <code>log_2(m)</code> levels, for a total of <code>log_2(m)</code> comparisons. In contrast, an n-ary tree will require <code>log_2(n)</code> comparisons <em>(using a binary search)</em> to move to the next level.

Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods because they are not associated with any instance of a class, making polymorphism inapplicable. This design choice was driven by performance concerns and a desire to make Java familiar to C++ developers.

Java does not allow method overriding of static methods because they are treated as global functions and are not bound to an object instance. This means there is no notion of "this" or "super" in a static method, and therefore, method overriding makes no sense.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can <em>overload</em> static method, that's ok. But you can not <em>override</em> a static method, because class are no first-class object. You can use reflection to get the class of an object at run-time, but the object that you get does not parallel the class hierarchy. A static method is a global function; as a consequence there is also no notion of polymorphism and, therefore, method overriding makes no sense. You can invoke a static method through an object <code>obj1.staticMethod()</code> but that really syntactic sugar for <code>MyClass.staticMethod()</code> and should be avoided.

Generated abstractive summary:
Java does not allow overriding of static methods because it can create a trap for unwary programmers and is contrary to how Java handles statics. The author provides an example where a static method is not behaving as expected and suggests that it is a flaw in the design of Java.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Personally I think this is a flaw in the design of Java. My point is not that it creates an unsolvable problem, but that it creates a trap for the unwary programmer, because the language does not behave as I think a reasonable person would expect.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods because it doesn't make sense to do so, as there's no clear way to determine which method to call at runtime.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In general it doesn't make sense to allow 'overriding' of static methods as there would be no good way to determine which one to call at runtime. In the case of Java, one could imagine a language definition where it is possible to 'override' static methods as long as they are called through an object instance. However, all this would do is to re-implement regular class methods, adding redundancy to the language without really adding any benefit.

Question: Why doesn't "cd" work in a shell script?
Answer: The `cd` is done within the script's shell. When the script ends, that shell exits, and then you are left in the directory you were. "Source" the script, don't run it. Instead of: `do (Notice the dot and space before the script name.)`

Summary: The `cd` command in a shell script only applies within the script's temporary shell environment, which closes when the script ends. To persist the change, "source" the script instead of running it.

Generated abstractive summary:
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that decouples code by making it dependent on interfaces rather than implementations, allowing for easier unit testing and exchange of implementations. However, it can also make code harder to understand and introduces new potential bugs due to its reliance on external configuration files or annotations.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so. Personally I see the strong points of IoC and I really like them but I tend to avoid IoC whenever possible because it turns your software into a collection of classes that no longer constitute a "real" program but just something that needs to be put together by XML configuration or annotation metadata and would fall (and falls) apart without it.

Question: Random string generation with upper case letters and digits in Python
Answer: 
To generate a random string of 'n' characters consisting of upper case letters and digits in Python, import the 'string' and 'random' modules. Use a list comprehension to create a list of 'n' random characters, chosen from a sequence of upper case letters and digits, and then join them into a string.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Answer in one line:</strong> or even shorter starting with Python 3.6 using <code>random.choices()</code>: <strong>A cryptographically more secure version; see https://stackoverflow.com/a/23728630/2213647:</strong> In the example above, we use <code>[</code> to create the list, but we don't in the <code>id_generator</code> function so Python doesn't create the list in memory, but generates the elements on the fly, one by one (more about this here). Therefore <code>random.choice(chars) for _ in range(size)</code> really is creating a sequence of <code>size</code> characters.

Question: JavaScript isset() equivalent
Answer: 
The `typeof` operator can be used as an equivalent to `isset()` in JavaScript, returning `"undefined"` if a property doesn't exist or its value is `undefined`. Alternatively, the `hasOwnProperty()` method and `in` operator can also be used to check if a property exists, with the main difference being that `hasOwnProperty()` checks physical object properties, while `in` checks properties in the prototype chain.

MetadataException occurs when using Edmx in a different assembly from the code referencing it. To resolve, use the full assembly name (including public key token) instead of 'res://*/' in the metadata resource.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can get this exception when the Edmx is in one project and you are using it from another. The reason is <code>Res://*/</code> is a uri which points to resources in the CURRENT assembly. Instead of specifying Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´? you need to provide the full name of the assembly instead (including public key token).

### Summary
HTTP_HOST is obtained from the client's HTTP request header, while SERVER_NAME is a server-controlled value defined in the server configuration. SERVER_NAME is generally more reliable, but its value depends on the server configuration, specifically the "UseCanonicalName" directive in Apache HTTPD.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The <code>HTTP_HOST</code> is obtained from the HTTP request header and this is what the client actually used as "target host" of the request. The <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is defined in server config.

HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME in PHP differ in their reliability and origin: HTTP_HOST is sent by the client and can be manipulated, while SERVER_NAME comes from the server's VirtualHost definition but can also be manipulated under certain conditions.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>HTTP_HOST</code> is the target host sent by the client. <code>SERVER_NAME</code> comes from the server's <code>VirtualHost</code> definition and is therefore considered more reliable.

A segmentation fault is an error caused by accessing memory that does not belong to you, often resulting from incorrect memory management, such as accessing a null pointer, writing to read-only memory, or using a dangling pointer.

Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that __oes not belong to you.Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?It__ a helper mechanism that keeps you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Segmentation fault is essentially the same in most languages that let you mess with the memory management, there is no principial difference between segfaults in C and C++. And when you try to dereference dangling pointer (like <code>*p='A'</code>), you would probably get a segfault.

Generated abstractive summary:
In Java, static methods have a fixed signature and do not include the implied object parameter, unlike virtual methods. This means they cannot access object variables or methods since the context is not known. Java's design choice to not pass an object context to static methods is to improve performance and maintain the language's procedural style, inherited from C.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In a virtual method, the first parameter is implied: a reference to the object itself and when called from within the object, the compiler automatically adds <code>this</code>. There is no difference for static methods - they still have a fixed signature. However, by declaring the method static you have explicitly stated that the compiler must not include the implied object parameter at the beginning of that signature. Because of this difference between the two; virtual methods always have a reference to the context object (i.e. <code>this</code>) so then it is possible to reference anything within the heap that belong to that instance of the object. But with static methods, since there is no reference passed, that method cannot access any object variables and methods since the context is not known. This is just something you will have to accept when working with Java (or C#).

Here's a summary of the answer:

The `countLines(String filename)` method throws an `IOException`, which cannot be used in a method declaration. To resolve this, perform the operation in a `main(String[] args)` method, where the `IOException` can be handled or declared.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your <code>countLines(String filename)</code> method throws IOException. You can't use it in a member declaration. You'll need to perform the operation in a <code>main(String[] args)</code> method.

To upload files to a server using JSP/Servlet, you can use the following methods:

- **Servlet 3.0 and later**: Use the native API by annotating the servlet with `@MultipartConfig` and implementing `doPost()` to access the uploaded file using `getPart()`.
- **Servlet 2.x**: Use Apache Commons FileUpload to parse the multipart form data, including adding the necessary JAR files to the project and implementing the `doPost()` method to handle the file upload.
- **Workaround for GlassFish 3 bug**: Use a utility method to extract the file name from `getPart()` when `getParameter()` returns `null`.
- **Saving uploaded files**: Save the obtained `InputStream` to disk or database using a recommended approach.
- **Serving uploaded files**: Serve the saved file from disk or database using a recommended approach.
- **Ajax file upload**: Use Ajax (and jQuery) to upload files without changing the servlet code, but responding differently to the client.

Extractive summary:
If you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, then you need an additional utility method to obtain the submitted file name. If you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet (isn't it about time to upgrade?

Ground truth:
To browse and select a file for upload you need a HTML <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code> field in the form. As stated in the HTML specification you have to use the <code>POST</code> method and the <code>enctype</code> attribute of the form has to be set to <code>"multipart/form-data"</code>. Don't manually parse it!

Question: Why use a READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level?
Answer: The READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level allows dirty reads, relaxing the property of acquiring locks on data to maintain high isolation, but may result in reading invalid data and is not recommended as a general solution to deadlocking problems.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
But  here's what I think: "In theory there  is no difference between theory and  practice. In practice there is." I would never recommend using <code>nolock</code>  as a general "good for what ails you"  snake oil fix for any database  deadlocking problems you may have. But in practice adding <code>nolock</code> to queries that you absolutely know are simple, straightforward read-only affairs never seems to lead to problems... <strong>As long as you know what you're doing.</strong>

Generated abstractive summary:
Bias in a neural network is a neuron that lies in one layer, connected to all neurons in the next layer, emitting a constant value (1). It allows for easier training by adjusting only one parameter (weights) instead of two (weights and activation function values), enabling the control of layer behavior and representation of similar cases, such as m-of-n functions (AND, OR, NAND, NOR).

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1. Since the bias neuron  emits 1 the weights, connected to the  bias neuron, are added directly to the  combined sum of the other weights  (equation 2.1), just like the t value  in the activation functions.1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions. Perceptrons can represent all of the  primitive boolean functions AND, OR,  NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR).

Here is a concise summary of the answer:

A bias in a neural network adds another dimension to the input space, avoiding an input vector of all zeros and allowing for more flexibility in mapping inputs to outputs. Without bias, a linear function is used, which can be restrictive and lead to issues with certain functions, such as AND and OR, but can be overcome with the use of bias.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Using a bias, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe effectively adding another dimension to your input space, which always takes the value one, so youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe avoiding an input vector of all zeros. You donÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ lose any generality by this because your trained weight matrix needs not be surjective, so it still can map to all values previously possible. Without bias, this straight line has to go through zero, whereas with bias, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe free to put it anywhere.So, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂl see that without bias youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe facing a problem with the AND function, since you canÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ put both (1,-1) <em>and</em> (-1,1) to the negative side. With a bias, however, itÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ easy to draw the line.

You cannot reference a non-static variable from a static context because non-static variables are instance-specific and require an instance of the class to exist. To fix this, you need to create an instance of the class, which reserves memory for the instance variables, allowing you to access them.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Static fields and methods are shared with all instances. They are for values which are specific to the class and not a specific instance. To solve your problem, you need to instantiate an instance (create an object) of your class so the runtime can reserve memory for the instance (otherwise, different instances would overwrite each other which you don't want).

A LEFT JOIN is not faster than an INNER JOIN, and is actually slower due to its additional work and larger result set. However, there are rare circumstances where a LEFT JOIN might be faster, such as when the tables are very small and there are no indexes to cover the query.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results. It would also be expected to return more rows, further increasing the total execution time simply due to the larger size of the result set. Reflecting further on this, I could think of one circumstance under which a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> might be faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, and that is when: <li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows); <li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query. If you run this and view the execution plan, you'll see that the <code>INNER JOIN</code> query does indeed cost more than the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, because it satisfies the two criteria above. It's because SQL Server wants to do a hash match for the <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but does nested loops for the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>; the former is <em>normally</em> much faster, but since the number of rows is so tiny <em>and</em> there's no index to use, the hashing operation turns out to be the most expensive part of the query. Because of the size, the hash table version is actually slower. But increase it to 50 elements, or 5000 elements, and the list version slows to a crawl, because it's O(N) vs. O(1) for the hashtable. But change this query to be on the <code>ID</code> column instead of <code>Name</code> and you'll see a very different story. So the conclusion is more or less what I mentioned several paragraphs above; this is almost certainly an indexing or index coverage problem, possibly combined with one or more very small tables. Those are the only circumstances under which SQL Server <em>might</em> sometimes choose a worse execution plan for an <code>INNER JOIN</code> than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.

Question: INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN performance in SQL Server
Answer: The performance difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL Server is primarily influenced by the number of joins and whether the joined columns have indexes, which can lead to multiple table scans.

I condensed the answer to its core point, focusing on the key information about the factors affecting performance between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN.

Ground truth:
Your performance problems are more likely to be because of the number of joins you are doing and whether the columns you are joining on have indexes or not.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Since Oracle 9i there are two ways or declaring a directory for use with UTL_FILE. The older way is to set the INIT.ORA parameter UTL_FILE_DIR. The value can like any other PATH variable; it accepts wildcards. The alternative approach is to declare a directory object. Directory objects require the exact file path, and don't accept wildcards. In either case, the <code>oracle</code> OS user must have read and/or write privileges <em>on the OS directory</em>. So we cannot use either approach to expose a directory on our local PC to a process running on a remote database server.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

A binary semaphore and a mutex differ in their scope, speed, and usage: 
- Scope: Mutex is within a process, while semaphore can be used across processes.
- Speed: Mutex is faster than semaphore, with futex being the fastest.
- Usage: Mutex can be acquired and released multiple times by the same thread, while semaphore can only be acquired once and blocks subsequent attempts by the same process.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
i) Scope __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ The scope of mutex is within a process address space which has created it and is used for synchronization of threads. Whereas semaphore can be used across process space and hence it can be used for interprocess synchronization. ii) Mutex is lightweight and faster than semaphore. iii) Mutex can be acquired by same thread successfully multiple times with condition that it should release it same number of times. Whereas in case of semaphore if same process tries to acquire it again it blocks as it can be acquired only once.

To create a summary, I will focus on the key information provided in the answer. Since the answer is incomplete, I will assume the full answer is provided and the given snippet is just a part of it.

Since the given snippet only mentions "Math.min BIGBLOCK", which seems to be a placeholder or a typo, I will assume the answer is about using the Math.Min method in .NET to truncate a string. However, Math.Min is typically used for numbers, not strings. 

If the actual answer is about string truncation, it might be something like using the Substring method or a specific library. Since the answer is incomplete, I will create a summary based on the most likely scenario.

### Summary
Use the Math.Min method to truncate a string in .NET.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Or instead of the ternary operator, you could use Math.min BIGBLOCK

Question: Why Response.Redirect causes System.Threading.ThreadAbortException?
Answer: Response.Redirect() throws a System.Threading.ThreadAbortException to immediately terminate the current request, unless the endResponse parameter is set to false.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>Response.Redirect()</code> throws an exception to abort the current request. For <code>Response.Redirect()</code> there exists an overload: If you pass endResponse=false, then the exception is not thrown (but the runtime will continue processing the current request). If endResponse=true (or if the other overload is used), the exception is thrown and the current request will immediately be terminated.

### Example
Question: Why Response.Redirect causes System.Threading.ThreadAbortException?
Answer: Response.Redirect causes a System.Threading.ThreadAbortException because it ends the response prematurely, interrupting the IIS pipeline. To resolve this, use the Redirect overload with endResponse=false and call IIS to advance to the EndRequest stage after returning control.

This summary captures the main issue (prematurely ending the response) and the key solution (using the Redirect overload with endResponse=false).

Extractive summary:
The correct pattern is to call the Redirect overload with endResponse=false and make a call to tell the IIS pipeline that it should advance directly to the EndRequest stage once you return control: This blog post from Thomas Marquardt provides additional details, including how to handle the special case of redirecting inside an Application_Error handler.

Ground truth:
The correct pattern is to call the Redirect overload with endResponse=false and make a call to tell the IIS pipeline that it should advance directly to the EndRequest stage once you return control:

The error "Java SecurityException: signer information does not match" occurs when classes from the same package are loaded from different JAR files with different signatures.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This happens when classes belonging to the same package are loaded from different JAR files, and those JAR files have signatures signed with different certificates - or, perhaps more often, at least one is signed and one or more others are not (which includes classes loaded from directories since those AFAIK cannot be signed). So either make sure all JARs (or at least those which contain classes from the same packages) are signed using the same certificate, or remove the signatures from the manifest of JAR files with overlapping packages.

You can use a switch statement in JavaScript for substring matching, but it's not recommended in most situations. 

Here's how it can be done:

```javascript
switch (true) {
    case base_url_string.indexOf('xxx') !== -1:
        // code for xxx.local
        break;
    case base_url_string.indexOf('yyy') !== -1:
        // code for yyy.local
        break;
    default:
        // code for other cases
}
```

This works due to JavaScript's switch statement behavior: cases are evaluated in source text order, and the expressions after the case keyword are evaluated as expressions, not constants.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can't do it in a <code>switch</code> unless you're doing <strong>full</strong> string matching; that's doing <strong>substring</strong> matching. If you're happy that your regex at the top is stripping away everything that you don't want to compare in your match, you don't need a substring match, and could do: BIGBLOCK It would fail if <code>base_url_string</code> were, say, "yyy.xxx.local" whereas your current code would match that in the "xxx.local" branch. <strong>Update</strong>: Okay, so technically you <em>can</em> use a <code>switch</code> for substring matching, but I wouldn't recommend it in most situations.

Question: Do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null?
Answer: Objects are cleaned up by the garbage collector when no longer in use. Set to null if necessary for scoping (e.g., static fields), but usually not required.

If the object is <code>IDisposable</code> it is <strong>a good idea to dispose it</strong> when you no longer need it, especially if the object uses unmanaged resources. Not disposing unmanaged resources will <strong>lead to memory leaks</strong>. BIGBLOCK BIGBLOCK

Answer: Many years ago, to provide an age calculator gimmick on my website, I...
==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
In C#, objects are managed by the Garbage Collector (GC) and do not require manual disposal like in C++. The GC automatically collects objects that are no longer in use. However, objects that implement the `IDisposable` interface should be disposed of using a `using` block when no longer needed. The GC determines object lifetime based on references, but setting object references to null has no immediate effect on the object's lifetime. The GC uses a combination of generational GC and mark and sweep to collect unused objects, handling circular references and running on a separate thread.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Objects never go out of scope in C# as they do in C++. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. In practice, you don't have to worry about destruction, it just works and it's great :) <strong>EDIT</strong> On variable scope. To properly explain that aspect of CLR, I'll need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#. In both languages the variable can only be used in the same scope as it was defined - class, function or a statement block enclosed by braces. The subtle difference, however, is that in C#, variables cannot be redefined in a nested block. In C++, this is perfectly legal: BIGBLOCK In C#, however you get a a compiler error: BIGBLOCK Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned. Whenever a C++ variable, allocated on the stack, goes out of scope it gets destructed. In CLR, objects (i.e. reference types) are <strong>always</strong> created on the managed heap. In a way, C# objects are a lot like objects that are created using <code>new</code> syntax in C++ - they are created on the heap but unlike C++ objects, they are managed by the runtime, so you don't have to worry about destructing them. Jon Skeet compared object references in Java to pieces of string that are attached to the balloon, which is the object. Same analogy applies to C# object references. They simply point to a location of the heap that contains the object. Continuing down the balloon analogy, it would seem logical that once the balloon has no strings attached to it, it can be destroyed. In fact this is exactly how reference counted objects work in non-managed languages. Except this approach doesn't work for circular references very well. Imagine two balloons that are attached together by a string but neither balloon has a string to anything else. Under simple ref counting rules, they both continue to exist, even though the whole balloon group is "orphaned".

Dispose of objects and set fields to null when no longer needed to aid the garbage collector in freeing up memory. Unsubscribe from events and set delegates or expressions to null in the Dispose() method or as soon as possible to prevent memory leaks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
From experience I'd also advise you to do the following: <li>Unsubscribe from events if you no longer need them. <li>Set any field holding a delegate or an expression to null if it's no longer needed. A good place to do this is in Dispose(), but sooner is usually better. Setting fields referencing other objects to null and clearing collections on disposal can really help the GC figure out what objects it can remove from memory.

You should call `Dispose` on objects that implement `IDisposable` to free resources. Setting a reference to `null` does not guarantee garbage collection; it is eligible for collection during the execution of a method, not after setting the reference to `null`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Some might claim that calling <code>Dispose</code> on <code>DataSet</code>, for example, is pointless because they disassembled it and saw that it did not do anything meaningful. Let me illustrate my point with the following code. BIGBLOCK So when do you think the object referenced by <code>a</code> is eligible for collection? The correct answer is that it is eligible for collection sometime <strong>during</strong> the call to <code>DoSomething</code>. It is eligible <strong>before</strong> the reference is set to <code>null</code> and perhaps even before the call to <code>DoSomething</code> completes.

Dispose of objects by calling dispose and set them to null when no longer needed to prevent memory leaks, especially with WPF bindings and large objects.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Always call dispose. A lot of objects don't actually implement IDisposable, so you don't have to worry about them. If they genuinely go out of scope they will be freed automatically. Also I have never come across the situation where I have had to set something to null. In addition always unsubscribe from events that are not needed.

An index in SQL is a B-tree data structure used to speed up search operations, with two types: clustered (physically ordering rows) and nonclustered (binary tree without physical row order).

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Well in general index is a <code>B-tree</code>. There are two types of indexes: clustered and nonclustered. Clustered index creates a physical order of rows (it can be only one and in most cases it is also a primary key - if you create primary key on table you create clustered index on this table also). Nonclustered index is also a binary tree but it doesn't create a physical order of rows. Indexes are used to increase the speed of search.

To fix a NoSuchMethodError, add a library by following these steps: 
1. Add the .jar file to the build path.
2. Associate sources and javadocs (optional).
3. Drag the .jar file into the "lib" folder.

Ground truth:
The following steps are a working way to add a library. I had done the first two steps right, but I hadn't done the last one by dragging the ".jar" file direct from the file system into the "lib" folder on my eclipse project. Additionally, I had to remove the previous version of the library from both the build path and the "lib" folder. Step 1 - Add .jar to build path Step 2 - Associate sources and javadocs (optional) Step 3 - Actually drag .jar file into "lib" folder (not optional)

Singletons can be problematic when they have mutable state, as they can lead to thread-safety and synchronization issues, and can also create unpredictable and intermittent bugs. This is similar to how the rules of the game Monopoly can be twisted and changed by players, leading to chaos and a lack of consensus. In programming, a Singleton should only be used when a write-once, read-only instance of an object is necessary, and even then, its properties and members should also be immutable.

The difference between "Array()" and "[]" when declaring a JavaScript array is that "new Array(size)" can be faster, approximately 2x in Chrome, when the size is known, but the performance boost is lost if the array is filled beyond its initial size.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Oddly enough, <code>new Array(size)</code> is almost 2x faster than <code>[]</code> in Chrome, and about the same in FF and IE (measured by creating and filling an array). It only matters if you know the approximate size of the array. If you add more items than the length you've given, the performance boost is lost.

Here is a concise summary of the given answer:

A "const" function declaration at the end of a function in C++ makes it a compiler error for the function to change a class variable, but allows reading of variables. This is equivalent to declaring a function with a "const this" pointer, which restricts modification of class members. The "mutable" keyword can be used to make specific variables writable even in a "const" function.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A "const function", denoted with the keyword <code>const</code> after a function declaration, makes it a compiler error for this class function to change a member variable of the class.

Question: 'console' is undefined error for Internet Explorer
Answer: Try accessing the global context object (e.g., 'window' in browsers) or use an if statement to check if 'console' is undefined.

Here's a revised version with a more formal tone:
 
The 'console' is undefined error in Internet Explorer can be resolved by accessing the global context object or using a conditional statement to check if 'console' is undefined.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
An undefined variable cannot be referred directly. However, all global variables are attributes of the same name of the global context (<code>window</code> in case of browsers), and accessing an undefined attribute is fine. Or use <code>if (typeof console === 'undefined') console = ...</code> if you want to avoid the magic variable <code>window</code>, see @Tim Down's answer.

There's no fixed width and height for iPad browsers, but a common approach is to design a page with a width and height of 768x768 pixels, allowing for easy zooming and panning on both 1024x768 and 768x1024 orientations.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
That said, you can design your page to minimize the amount of zooming necessary. Your best bet is to make the width and height the same as the lower resolution of the iPad, since you don't know which way it's oriented; in other words, you would make your page 768x768, so that it will fit well on the iPad's screen whether it's oriented to be 1024x768 or 768x1024. To accomplish this, you'll likely want to divide your controls among a number of web pages. On the other hand, it's not the most worthwhile pursuit. Make boxes with relevant grouped data that can be easily double-tapped to focus on, and keep related controls close to each other. iPad users will most likely appreciate a page that facilitates the familiar zoom-and-pan navigation they're accustomed to more than they will a page that has fewer controls so that they don't have to.

3. Check for duplicate JAR files in the project folders and remove any unnecessary ones.
4. Verify package name conflicts between the project and other library projects.
5. Remove any manually added paths to the classpath file if they are not necessary.

Ground truth:
Go to Project __________________________________________ÃÂ» Properties __________________________________________ÃÂ» Java Build Path __________________________________________ÃÂ» Libraries and remove all except the "Android X.Y" (in my case Android 1.5). click OK. Go to Project __________________________________________ÃÂ» Clean __________________________________________ÃÂ» Clean projects selected below __________________________________________ÃÂ» select your project and click OK. That should work. It is also possible that you have a JAR file located somewhere in your project folders (I had copied the Admob JAR file into my src folder) and THEN added it as a Java Path Library. Another possible reason could be package name conflicts. In other ways this may be occurred if you accidentally or knowingly edit/ add any thing in the class path file manually .In certain cases we may add android.jar path manually to classpath file for generating java doc.On removing the that after javadoc generated code will works fine.Please check this too if any one still occurs.

There are two approaches to read a text file and print all strings in C: 

1. Use `fgets()` to read the file in fixed-size chunks, leaving newline characters intact, and print the buffer content.
2. Use `fread()` or `fgetc()` to process the file in fixed-size chunks or a single character at a time, or use `fgets()` or `fread()` with `strtok()` to split the buffer at whitespace.

Generated abstractive summary:
GET and POST are two types of HTTP requests. GET retrieves data from a resource, while POST submits data to be processed, potentially creating or updating a resource.

Extractive summary:
According to Wikipedia: and So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. One way to alleviate this problem is to make the URL unique for each request by appending a timestamp.

Ground truth:
GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Finally, an important consideration when using <code>GET</code> for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a <code>GET</code> request.

POST and GET are two HTTP request methods with different purposes: GET retrieves data and is idempotent, while POST changes the server state and carries more data.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
POST and GET are two HTTP request methods. GET is usually intended to retrieve some data, and is expected to be idempotent (repeating the query does not have any side-effects) and can only send limited amounts of parameter data to the server. GET requests are often cached by default by some browsers if you are not careful. POST is intended for changing the server state.

Generated abstractive summary:
The main differences between POST and GET are that POST allows file attachments and warns users against resubmitting data, and should be used to send data to a server, while GET is used to retrieve data from a server.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With POST you can also do multipart mime encoding which means you can attach files as  well. Also if you are using post variables across navigation of pages, the user will get a warning asking if they want to resubmit the post parameter. Typically they look the same in an HTTP request, but you should just stick to POST if you need to "POST" something TO a server and "GET" if you need to GET something FROM a server as that's the way they were intended.

Question: Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s)
Answer: Not sure, if it's the most efficient solution, but I would loop over all entries, and use a bitset to remember, which numbers are set, and then test for 0 bits. I like simple solutions - and I even believe, that it might be faster than calculating the sum, or the sum of squares etc.

Summary: The solution involves looping over the numbers 1-100, using a bitset to track set numbers, and checking for missing values.

Summary: The problem of finding the missing number(s) in a sequence from 1 to 100 is dependent on the value of k, requiring different approaches for different values of k.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
For different values of k, the approach will be different so there won't be a generic answer in terms of k. For example, for k=1 one can take advantage of the sum of natural numbers, but for k = n/2, one has to use some kind of bitset.

To find the missing number(s) in the range 1..100, use a set difference operation, which is supported by many programming languages, such as Ruby.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I'd go for using a set difference for Qk. It's probably not the most efficient solution but it's one I would use in real life if I was faced with such a task in this case (known boundaries, low boundaries). If the set of number would be very large then I would consider a more efficient algorithm, of course, but until then the simple solution would be enough for me.

Here's a summary of the given answer:

The problem can be solved in constant time (O(1)) by using a set to remove numbers from the given range (1-100) in at most 100 - k iterations. However, if the range is generalized to 1-N, the time complexity becomes O(N). To print the contents of the set in O(k) time, a hash set and a doubly linked list can be used to store the numbers.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
No matter how big k is, the problem can be solved in constant time because you can use a set and remove numbers from the set in at most 100 - k iterations of a loop. If we generalise the solution to the numbers from 1 to N, nothing changes except N is not a constant, so we are in O(N - k) = O(N) time. It seems to me that the interviewer was asking you how to <em>print out</em> the contents of the final set in O(k) time rather than O(N) time. However, if you change the way the set is implemented you can print out the numbers in k iterations. This is done by putting the numbers into an object to be stored in both a hash set and a doubly linked list. When you remove an object from the hash set, you also remove it from the list.

MVVM decouples the M (Model) and V (View) communication tasks from the C (Controller), making the controller cleaner and more reusable.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
From what I can tell, the MVVM maps to the MV of MVC - meaning that in a traditional MVC pattern the V does not communicate directly with the M. In the second version of MVC, there is a direct link between M and V. MVVM appears to take all tasks related to M and V communication, and couple it to decouple it from the C. In effect, there's still the larger scope application workflow (or implementation of the use scenarios) that are not fully accounted for in MVVM. By removing these lower level aspects from the controllers, they are cleaner and makes it easier to modify the application's use scenario and business logic, also making controllers more reusable.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
MVC and MVVM are not mutually exclusive patterns, but rather complementary approaches to software development. MVC is a server-side pattern for separating concerns, while MVVM is a client-side pattern used for two-way data binding in views. In MVVM, the ViewModel acts as a bridge between the designer and coder, and is typically a simple container that requires little testing. Controllers, which contain processing logic and decide what data to display, are still necessary in MVVM, and the two patterns can be used together to create a robust application architecture.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
MVC/MVVM is not an either/or choice. The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development. For ASP.Net, MVVM is used to two-way bind data within views. MVC on the other hand is a way of separating concerns on the server-side. For Silverlight and WPF, the MVVM pattern is more encompassing and can appear to act as a replacement for MVC (or other patterns of organising software into separate responsibilities).

To find the missing numbers in the range 1-100, calculate the product of numbers 1-50 (P1), then find the product of the remaining numbers (P2) by removing one number at a time. The product of the missing terms (a and b) is P1 - P2, and their sum (a + b) can be found from the given sum of the remaining numbers. Solve the quadratic equation to find the missing numbers.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Let product, P1 = 1 x 2 x 3 x ............. 50 When you take out numbers one by one, multiply them so that you get the product P2. The product of the two mising terms, a x b = P1 - P2. You already know the sum, a + b = S1. From the above two equations, solve for a and b through a quadratic equation.

Ground truth:
The problem with solutions based on sums of numbers is they don't take into account the cost of storing and working with numbers with large exponents... in practice, for it to work for very large n, a big numbers library would be used. In Haskell syntax... BIGBLOCK Storage used: <code>O(k)</code> for list, <code>O(log(n))</code> for stack: <code>O(k + log(n))</code>This algorithm is more intuitive, has the same time complexity, and uses less space.

Ground truth:
You could try using a Bloom Filter. Insert each number in the bag into the bloom, then iterate over the complete 1-k set until reporting each one not found. This may not find the answer in all scenarios, but might be a good enough solution.

A more efficient approach to finding the missing numbers in a sequence 1..100 is to use a set to track sent messages and remove them as corresponding replies arrive, resulting in an O(log k+1) time complexity after the last reply.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Depending on the problem and the requirements surrounding it, the obvious set-based solution might be the right thing and the generate-a-list-and-pick-through-it-afterward approach might not. This certainly isn't the fastest approach for batch processing pre-generated bags of numbers because the whole thing runs <code>O((log 1 + log 2 + ... + log n) + (log n + log n-1 + ... + log k))</code>. But it does work for any value of <code>k</code> (even if it's not known ahead of time) and in the example above it was applied in a way that minimizes the most critical interval.

instanceof checks if the left object is the same or a subclass of the right class, while isAssignableFrom checks if an object of the right class can be assigned to a reference of the left class.

Extractive summary:
In other words, instanceof operator checks if the left object is same or subclass of right class, while <code>isAssignableFrom</code> checks if we can assign object of the parameter class (from) to the reference of the class on which the method is called.

Ground truth:

To solve the problem of finding missing numbers in a sequence from 1 to 100, the algorithm uses a time complexity of O(k) and a space complexity of O(log(k)) by leveraging the floor and log2 functions for arbitrarily large integers.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You have an <code>k</code>-bit long integer (hence the <code>log8(k)</code> space) where you add the <code>x^2</code>, where x is the next number you find in the bag: <code>s=1^2+2^2+...</code> This takes <code>O(N)</code> time (which is not a problem for the interviewer). At the end you get <code>j=floor(log2(s))</code> which is the biggest number you're looking for. Then <code>s=s-j</code> and you do again the above: Simply, for each 2 bytes (or 1, or 3, or 4) you can use these functions to get the desired numbers, but this adds an <code>O(N)</code> factor to time complexity

Facebook does not support custom title, image, and description in share links directly from a flash app. However, there are workarounds: 

1. Calculate the values on the server and send them in page metadata.
2. Send metadata in the query string to the site.
3. Send calculation results in the query string to the site.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can't, it just doesn't support it. Options are: <li><strong>calculate on the page:</strong> When serving the page you need to do those same calculations on the server and send the title, etc on the page metadata. <li><strong>send metadata in the query string to your site</strong>: If you really must keep the calculation off the server, an alternative trick would be to explicitly set the metadata in the URL the users click to get to your site from Facebook. <li><strong>send the calculation results in the query string to your site:</strong> if those calculations just give you a couple numbers that are used in the metadata, you could include just that in the query string of the URL the users click back to your site.

Question: RegEx: Grabbing values between quotation marks
Answer: (missing answer)

However, since the answer is missing, I'll create a generic summary:

Summary: A RegEx solution to grab values between quotation marks, accounting for escaped quotes and controlling backtracking.

Extractive summary:
This version <li>accounts for escaped quotes <li>controls backtracking BIGBLOCK As you've already identified, you cannot save from within a <code>foreach</code> that is still drawing from the database via an active reader. Calling <code>ToList()</code> or <code>ToArray()</code> is fine for small data sets, but when you have thousands of rows, you will be consuming a large amount of memory. It's better to load the rows in chunks. Given the above extension methods, you can write your query like this: The queryable object you call this method on must be ordered. This is because Entity Framework only supports <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;.Skip(int)</code> on ordered queries, which makes sense when you consider that multiple queries for different ranges require the ordering to be stable. If the ordering isn't important to you, just order by primary key as that's likely to have a clustered index. This version will query the database in batches of 100. Note that <code>SaveChanges()</code> is called for each entity. If you want to improve your throughput dramatically, you should call <code>SaveChanges()</code> less frequently. Use code like this instead: This results in 100 times fewer database update calls. Of course each of those calls takes longer to complete, but you still come out way ahead in the end. Your mileage may vary, but this was worlds faster for me. And it gets around the exception you were seeing. EDIT I revisited this question after running SQL Profiler and updated a few things to improve performance. For anyone who is interested, here is some sample SQL that shows what is created by the DB. The first loop doesn't need to skip anything, so is simpler. Subsequent calls need to skip previous chunks of results, so introduces usage of <code>row_number</code>:

Question: What are the differences between the HTTP 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 protocols?
Answer: HTTP 1.0 is a simple, stateless protocol with no built-in support for persistent connections. HTTP 1.1 introduced persistent connections and improved performance, but still has limitations. HTTP 2.0 (also known as HTTP/2) is a more modern, binary protocol with improved performance, multiplexing, and error handling.

Ground truth:
As Sam Dutton answered, a new method for this very purpose has been introduced in ECMAScript 5th Edition. <code>Object.keys()</code> will do what you want and is supported in Firefox 4, Chrome 6, Safari 5 and IE 9. However, some of the implementations out there aren't fully compatible with Internet Explorer. It also doesn't account for the famous DontEnum bug in Internet Explorer where non-enumerable properties on the prototype chain cause locally declared properties with the same name to inherit their DontEnum attribute.

Here is a concise summary of the answer:

The `def main()` function is used to encapsulate the main code, making it cleaner, easier to read, and better organized. It also allows for code to be imported as a module without side effects, enables running tests and debugging in an interactive shell, and can be called from other scripts or the command line with custom parameters.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Reasons to have that <code>if</code> statement calling <code>main()</code> (in no particular order): <li>Other languages (like C and Java) have a <code>main()</code> function that is called when the program is executed. Using this <code>if</code>, we can make Python behave like them, which feels more familiar for many people. <li>Code will be <em>cleaner</em>, easier to read, and better organized. (yeah, I know this is subjective) <li>It will be possible to <code>import</code> that python code as a module without nasty side-effects. <li>This means it will be possible to run tests against that code. <li>This means we can import that code into an interactive python shell and test/debug/run it. <li>Variables inside <code>def main</code> are <strong>local</strong>, while those outside it are <strong>global</strong>. But, you are <strong>not required</strong> to write a <code>main()</code> function and call it inside an <code>if</code> statement.

Here's a concise summary of the provided answer:

To create a generic array in Java, use the `Class` object as a runtime type token and pass it to the `newInstance` method of `java.lang.reflect.Array`. This allows you to create an array of a specific type, preserving type safety. The `Class` object is created by appending `.class` to the class name, e.g. `String.class`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with <code>.class</code>. This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. Note that you won't be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can't be used for type variables. Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument. Calling the method <code>getComponentType</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the component type of the array represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called (e.g. Calling <code>String[].class.getComponentType()</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>, but its type is <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, not <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>, which is why you can't do something like the following.

Question: End of File (EOF) in C
Answer: EOF is represented as -1, similar to other POSIX system calls that return -1 on error. A boolean operation like getchar() != EOF returns 1 for true and 0 for false, making EOF identifiable as 0. EOF can be emulated by pressing Ctrl+D when reading from stdin.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<li>Why <code>EOF</code> is -1: usually -1 in POSIX system calls is returned on error, so i guess the idea is "EOF is kind of error" <li>any boolean operation (including !=) returns 1 in case it's TRUE, and 0 in case it's FALSE, so <code>getchar() != EOF</code> is <code>0</code> when it's FALSE, meaning <code>getchar()</code> returned <code>EOF</code>. <li>in order to emulate <code>EOF</code> when reading from <code>stdin</code> press Ctrl+D

EOF in C indicates "end of file" and has a value of -1. It is not the same as a newline character. To provoke an EOF, use CTRL-D (Unix) or CTRL-Z (Windows).

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A newline (which is what happens when you press enter) isn't the end of a <em>file</em>, it's the end of a <em>line</em>, so a newline doesn't terminate this loop. The value of EOF is -1 because it has to be different from any return value from <code>getchar</code> that is an actual character. If you're typing at the terminal and you want to provoke an end-of-file, use CTRL-D (unix-style systems) or CTRL-Z (Windows).

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
EOF is defined as -1 in C, which is used to represent the end of a file. It's used in conjunction with the getchar() function to check if the end of a file has been reached. The EOF is typically triggered by a user input of control-Z on Windows or control-D on Unix systems.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
EOF is -1 because that's how it's defined. They make it equal to -1 because it has to be something that can't be mistaken for an actual byte read by <code>getchar()</code>. The <code>!=</code> operator means "not equal". 0 stands for false, and anything else stands for true. Of course, you can always type more, so you need an explicit way to say "I'm done". On Windows systems, this is control-Z. On Unix systems, this is control-D. Reading until EOF means that you read everything, until the user says "I'm done", and then you can't read any more. Reading until '\n' means that you read a line of input. Reading until '\0' is a bad idea if you expect the user to type the input, because it is either hard or impossible to produce this byte with a keyboard at the command prompt :)

You cannot rely on client-side JavaScript to verify user credentials due to security concerns. Instead, use a form with a submit button to send the username and password to a server-side program, which can be written in JavaScript (using a server-side JavaScript engine like Node.js) to check the credentials. After verification, the server can redirect the user to the desired page by emitting an HTTP Location header.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You <strong>cannot</strong> sanely depend on <em>client side</em> JavaScript to determine if user credentials are correct. The browser (and all code that executes that) is under the control of the user, not you, so it is not trustworthy. Note that you need to check the credentials are OK (usually by storing a token, which isn't the actual password, in a cookie) before outputting any private page.

To fix the error, reference the method as an instance by adding parentheses after the method name, e.g., `fibo = f.fibo()` instead of `fibo = f.fibo`.

Extractive summary:
You probably wanted <code>fibo = f.fibo()</code> (note the parentheses) to make <em>an instance</em> of the class, after which <code>fibo.f()</code> should succeed correctly.

Ground truth:
<code>f.fibo.f()</code> fails because you are essentially calling <code>f(self, a=0)</code> without supplying <code>self</code>; <code>self</code> is "bound" automatically when you have an instance of the class.

To fix the error, you need to call the method on an instance of the class, not the class itself.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
OK, first of all, you don't have to get a reference to the module into a different name; you already have a reference (from the <code>import</code>) and you can just use it. Second, you are getting a reference to the class rather than instantiating the class. The error usually means you are calling the method on the class rather than on an instance, which is exactly what was happening in this case because you hadn't instantiated the class.

Polymorphism refers to "many forms" and can be achieved through interface implementation, not just inheritance, providing a more flexible approach to describing behavior.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Polymorphism simply means "Many Forms". So, since interfaces describe behavior, and method names describe behavior (to the programmer), it is not too far of a stretch to consider method overloading as a lesser form of polymorphism.

There are five units of measurement used in Android development: pixels (px), inches (in), millimeters (mm), points (pt), and density-independent pixels (dp) and scale-independent pixels (sp). 

- **px**: corresponds to actual pixels on the screen.
- **in**: based on physical screen size (1 inch = 2.54 cm).
- **mm**: based on physical screen size (1 mm = 0.03937 inches).
- **pt**: 1/72 of an inch based on physical screen size.
- **dp**: Density-independent Pixels, an abstract unit based on screen density (160 dpi).
- **sp**: Scale-independent Pixels, similar to dp but also scaled by user's font size preference.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>px</strong>
<strong>Pixels</strong> - corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. <strong>in</strong>
<strong>Inches</strong> - based on the physical size of the screen. <strong>mm</strong>
&gt; <strong>Millimeters</strong> - based on the physical size of the screen. <strong>dp</strong> or <strong>dip</strong>
&gt; <strong>Density</strong>-independent Pixels - an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a <code>160</code>
dpi screen, so one dp is one pixel on a <code>160</code> dpi screen. <strong>sp</strong>
&gt; Scaleable Pixels <strong>OR</strong> scale-independent pixels - this is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended you
use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted
for both the screen density and the user's preference. From Understanding Density Independence In Android:

If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software, and any search engine. For specific use cases, longer URLs can be considered. Read on for all the details...
Longer answer - first, the standards... The executive summary is:

Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users. Search engines like URLs &lt; 2048 chars...
Be aware that the sitemaps protocol, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. While modern browsers will support longer URLs, search engines do not so the headline figure remains "under 2000 chars"

Summary: Strict mode in JavaScript helps prevent common coding errors by throwing exceptions and disabling features that are confusing or poorly thought out, and can be applied to the whole file or a specific function.

Ground truth:
Update for ES6 modules
Inside native ECMAScript modules (with <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> statements) and ES6 classes, strict mode is always enabled and cannot be disabled. Original answer
This article about Javascript Strict Mode might interest you: John Resig - ECMAScript 5 Strict Mode, JSON, and More
To quote some interesting parts:

Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. And:

Strict mode helps out in a couple ways: It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions. It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively "unsafe" actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object). It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out. So, I suppose it's a bit like the <code>"use strict"</code> you can use in Perl <em>(hence the name?)</em>: it helps you make fewer errors, by detecting more things that could lead to breakages. Strict mode is now supported by all major browsers.

The main difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch' is that 'git pull' automatically merges commits from the target branch into the current branch, whereas 'git fetch' retrieves commits from the target branch but stores them in the local repository without merging them.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>git pull</code> tries to automatically merge after fetching commits. <em>It is context sensitive</em>, so all pulled commits will be merged into your currently active branch. <code>git pull</code> automatically merges the commits <strong>without letting you review them first</strong>. <code>git fetch</code> gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in the current branch and <strong>stores them in your local repository</strong>. However, <strong>it does not merge them with your current branch</strong>. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on something that might break if you update your files.

### Summary
Git was designed for a distributed model with no central repository, allowing users to work disconnected and exchange code via email. To support this, Git maintains a local repository and a mirrored local repository of the remote repository. Two key commands are:

- `git fetch`: Updates the local copy of the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Updates the local copy of the remote repository and merges changes into the user's code repository and working copy.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It is important to contrast the design philosophy of git with the philosophy of a more traditional source control tool like SVN.
Subversion was designed and built with a client/server model. Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the "server" don't need to be online at the same time. In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. Normally <strong><code>git pull</code></strong> does this by doing a <strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy. The take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least <strong>three copies</strong> of a project on your workstation.

The "use strict" directive in JavaScript instructs the browser to use Strict mode, which is a safer feature set that disallows certain behaviors and provides additional error checking. Key features of Strict mode include:

- Disallowing global variables and silent failing assignments
- Forbidding octal syntax and the "with" keyword
- Restricting property names in object literals and function parameters
- Preventing the deletion of undeletable properties and plain names
- Disabling the "eval" function and the "arguments" object
- Forbidding the assignment of reserved names like "eval" and "arguments"

Overall, Strict mode helps catch errors and improves code quality by enforcing a more restrictive and predictable behavior.

Here's a concise summary of the given answer:

The difference between px, dp, and sp is as follows:

- **px** refers to the actual physical size of the screen measured in pixels.
- **dp** (density-independent pixel) is a virtual pixel unit used for defining UI layout, where 1 dp is equivalent to 1 physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen. It's used to ensure proper display on screens with different densities.
- **sp** (scale-independent pixel) is similar to dp but is used for font sizes, where it's scaled based on the user's font size preference.
 
To support multiple screens of different sizes and densities, developers should use dp and sp units for UI layout and font sizes, respectively.

Extractive summary:
Pretty much everything about this and how to achieve the best support for multiple screens of different sizes and densities is very well documented here: Supporting Multiple Screens Screen size</strong>
Actual physical size, measured as the screen's diagonal. For simplicity, Android groups all actual screen sizes into four
generalized sizes: small, normal, large, and extra-large.
<strong> Screen density</strong>
The number of pixels within a physical area of the
screen; usually referred to as dpi (dots per inch). For example, a
"low" density screen has fewer pixels within a given physical area,
compared to a "normal" or "high" density screen. For simplicity,
Android groups all actual screen densities into six generalized
densities: low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high, and
extra-extra-extra-high. <strong>Orientation</strong> This is either landscape or portrait, meaning that the screen's
aspect ratio is either wide or tall, respectively. Be aware that not
only do different devices operate in different orientations by
default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user
rotates the device. <strong>Resolution</strong> When adding support for multiple screens, applications do
not work directly with resolution; applications should be concerned
only with screen size and density, as specified by the generalized
size and density groups. A virtual
pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express
layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160
dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a
"medium" density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles
any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density
of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:
<code>px (dpi / 160)</code>. For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp
equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when
defining your application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on
screens with different densities. If you are at all serious about developing an Android app for more than one type of device, you should have read the screens support development document at least once. In addition to that, it is always a good thing to know the actual number of active devices that have a particular screen configuration.

The main difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch' is that 'git fetch' retrieves changes from the remote repository and updates the local 'origin/master' pointer, while 'git pull' does this and also merges the changes into the local 'master' branch.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It cost me a little bit to understand what was the difference, but this is a simple explanation. <code>master</code> in your localhost is a branch. When you clone a repository you fetch the entire repository to you local host. This means that at that time you have an origin/master pointer to <code>HEAD</code> and master pointing to the same <code>HEAD</code>. But the origin/master pointer is still pointing to what it was when you cloned. If you do a <code>git fetch</code> it will just fetch all the changes in the remote repository (GitHub) and move the origin/master pointer to <code>HEAD</code>. If you do a <code>git pull</code>, it will do basically fetch (as explained previously) and merge any new changes to your master branch and move the pointer to <code>HEAD</code>.

Here is a concise summary of the answer:

The "use strict" directive in JavaScript is not a simple addition to existing code, as it can introduce unexpected errors in previously working code. It's recommended to apply it only to new, greenfield projects with comprehensive unit tests and a strict code analysis tool, such as JSHint/JSLint. Adding it to existing code can be hazardous and should be done with caution, ideally with a thorough testing and refactoring process.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A word of caution, all you hard-charging programmers:  applying <code>"use strict"</code> to existing code can be hazardous! This thing is not some feel-good, happy-face sticker that you can slap on the code to make it 'better'. With the <code>"use strict"</code> pragma, the browser will suddenly THROW exceptions in random places that it never threw before just because at that spot you are doing something that default/loose JavaScript happily allows but strict JavaScript abhors! You may have strictness violations hiding in seldom used calls in your code that will only throw an exception when they do eventually get run - say, in the production environment that your paying customers use! If you are going to take the plunge, it is a good idea to apply <code>"use strict"</code> alongside comprehensive unit tests and a strictly configured JSHint build task that will give you some confidence that there is no dark corner of your module that will blow up horribly just because you've turned on Strict Mode. Or, hey, here's another option:  just don't add <code>"use strict"</code> to any of your legacy code, it's probably safer that way, honestly. <strong>DEFINITELY DO NOT</strong> add <code>"use strict"</code> to any modules you do not own or maintain, like third party modules. The best time to go strict is when your project is greenfield and you are starting from scratch.

Extractive summary:
Consider this example:

Ground truth:
The JavaScript strict mode is a feature in ECMAScript 5. In this mode, errors are thrown up when certain coding practices that could end up being potential bugs are detected (which is the reasoning behind the strict mode). Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code. If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break. Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically. So in strict
mode, implied global variables are no longer created. In strict mode, attempting to change a
read-only property will throw an exception. So in
strict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error.

To summarize the answer to the question "What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?", the key information is:

- dp and dip are equivalent and should be used for layout properties like margin and padding.
- sp is used for text size only.
- Android automatically converts these units to pixels at runtime for consistent sizing across different screen densities.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>dp</code> is  <code>dip</code>. Use it for everything (margin, padding, etc.). Use <code>sp</code> for {text-size} only. To get the same size on different screen densities, Android translates these units into pixels at runtime, so there is no tricky math for you to do.

The difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch' is that 'git pull' is a combination of 'git fetch' and 'git merge', which can result in automatic merging and potential merge conflicts.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The short and easy answer is that <code>git pull</code> is simply <code>git fetch</code> followed by <code>git merge</code>. It is very important to note that <code>git pull</code> will <strong>automatically merge whether you like it or not</strong>. This could, of course, result in merge conflicts. Unless you really, really know what you are doing, I would advise against that. This is a potentially dangerous mode of operation. Do not use this option unless you have read git-rebase(1)

Question: What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?
Answer: 
The difference lies in their representation of screen density and scaling. px (pixel) is a physical screen pixel, while dpi (dots per inch) represents display density. dp (density-independent pixel) and sp (scale-independent pixel) are virtual pixels that adjust based on the device's density and accessibility settings, with 1dp = 1px on mdpi and 1sp = 1.2dp with Large Text enabled. Use dp for non-text elements and sp for text size.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Definitions
<strong>px</strong> or dot is a <em>pixel</em> on the physical screen. <strong>dpi</strong> are pixels per inch on the physical screen and represent the density of the display. Android gives alias names to several densities <strong>dip</strong> or <strong>dp</strong> are <em>density-indenpendant pixels</em>, i.e. they correspond to more or less pixels depending on the physical density. What to use?

Use <strong>sp</strong> for Text size. Use <strong>dp</strong> for everything else.

Android supports four units of measurement for dimensions in XML: dp (density-independent pixels), sp (scale-independent pixels), pt (points), and px (pixels), with mm and in also available. Each unit scales differently based on screen density and user preferences.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
These are dimension values defined in XML. A dimension is specified
with a number followed by a unit of measure. The following units of measure are supported by Android:
<strong>dp</strong>
Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the
physical density of the screen. Using dp
units (instead of px units) is a simple solution to making the view
dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen
densities. In other words, it provides consistency for the real-world
sizes of your UI elements across different devices. <strong>sp</strong>
Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended that you use
this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for
both the screen density and the user's preference. This unit of
measure is not recommended because the actual representation can vary
across devices; each device may have a different number of pixels per
inch and may have more or fewer total pixels available on the screen. A dimension is a simple resource that is referenced using the value provided in the name attribute (not the name of the XML file).

The difference between px, dip, dp, and sp is that px represents a single pixel on the screen, while dip and dp are relative units that can vary in size depending on the screen's dpi, and sp is not explicitly defined in this context.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Basically the only time where px applies is one px, and that's if you want exactly one pixel on the screen like in the case of a divider:

On &gt;120 dpi, it rounds to 0.

To summarize the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch', there are two main commands to update a local repository with changes from the main branch:

- **Git Fetch**: Downloads changes made to the main branch, but does not apply them to the local branch, allowing for manual review before merging.
- **Git Pull**: Combines 'git fetch' and 'git merge', updating the local branch with the main branch changes, but may cause conflicts if not done with a clean copy.

The Difference between <strong>GIT Fetch</strong> and <strong>GIT Pull</strong> can be explained with the following scenario:
<em>(Keeping in mind that pictures speak louder than words!, I have provided pictorial representation)</em>
Let's take an example that you are working on a project with your team members. So there will be one main Branch of the project and all the contributors must fork it to their own local repository and then work on this local branch to modify/Add modules then push back to the main branch. To avoid such issues and to work parallel with the original progress of the project there are Two ways:
<strong>1. This will Download all the changes that have been made to the origin/main branch project which are not present in your local branch. This will update your local branch with the origin/main branch i.e. actually what it does is a combination of Git Fetch and Git merge one after another.

You don't get any isolation. Fun tip:

Ground truth:
In simple terms, if you were about to hop onto a plane without any Internet connection… before departing you could just do <code>git fetch origin &lt;branch&gt;</code>. It would fetch all the changes into your computer, but keep it separate from your local development/workspace. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody <em>else</em> has
been working on. You can consider
<code>git fetch</code> the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
The "use strict" directive in JavaScript is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 5 that restricts the language and provides more stringent error checking and security. It is a string literal that can be used at the beginning of a script or a function to indicate that the following code should be executed in strict mode. In strict mode, several key differences occur, including:

- Variables must be declared before use.
- The "this" keyword has a value of "undefined" in functions, unless called as a method.
- Assigning to readonly properties or defining new properties for non-extensible objects results in a TypeError.
- eval() has a new scope, and variables and functions declared within it are not accessible outside.
- The arguments object is a static copy of the function's arguments.
- The delete operator followed by a non-qualified identifier is a SyntaxError.
- Deleting non-configurable properties results in a TypeError.
- Duplicate property names in an object literal are a syntax error.
- Functions with multiple parameters of the same name are a syntax error.
- Octal literals are not allowed.
- The identifiers "eval" and "arguments" are treated as keywords and cannot be reassigned or used as variable names.
- Certain caller and arguments properties of functions are restricted.

Extractive summary:
I would like to offer a somewhat more founded answer complementing the other answers. I was hoping to edit the most popular answer, but failed. I tried to make it as comprehensive and complete as I could. You can refer to the MDN documentation for more information. <code>"use strict"</code> a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5. Directives are similar to statements, yet different. JavaScript engines, that do not implement ECMAScript 5, merely see an expression statement without side effects. It is expected that future versions of ECMAScript standards introduce <code>use</code> as a real key word; the quotes would thereby become obsolete. String literals statements, which follow a first real statement (in a script or function) are simple expression statements. Interpreters must not interpret them as directives and they have no effect. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important): You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode. In normal mode the identifier is implicitly declared as a global variable (as a property of the global <code>Object</code>) (In normal mode <code>this</code> always points to the global <code>Object</code>). This difference can be used to test if an implementation supports the strict mode: (In normal mode both simply fail without error message.) Instead, a new scope is created for <code>eval()</code> and the variables and functions are within that scope. That scope is destroyed after <code>eval()</code> finishes execution. In strict mode the arguments-object of a function contains a static copy of the values, which are passed to that function. In normal mode the arguments-object has a somewhat "magical" behaviour: The elements of the array and the named function parameters reference both the same value. In normal mode the <code>delete</code> expression would do nothing and is evaluated to <code>false</code>. In strict mode you will get a <code>TypeError</code> when you try to delete a non configurable property. (In normal mode the attempt simply fails and the <code>delete</code> expression is evaluated to <code>false</code>). In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when you try to define several properties with the same name for an object literal. (In normal mode there is no error.) In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when a function declaration has multiple parameters with the same name. (In normal mode there is no error.) In strict mode octal literals are not allowed (these are literals that start with <code>0</code>. (In normal mode some implementations do allow octal literals.) In strict mode the identifiers <code>eval</code> and <code>arguments</code> are treated like keywords. In strict mode are more restrictions on the possibilities to examine the call stack.

Ground truth:
I would like to offer a somewhat more founded answer complementing the other answers. The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important): You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode. In strict mode all variables have to be declared: if you assign a value to an identifier that has not been declared as variable, function, function parameter, catch-clause parameter or property of the global <code>Object</code>, then you will get a <code>ReferenceError</code>. In strict mode the keyword <code>this</code> has the value <code>undefined</code> in functions that were invoked as functions (not as methods). In strict mode, when passing code to <code>eval()</code>, you cannot declare or define variables or functions in the scope of the caller (as you can do it in normal mode).

**The difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'**

'git fetch' updates the local repository with the latest data from the remote repository, but does not merge the changes into the local working directory. 'git pull', on the other hand, updates the local repository with the latest data from the remote repository and merges the changes into the local working directory.

Ground truth:
I have struggled with this as well. Reading all these answers finally painted a picture in my head and I decided to try to get this down looking at the state of the 2 repositories and 1 sandbox and actions performed over time while watching the version of them. So here is what I came up with. This helped me understand why a fetch is pretty important.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is really no universal maximum URL length. The max length is determined only by what the client browser chooses to support, which varies widely. The 2,083 limit is only present in Internet Explorer (all versions up to 7.0). The max length in Firefox and Safari seems to be unlimited, although instability occurs with URLs reaching around 65,000 characters. Opera seems to have no max URL length whatsoever, and doesn't suffer instability at extremely long lengths.

Summary: The difference between px, dp, and sp is explained as follows:
- Density-independent pixel (dp): A virtual pixel unit used for layout dimensions, converting to physical pixels with the formula px = dp * (dpi / 160).
- Pixel (px): Used for specific cases like ListView divider lines, and should be avoided in layout files.
- Scale-independent pixel (sp): Used for font sizes, recommended for dynamic font sizes that change with device font settings.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure
proper display of your UI on screens with different densities. sp
Use sp for font sizes. Developers may get such a requirement for some specific screens, for that, developers can use dp instead of sp. In all other cases, sp is recommended.

"use strict" in JavaScript is a directive that enables strict mode, which throws exceptions for certain incorrect code patterns to help developers catch and fix issues earlier. It prevents global variable declarations, eliminates the use of the "with" statement, and throws errors for duplicate properties in object literals.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<em>My two cents:</em>
One of the goals of strict mode is to allow for faster debugging of issues. It helps the developers by throwing exception when certain wrong things occur that can cause silent &amp; strange behaviour of your webpage. The moment we use <code> use strict</code>, the code will throw out errors which helps developer to fix it in advance. Few important things which I have learned after using <code> use strict</code> :
<em><strong>Prevents Global Variable Declaration:</strong></em> When we implement <code>use strict</code> the code would throw error. They're also deprecated and removed from future JavaScript versions. <em><strong>Prevents Duplicates :</strong></em> When we have duplicate property, it throws an exception Duplicate data property in object literal not
allowed in strict mode

To summarize the given answer: 

'git pull' is equivalent to 'git fetch + git merge', as it automatically merges the latest data into the local machine. In contrast, 'git fetch' retrieves the latest data but does not merge it, requiring a separate 'git merge' command to apply the changes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If you run <code>git pull</code>, you do not need to merge the data to local. If you run <code>git fetch</code>, it means you must run <code>git merge</code> for getting the latest code to your local machine. So in the Git Gui, when you do fetch, you have to merge the data. Fetch itself won't make the code changes at your local. You will see the changed code.

Decimal is the preferred column type for storing product prices in MySQL due to its fixed-precision data type, which ensures exact representation of all values.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Decimal is the one I would use

The basic difference between
  Decimal/Numeric and Float : Float is
  Approximate-number data type, which
  means that not all values in the data
  type range can be represented exactly. Decimal/Numeric is Fixed-Precision
  data type, which means that all the
  values in the data type reane can be
  represented exactly with precision and
  scale. For the Decimal or Numeric
  data types, SQL Server considers each
  specific combination of precision and
  scale as a different data type.
  DECIMAL(4,2) and DECIMAL(6,4) are
  different data types.

Ground truth:
"Use Strict"; is an insurance that programmer will not use the loose or the bad properties of JavaScript. "Use Strict" will help you do "Straight coding". <strong>Modern JavaScript practice should always evoke the "Use Strict"; The only reason that the ECMA Group has made the "Strict" mode optional <em>is to permit less experienced coders access to JavaScript and give then time to adapt to the new and safer coding practices.</em>

Ground truth:
If part of the reason for open-source code is for code to be reused and recycled as it evolves, then I think influence and legacy would be two large factors in this decision. On this basis, I would probably vote Rogue / Hack / Nethack. It was one of the seminal influences behind the hack-and-slash dungeon-crawling genre, living on today in thriving communities that still play these old ASCII games, as well as having a significant influence on some of the most popular graphical games of all time, such as Diablo and Diablo 2.

The HTTP 1.1 specification does not impose a limit on the maximum length of a URL. However, servers should be able to handle URIs of any length, but may return a 414 status if the URL is too long. Client and proxy implementations may also have their own limits, with some older versions not supporting URLs above 255 bytes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The HTTP 1.1 specification says:

URIs in HTTP can be represented in
  absolute form or relative to some
  known base URI The two
  forms are differentiated by the fact
  that absolute URIs always begin
  with a scheme name followed by a
  colon. The HTTP protocol does not place
  any a priori limit on the length of
  a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
  the URI of any resource they    serve,
  and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
  unbounded length if they    provide
  GET-based forms that could generate
  such URIs.*</strong> A server    SHOULD return
  414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
  URI is longer    than the server can
  handle (see section 10.4.15). Note: Servers ought to be cautious about depending on URI
  lengths
        above 255 bytes, because some older client or proxy
        implementations might not properly support these lengths. As mentioned by @Brian, the HTTP clients (e.g. browsers) may have their own limits, and HTTP servers will have different limits.

Generated abstractive summary:
The main differences between px, dp, and sp are:

- **px**: Not a density-independent unit.
- **dp** (density-independent pixels): A unit that scales with the device density, but does not change with font size.
- **sp** (scale-independent pixels): A unit that scales with the device density and font size, but can break layouts if used carelessly.

Best practices include:

- Use dp for layout bounds and text size.
- Use sp for text size where necessary, but avoid breaking layouts.
- Avoid using sp for small text, toolbar text, or buttons.
- Use vector images for icons to ensure uniform quality across screen sizes.
- Consider custom font sizes for better readability.
- Refer to the official Android developer site for screen density and base density details.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Most Android developers miss this while developing apps, so I am adding these points. sp for text size, dp for layout bounds - standard. But <strong>sp for text size will break the layout if used carelessly</strong> in most of the devices. No standard app use sp for whole text</strong>
Use sp and dp for text size considering UX. Put sp for text where necessary, but make sure it won't break the layout when the user changes his settings. But now xxxhdpi phones are common so we have to include xxxhdpi assets at least for icons in the sidebar, toolbar, and bottom bar. It's better to move to vector images to have a uniform and better quality images for all screen sizes.

Units of measurement in Android development:
- **dp** (Density Independent Pixel): varies based on screen density, use for layout dimensions.
- **dip** (same as dp): previously used in Android, now deprecated.
- **sp** (Scale Independent Pixel): scaled based on user's font size preference, use for font sizes.
- **px** (pixel): standard screen pixel, use for graphics and images.
- **in** (inches) and **mm** (millimeters): physical screen size measurements.
- **pt** (points): 1/72 of an inch, physical screen size measurement.

Conversion formula: `px = dp * (dpi / 160)`

Ground truth:
Screen Size</strong> in <code>Android</code> is grouped into categories <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>, <code>large</code>, <code>extra large</code>, <code>double-extra</code> and <code>triple-extra</code>. Screen density is the number of pixels within an area (like an inch) of the screen. Screen density is grouped as low, medium, high, and extra high. Resolution is the total number of pixels on the screen. <strong>dp:</strong> Density Independent Pixel, varies based on screen density. Except for font size, use dp always. Scale Independent Pixel, scaled based on user’s font size preference. Fonts should use sp. The scaling occurs based on bucket sizes of 120(ldpi), 160(mdpi), 240(hdpi), 320(xhdpi), 480(xxhdpi), and 640(xxxhdpi).

The "use strict" directive in JavaScript is a literal expression that indicates code should be executed in "strict mode". This mode makes it easier to write secure JavaScript by throwing errors for previously accepted "bad syntax", such as mistyping a variable name, and preventing accidental global variable creation.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be
  executed in "strict mode". Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript. Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors. In strict mode, this will throw an error,
  making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable. In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a
  getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing
  variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.

Ground truth:
<code>"use strict"</code> makes JavaScript code to run in <em>strict mode</em>, which basically means everything needs to be defined before use. The main reason for using strict mode is to avoid accidental global uses of undefined methods. Also in strict mode, things run faster, some warnings or silent warnings throw fatal errors, it's better to always use it to make a neater code. <code>"use strict"</code> is widely needed to be used in ECMA5, <strong>in ECMA6 it's part of JavaScript by default</strong>, so it doesn't need to be added if you're using ES6. The
  purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be
  executed in "strict mode". With strict mode, you can not, for example,

Jakob Nielsen recommends keeping URLs under 78 characters to prevent them from wrapping across a line feed.

Extractive summary:
In URL as UI Jakob Nielsen recommends:

the social interface to the Web relies on email when users want to recommend Web pages to each other, and email is the second-most common way users get to new sites (search engines being the most common): make sure that all URLs on your site are less than 78 characters long so that they will not wrap across a line feed.

To design a UI for Android apps that can handle different screen sizes, Android defines minimum required space for each screen size in dp (density-independent pixels). The four screen densities are ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, and xhdpi, with a 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio. To design for different densities, create graphics and bitmap images in each density, or use a density-independent unit (dp) and map it to pixels using the formula 1dp = 1px under 160 dpi.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I've come across a good article about designing Android apps UI for different screen resolutions, and I'd like to leave it here just for somebody searching in this area. It remained unclear to me how to design layouts capable to handle different screen sizes. Designing flexible UI in Android is not an easy thing (at the best). Many designers have problems designing Android app UI in photoshop or another pixel
based graphic design tools because of the density-independent unit, dp. Google also doesn’t give
a clear Android UI design guide for them, though they give a basic
formula for dp and pixel translation. This size unit scales with the screen size (this also mentioned in an answer here, about <code>SDP</code> library) Google has finally understood the usefulness of the iOS Storeboard UI concept, and here goes <code>ConstraintLayout</code> for Android world: Build a Responsive UI with ConstraintLayout

To understand the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch', your local git repository maintains a local copy of the remote repository. 'git fetch' updates the local copy of the remote repository, while 'git pull' updates your local repository with the changes from the remote repository.

Extractive summary:
Typically, <code>git pull</code> will do a <code>git fetch</code> first to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then it will merge the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.

Ground truth:
What is the difference between <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code>? <code>git fetch</code> brings your local copy of the remote repository up to date. This will allow you to perform operations such as compare or merge.
<code>git pull</code> on the other hand will bring down the changes in the remote repository to where you keep your own code. Typically, <code>git pull</code> will do a <code>git fetch</code> first to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then it will merge the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.

Git fetch and git pull differ in their behavior: 'git fetch' retrieves the latest version from the remote but does not automatically merge, whereas 'git pull' retrieves and merges the latest version into the local repository.

Extractive summary:
git fetch: Git is going to get the latest version from remote to local,  but it do not automatically merge.

Ground truth:
Git obtains the branch of the latest version from the remote to the local using two commands: git fetch: Git is going to get the latest version from remote to local,  but it do not automatically merge. git pull: Git is going to get the latest version from the remote and merge into the local. The command above is the equivalent to <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code>. In practice, <code>git fetch</code> maybe more secure because before the merge we can see the changes and decide whether to merge.

A C# program is used to demonstrate AES encryption and decryption using the RijndaelManaged class, while a slowAES WSC component is used in a Javascript client. The C# code encrypts a string using AES256 with a 32-character passphrase and a 16-byte IV of zeros, producing a specific ciphertext. The Javascript client using the slowAES WSC component produces the same ciphertext when given the same input.

It successfully decrypts in both cases. The source code that demonstrates AES interop between Javascript or VBScript and .NET is available. I extended the basic example given here to produce test apps in 3 languages: C#, Javascript and VBScript. You can easily verify that the ciphertext is the same for each of these test programs.

git pull is equivalent to git fetch followed by git merge, and git fetch does not modify local branches, requiring a manual merge to incorporate changes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
git pull == ( git fetch + git merge)
git fetch does not changes to local branches. If you already have a local repository with a remote set up for the desired project, you can grab all branches and tags for the existing remote using git fetch . Fetch does not make any changes to local branches, so you will need to merge a remote branch with a paired local branch to incorporate newly fetch changes.

There are four types of units used for measuring screen size in Android: dp, sp, and px. 

- **dp (density-independent pixels)**: The number of pixels represented in one unit of dp increases with higher screen resolution and decreases with lower resolution, based on a 160 dpi baseline.
- **sp (scale-independent pixels)**: Similar to dp, but also scales according to the user's font size preference.
- **px (pixels)**: Actual pixels on the screen.
For more information, see the Android Developer Guide on dimensions and screens.

Extractive summary:

Ground truth:
1) <strong><code>dp: (density independent pixels)</code></strong> The number of pixels represented in one unit of dp will increase as the screen resolution increases (when you have more dots/pixels per inch). Conversely on devices with lower resolution, the number of pixels represented in on unit of dp will decrease. This is the equation: <code>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</code>

2) <strong><code>sp: (scale independent pixels)</code></strong>
This unit scales according to the screen dpi (similar to dp) as well as the user’s font size preference. 3) <strong><code>px: (pixels)</code></strong> 
Actual pixels or dots on the screen.

Screen size in Android is categorized into ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, and xxxhdpi. The main differences between px, dp, and sp are:

- **px (Pixels):** Absolute pixels, not recommended for dynamic sizing.
- **dp (Density pixels):** Alternative to px, recommended for dynamic sizing. Android will automatically calculate pixel size based on a 160 pixel screen.
- **sp (Scale independent pixels):** Scaled based on user's font size preference, recommended for font sizes to grow and shrink dynamically based on screen sizes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Screen size</strong> in Android is grouped into categories <code>ldpi</code>, <code>mdpi</code>, <code>hdpi</code>, <code>xhdpi</code>, <code>xxhdpi</code> and <code>xxxhdpi</code>. Screen density</strong> is the amount of pixels within an area (like inch) of the screen. Generally it is measured in dots-per-inch (<code>dpi</code>). <strong><code>DP/DIP(Density pixels / Density independent pixels):</code></strong> <code>dp</code> is highly recommended to use in place of <code>px</code>. <strong><code>SP(Scale independent pixels):</code></strong> Fonts should use <code>sp</code>. Android Documentation says:

when specifying dimensions, always use either <code>dp</code> or <code>sp</code> units. A <code>dp</code> is
  a density-independent pixel that corresponds to the physical size of a
  pixel at 160 <code>dpi</code>. An <code>sp</code> is the same base unit, but is scaled by the
  user's preferred text size (it’s a scale-independent pixel), so you
  should use this measurement unit when defining text size

Generated abstractive summary:
Git pull and git fetch are two Git commands that differ in their functionality. Git fetch updates information from a remote branch without merging changes into the local branch, whereas git pull combines the effects of git fetch and a merge or rebase to update the local branch with changes from the remote branch.

Extractive summary:
It is actually the case if other SWEs are working one the same branch, and rarely the case in small one dev - one branch - one project scenarios. In order to bring the changes to your local branch you have to merge/rebase the changes from the remote branch. If your local history and the remote history have conflicts the you will be forced to do the merge during a git push to publish your changes. Thus it really depends on the nature of your work environment and experience what to use.

Ground truth:
One must keep in mind the nature of git. You have remotes and your local branches ( not necessarily the same ) . Usually when you checkout a remote a local copy is created that tracks the remote. In order to bring the changes to your local branch you have to merge/rebase the changes from the remote branch. git pull does exactly these two steps ( i.e. --rebase to rebase instead of merge ) Thus it really depends on the nature of your work environment and experience what to use.

"use strict" in JavaScript is a directive that was introduced in ECMAScript 5 to enforce strict mode in code. It can be triggered in various ways, including:

- Global code at the beginning of a script
- Module code
- Class declarations or expressions
- Eval code with a direct call in strict mode
- Function code contained in strict mode or with a Use Strict Directive
- Function code supplied to the Function or Generator constructors with a Use Strict Directive.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Note that <code>use strict</code> was introduced in EcmaScript 5 and was kept since then. Below are the conditions to trigger strict mode in ES6 and ES7: Module code is always strict mode code.

Screen pixel density varies across platforms, and device-independent pixels (dp) and scalable pixels provide a flexible way to design for different screen densities. Density-independent pixels (dp) are units that scale to have uniform dimensions on any screen, allowing for consistent UI elements across different densities.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Pixel density
Screen pixel density and resolution vary depending on the platform. Device-independent pixels and scalable pixels are units that provide a flexible way to accommodate a design across platforms. The number of pixels that fit into an inch is referred to as pixel density. High-density screens have more pixels per inch than low-density ones. <strong>Density independence</strong> refers to the uniform display of UI elements on screens with different densities. <em>Density-independent pixels</em>, written as <em>dp</em> (pronounced “<em>dips</em>”), are flexible units that scale to have uniform dimensions on any screen. Material UIs use density-independent pixels to display elements consistently on screens with different densities.

To recover lost SVN history during refactoring, use TortoiseSVN to repair the move operation by marking both the old and new file names, right-clicking, and selecting "Repair Move." Alternatively, resurrect the old file by copying an old revision, merge the new file's history, delete the new file, and then move the old file to the new name.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The SVN way to do this is actually to have SVN rename the file (<code>svn move</code> or using TortoiseSVN's "Rename"). However, if you absolutely <em>must</em> have some external tool to perform the rename operation, you can <strong><em>use TortoiseSVN to repair the move operation</em></strong>. The following will tell SVN that the new file is actually the renamed old one: If you already lost the history on a file where you miss it badly, you could resurrect the old file (you do this by <code>svn copy</code>ing an old revision's version into its old place), merge the new file's history into it, then delete the new file, and <code>svn move</code> the old file to the new file's name.

To insert multiple rows in a UITableView, update the table view with index paths that correspond to the added data in the datasource. Use `insertRowsAtIndexPaths` with the updated index paths after adding the data to the datasource.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The code is close, but the table view needs to be updated with index paths in exact correspondence with what's added to the datasource. You want a weakSelf to avoid cycle where the block owner retains the block and the block (by using the block owner "self") retains the owner. There's no need for the weakSelf pattern here since the view controller is not retaining a copy of the dispatched block.

Generated abstractive summary:
A screen's resolution is measured in pixels (px), but this can be misleading due to varying screen sizes and densities. Density-independent pixels (dp or dip) allow for consistent design across different devices, with 1 dp equal to 1 pixel at 160 dpi. This unit helps in designing for multiple devices with varying screen sizes and densities. Scale-independent pixels (sp) are used for font sizes, allowing for accessibility features like customizable font sizes for users with impaired eyesight.

Extractive summary:
1 Users that have trouble reading text can increase their device's font size. It's often also available through the accessibility settings. <strong>Reference</strong>: Udacity, Google

Ground truth:
The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as <strong>pixels (px)</strong>. A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important. <strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device. Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone. <strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size. With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.

Ground truth:
sp: scale independent pixel

You should use it with texts because it is automatically scaled according to the font size that is being used by the user in his device. px: pixel or picture element is the single point on the screen

To fix PHP DateTime microseconds always returning 0, you can specify that the input contains microseconds when constructing a DateTime object using microtime(true) and format it to include a decimal point.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can specify that your input contains microseconds when constructing a <code>DateTime</code> object, and use <code>microtime(true)</code> directly as the input. Unfortunately, this will fail if you hit an exact second, because there will be no <code>.</code> in the microtime output; so use <code>sprintf</code> to force it to contain a <code>.0</code> in that case:

The "use strict" directive in JavaScript prevents accidental declaration of global variables, restricts use of keywords as variables, and throws errors for invalid uses. It must be used at the beginning of a script or function to make the code less error-prone and promote good coding practices.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The main reasons why developers should use <code>"use strict"</code> are: Prevents accidental declaration of global variables. Using <code>"use strict()"</code> will make sure that variables are declared with <code>var</code> before use. The <code>"use strict"</code> directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function. In short will make your code less error prone and in turn will make you write good code.

The difference between px, dip, and sp units is as follows:

- **Pixels (px)**: represents actual screen pixels.
- **Density-independent Pixels (dp or dip)**: an abstract unit relative to a 160 dpi screen, scaling with screen density.
- **Scale-independent Pixels (sp)**: scaled by user's font size preference, recommended for font sizes to ensure UI compatibility across Android devices.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Pixels(px)</strong> – corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. <strong>Density-independent Pixels (dp or dip)</strong> – an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. <strong>Scale-independent Pixels(sp)</strong> – this is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user’s font size preference. Always use dp and sp only. It will make UI compatible for Android devices with different densities.

Generated abstractive summary:
There are three messaging patterns in WCF: synchronous request-response, asynchronous send (one-way service), and asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service). The choice of pattern depends on the application's needs. 

For a scenario where the client needs to be notified of success after data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are suitable. 

Option 1 (synchronous request-response) returns a 200 response after the service completes all tasks, blocking the client until the response is received. 

Option 2 (asynchronous send) returns a 202 response, indicating that the message has been accepted, but the processing is not complete. The client continues execution without waiting for the result.

Option 3 (asynchronous request-response) is similar to option 2, but with a callback mechanism. The client provides an InstanceContext object to handle the callback, and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response. 

To implement these patterns, WCF provides different configurations, including default synchronous behavior, one-way operations, and duplex services.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There are three messaging patterns mentioned here: All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate. Option 2
Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not. Option 3
Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. As Whisk mentioned, Juval Lowy has an article covering a lot this detail (and more!) One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown.

"Use strict" in JavaScript enforces a strict set of rules, reducing errors and ambiguities by following programming language conventions.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
After using <code>"use strict"</code>, the JavaScript code should follow strict set of rules as in other programming languages such as use of terminators, declaration before initialization, etc. If <code>"use strict"</code> is used, the code should be written by following a strict set of rules, hence decreasing the chances of errors and ambiguities.

Instead of requesting all GHC extensions, use the LANGUAGE pragma to specify the used extensions. Parallel list comprehensions can be simulated using the zip function. Extensions are not inherently bad, but some are considered for inclusion in the next Haskell standard, and others should be used with caution.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Instead of requesting <em>all</em> GHC extensions, specify which ones are used using the <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma mechanism: Parallel iteration over the same list is allowed. The problem is that parallel comprehensions are not defined in the Haskell 98 standard. Extensions themselves are not bad -- much of the standard library uses extensions, of one sort or another. Any extension listed in the HaskellExtensions wiki page with support from two or more compilers is probably safe to use.

Recursion is not recommended for building a web spider due to the potential for infinite loops and complexity in handling links between pages. A more suitable approach is to use a queue to store and process links iteratively.

Ground truth:
Definitely not, you're going to run into problems very quickly because of the actual nature of the world wide web. The second you hit a site with a main navigation section, where each page links to each other page, you've entered an infinite loop. You're better off finding all links on the current page and adding those links (if they don't already exist) to a central queue, and proceeding iteratively through the queue processing every link as you come to it (remember to keep track of links that you've finished processing, or you'll add them to the end of the queue again)

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

Python decompression relative performance is compared between using `numpy.savez_compressed`, PIL, and `pickle` with `lz4` compression. The results show that `numpy.savez_compressed` is 2.3x faster than PIL, while `pickle` with `lz4` compression is 2.4x faster than PIL and 30% slower than uncompressed `pickle`. The `pickle` with `lz4` variant is the fastest method, with a load time of 1.3 seconds for a 7.1M file.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Loading is 2.3x faster than your PIL-based code. It only costs 5% of the slow loading time. Fast decompression
According to the zstd benchmarks, when optimizing for decompression lz4 is a good choice. Just plugging this into pickle gives another 2.4x gain and is only 30% slower than uncompressed pickling. The load time was measured inside Python (3.7.3), using the minimum wall-clock time over 20 runs on my desktop. Most time is spent inside of the Linux kernel, doing <code>page_fault</code> and stuff associated with (re-)allocating memory, probably including disk I/O.

Ground truth:
<strong>"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in

CLion may not link with OpenCV for Windows due to compatibility issues. To resolve this, OpenCV must be built from source. Key steps include:

- Understanding CMake, which is central to CLion's operation.
- Specifying OpenCV in the project's CMakeLists.txt file.
- Setting the OpenCV_DIR environment variable to the build folder, not the root of the OpenCV installation.
- Overcoming potential conflicts between OpenCVConfig.cmake and CLion's environment variables.
- Building OpenCV with the same compiler as CLion (e.g., MinGW or Cygwin) to avoid linker issues.
- Enabling diagnostic messages in OpenCVConfig.cmake or FindOpenCV.cmake to troubleshoot problems.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The short answer is, <strong>you will probably need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</strong>. But given the number and range of partially answered and unanswered questions here* and elsewhere on using JetBrains' CLion IDE with the OpenCV library, I think an overview is needed (my notes are from CLion 2016.3 and OpenCV 3.1, YMMV): This probably means <strong><em>you will need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</em></strong>. Hopefully this provides some general guidance on resolving <em>CLion / CMake / OpenCV</em>

Python Decompression Performance: 
Blosc library is a fast compression library that can be used for Python arrays. It is particularly effective for small arrays (<2GB) and can be faster for IO operations, with compression speeds reaching up to 3500MB/s. The decompression step can be improved by pre-allocating memory for the array.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can use Python-blosc
It is very fast and for small arrays (&lt;2GB) also quite easy to use. On easily compressable data like your example, it is often faster to compress the data for IO operations. In the decompression step the array allocation is the most costly part. If your images are of similar shape you can avoid repeated memory allocation. It does handle f-contiguous, c-contiguous and non-contiguous arrays and arrays &gt;2GB.

The error "No such file or directory" is caused by the loader being unable to find the executable file. This can be resolved by changing the loader used by the executable to one that is available on the system. 

To fix this, run the command `readelf -l arm-mingw32ce-g++ | grep interpreter` to find the current loader path, then use `patchelf --set-interpreter /path/to/newglibc/ld-linux.so.2 arm-mingw32ce-g++` to change the loader to the correct one.

Ground truth:
As mentioned by others, this is because the loader can't be found, not your executable file. You can fix it by changing the loader that your executable uses, see my thorough answer in this other question: Multiple glibc libraries on a single host

Hash tables can be resized to maintain fast access, but resizing takes linear time, making insertion time constant on average but O(n) in worst case.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
For some uses of hash tables, it's impossible to create them of the "right" size in advance, because it is not known how many elements will need to be held simultaneously during the lifetime of the table. If you want to keep fast access, you need to resize the table from time to time as the number of element grows. These resizing operations can be made seldom enough that the amortized cost of insertion is still constant (by following a geometric progression for the size of the table, for instance doubling the size each time it is resized). In practice, this is not a problem unless you are building hard real-time applications.

0: none
+100: bullish pattern
+200: bullish pattern with confirmation

Ground truth:
-200 / -100 / 0 / +100 / +200
<strong>+200</strong> bullish pattern with confirmation
<strong>+100</strong> bullish pattern (most cases)
<strong>0</strong> none
<strong>-100</strong> bearish pattern
<strong>-200</strong> bearish pattern with confirmation

as you can see in the source:

https://sourceforge.net/p/ta-lib/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/ta-lib/c/src/ta_func/ta_CDLHIKKAKE.c#l240

you can get one more -100 or +100 (that makes it -200/+200):
<strong>if your pattern have confirmation</strong>. so the calculation will be (pattern+confirmation)
in that way,
you can potentially detect bearish pattern on some days, and one more day that confirm the pattern. and for the end get -200

"Strict mode in JavaScript is an alternative interpretation of code that aims to correct some of the language's design mistakes, such as the ambiguous behavior of the 'this' keyword. It does this by creating a new context for the code while still allowing for backward compatibility."

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
JavaScript was designed and implemented hastily because of the browser wars and bad management. Strict mode aims to amend some of these mistakes. But fixing these mistakes without creating alternative interpretation breaks backward compatibility. So, <code>"use strict"</code> directive creates that alternative interpretation of the code while communicating it to the programmer. In strict mode <code>this</code> in a global function resolves to undefined, which is what we expect. Some mistakes can not be fixed even in strict mode because syntax should be valid for older browsers since they ignore <code>"strict mode"</code> directive.

Using instanceof and cast in a specific way can be considered "evil" because it is obscure and tricky, potentially leading to errors, and cannot be optimized by the JIT compiler, resulting in unnecessary extra method calls and code.

Now, I was told that using this castOrNull function in that way is an evil thing do to. It is an obscure and tricky way of doing something very simple. Obscure and tricky code is hard to read, hard to maintain, a potential source of errors (when someone doesn't understand it) and <em>therefore</em> evil. Unnecessary use of reflection is evil. Of course, "evil" is just another way of saying that you REALLY shouldn't do this. IMO, the "simple way" is better from both the readability and performance perspectives.

PostgreSQL stores interval values internally as months, days, and seconds. When an interval is calculated as a difference between two timestamps, it is always displayed in hours. However, calculations on intervals can result in non-standard formats. The `justify_hours` function is used to standardize interval formats, but a reverse function is needed to handle cases where intervals have different signs for date and time parts. The `unjustify_hours` function is proposed as a solution to convert a date part of an interval to hours.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When an interval is <strong>a difference between two timestamps</strong> <strong>Calculations on intervals</strong> are executed on date part and time part separately, so they may lead to strange formats. However they did not think that the reverse operation would be needful. In this answer I proposed a function to convert a date part of an interval to hours. Per the documentation:

According to the SQL standard all fields of an interval value must
  have the same sign, so a leading negative sign applies to all fields;
  for example the negative sign in the interval literal '-1 2:03:04'
  applies to both the days and hour/minute/second parts. PostgreSQL
  allows the fields to have different signs, and traditionally treats
  each field in the textual representation as independently signed, so
  that the hour/minute/second part is considered positive in this
  example. and

Internally interval values are stored as months, days, and seconds.

To get started in modern game programming and application programming, consider familiarizing yourself with various specialties such as game physics, AI, graphics, sound, and UI programming. Utilize open-source engines like OGRE 3D to develop a medium-sized game and gain experience in multiple areas. Consider taking math courses, building a portfolio of small games, and starting as a tools programmer to break into the industry.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Modern game programming is tremendously complex as a whole Modern games are usually too complicated and large for one person to have a detailed and in-depth knowledge of the entire process. Recently, for my Computer Graphics course in College we used the open source OGRE 3D engine. Develop a medium sized game using it and you will get a good taste of many of the above mentioned game programming specialties. I've often heard and read articles surrounding the industry talking about the long hours, the crunch time, the unpaid overtime and the relatively lower pay when compared to other types of programming. Game programming is one area where Math is used extensively in several phases of development. Most of the articles I have read involving the industry suggest that someone with no professional experience looking to get break into gaming should put together a portfolio of small games you have written demonstrating your abilities.

SQL Server 2005 Full Text Search over multiple tables and columns can be challenging due to the complexity of user input. Without knowing the user's intent, the best approach is to OR the terms and take the highest ranking hits. However, this may not always produce the desired results. A better solution would be to redesign the GUI to separate input into name and address, or enforce a syntax rule to distinguish between name and address terms. Otherwise, the query would need to handle multiple scenarios with varying numbers of terms, joining and merging results accordingly.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This is more of a syntax problem. Without knowing the user's intent, the best you can hope for is to OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits. etc...
I guess I would redesign the GUI to separate the input into Name and Address, at a minimum. If that is not possible, enforce a syntax rule to the effect "First words will be considered a name until a comma appears, any words after that will be considered addresses"
<strong> EDIT:</strong>
Your best bet is still OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits. This is less than ideal, here's what you get for the example (in your case, you would have wanted John Doe from Hamburg to show up first): But that is the best you can do without parsing the input before submitting it to SQL to make a "best guess" at what the user wants.

To sanity check a date in Java, create a SimpleDateFormat object with the desired pattern, attempt to parse the user-entered date with it, and then compare the reformatted date with the original value.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
An alternative strict solution using the standard library is to perform the following:
1) Create a strict SimpleDateFormat using your pattern
2) Attempt to parse the user entered value using the format object
3) If successful, reformat the Date resulting from (2) using the same date format (from (1))
4) Compare the reformatted date against the original, user-entered value. If they're equal then the value entered strictly matches your pattern. This way, you don't need to create complex regular expressions - in my case I needed to support all of SimpleDateFormat's pattern syntax, rather than be limited to certain types like just days, months and years.

Ground truth:
So, you are not alone, and it doesn't seem to be a problem with your install <em>(I've tried 5.1.x, but as you highlighted, it should be the same for 5.0.x)</em>
Looking at the "<code>mysqldumpslow</code>" I have under Linux, it appears it is a Perl script ; and Perl is not often installed on a Windows machine. Well, after a bit more testing, when installing MySQL, it seems <strong>you have to select "Developpers Components &gt; Scripts, examples"</strong>, which is not installed by default (at least on windows) -- no need to reinstall everything : you can "modify" the installation, to add this option. In this directory, there are some scripts ; one of them is <strong>mysqldumpslow.pl</strong> ; which is what you are looking for ;-)
Now, you "just" have to get Perl installed and running on your machine (sorry, I've never installed Perl on windows ; but you can find some informations here) Hope this helps better than what I posted before !

Rails Async Active Job doesn't execute code, while inline does, due to how rake tasks are set up to handle concurrent-ruby and the nature of in-process queuing.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With the advent of concurrent-ruby, rake tasks aren't set up to handle this. If the process crashes or the machine is reset,
  then all outstanding jobs are lost with the default async back-end. So, if you're doing any sort of data changes, rake tasks won't be open long enough to run a job, which is why they run <code>:inline</code> just fine, but not <code>:async</code>. It's why it works fine with <code>:sidekiq</code> or <code>:resque</code>, because those applications keep the job information in memory and do not release when the rake task is over. locally, there's not much you can do other than run tasks as <code>:inline</code> if you're local until rake (as a task runner) understands how to stay open while asynchronous tasks have been launched (or not). As a development only feature, this isn't really high priority, but, if you're bashing your head on the table not understanding why <code>:async</code> by default tasks that run jobs won't actually run, that's why.

Question: How to make sense of this scala stacktrace?
Answer: A Scala stacktrace decomposes into three parts: "Subject", "Verb", and "Object". The "Subject" describes the method causing the error, the "Verb" states the problem, and the "Object" explains why the error occurred, in this case, a method was called with incorrect arguments.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
So the whole first part is the subject, aka a description of what is concerned by the error. This subject is indeed the <code>overloaded method value split</code> followed by a reminder of the different valid signatures for this mehod. Don't search for what you did wrong here, it's only a description of the object concerned by the error ! The verb gives you the problem, it "cannot be applied". The object gives you the why : you called it with no arguments, and this doesn't match any of the valid signatures which you were reminded of in the "Subject" part.

Avoid using GHC-specific features in code, especially for open-source or work projects, to ensure standards-compliance and portability across different compilers.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
GHC is definitely pervasive - I think its the most-used Haskell compiler, so it probably won't cause too much trouble. You should always try to write standards-compliant code, though - maybe not for personal projects, but for OSS or work ones, definitely. With OSS, different people use different compilers - HUGS is also quite common, for example.

Better isolation, separate db's and inter-app communication through web APIs (SOA) and you don't have to worry about that. At any rate, having separate apps sets you up for SOA but you don't have to jump beyond a single db to start.

To open a "nul" file, you simply specify <code>"nul"</code> when you call <code>CreateFile</code>. It only looks weird because hardly anyone ever uses that file name. It's perfectly valid, though. But if you've found that <code>Invalid_Handle_Value</code> works, too, then go ahead and use that instead.

To pass a class of objects between two views in Three20, override the `-didSelectObject:atIndexPath:` method and build a custom `TTURLAction` with the desired object in the `query` dictionary. Alternatively, use a category to automatically add the `userInfo` property of the table item to the URL query.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The big problem with directly using <code>TTURLAction</code> is that you can't really use them with <code>TTTableViewItem</code>. The only way to really do it is override <code>-didSelectObject:atIndexPath:</code> and build your custom <code>TTURLAction</code> with your desired object in the <code>query</code> dictionary. But this breaks the nice separation of Model and View Controller, and gets complicated once you have multiple objects to pass. Instead of this, I've been using a small category which automatically takes the <code>userInfo</code> property of the table item (which I set to whatever I need), and automatically adds it as a URL parameter.

To block access to a subdirectory in Nginx when the subdirectory name is unknown, use the following configuration:

- Create a regular expression location to match any unknown subdirectory under '/users/public/' and return a 404 error.
- Create a common location to block access to the '/users/' directory.

Note: This configuration uses the '^~' modifier to skip regular expression checks for the '/users/' location, ensuring it takes precedence over the regular expression location.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Read the official docs to see difference between the modifier before the uri, You first location is a regular expression location and should use <code>~</code> or <code>*~</code> for case-sensitive and case-insensitive matches. A location can either be defined by a prefix string, or by a regular expression. Then your second location is a common location defined by a prefix string <code>/users/</code>, the modifier <code>^~</code> you use means skip the regular expression check and use the current longest matching prefix, here is the <code>/users/</code> one, so with your config you will always get a 403 return. If the longest matching prefix location has the “^~” modifier then regular expressions are not checked.

First, to explain the error message: you can't use <code>filter</code> in your definition, since Similarly <code>filter</code> returns a Prelude list of something, but the signature requires that it return a <code>List</code> of something.

To add a filename column when using Pentaho's CSV input, use the Text File Input step instead, which provides more options, including adding a field for the filename.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
but you probably will want to use the <strong>Text File Input</strong> step to parse your CSV file, rather than the <strong>CSV Input</strong> which is a subset of options from the Text File Input with some performance advantages for delimited files. With <strong>Text File Input</strong> there are a lot more options available to you for reading the file. Using this step would solve your problem because in the <em>Additional output fields</em> tab you can specify a field in the stream to put your filename, extension, file path, etc. The advantages you gain when using the <strong>CSV Input</strong> are: If you need those advantages then you'll have to get at your file name another way, such as passing it as a named parameter and adding it to the stream with the Get Variables step.

In a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), "Activations" refer to the output of an activation function, which is a function that takes input and outputs a value based on a threshold. "Activation Gradients" are the slopes of these activation functions, showing areas where the network is focusing. "Weights" are the values that determine how much each input is amplified, and "Weight Gradients" are the slopes of the cost-weight curve, indicating the error or loss value.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
An activation function is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some "threshold" (this is specific for each different activation function). This comes from how neurons work, where they take some electrical input and will only activate if they reach some threshold. A gradient is essentially the slope of the activation function. This article may clear up some confusion on weights and activation functions. The "max activation" and "min activation" values make sense for a ReLu: the minimum value will be zero and the max is whatever the maximum value is.

To save memory space while still allowing for automatic filename incrementing, store a counter as an integer and implement a method to generate the next filename.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I think you should just store the counter in an int. I understand that you want to save memory space but to be honest, an extra int is really in the "acceptable" category. <strong>EDIT</strong>: You probably want to have a method like GetNextFileName() in your class that generates you the next filename (being able to refactor your code into small bits is important, much more important than saving memory space):

Here's a concise summary:

To structure a large Rails app, it's best to bundle all components into a single app to avoid memory consumption and duplication of classes. Use subdomain routing (e.g., subdomain_fu) to handle different roots for subdomains, such as `logs.mysite.com` and `mysite.com`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would bundle this all into the same app because you won't be duplicating the classes (models, plugins, etc.) across all the apps. Also: running 4 apps means that you'll have 4 processes all consuming memory due to the 4 separate Rails stacks they have loaded. Compiling it into one application eliminates this issue. For the issue between the sales site and the users site having to have different roots that can be solved, as mentioned earlier, by subdomain_fu. Lastly, compiling it all into one mega-super-hyper-app will eliminate the database-sharing issues.

Generated abstractive summary:
Java singleton patterns have a limitation that makes them difficult to test, specifically when testing dependencies that rely on the singleton. This limitation arises from the static binding of the singleton instance, making it challenging to replace it with a mock object during testing.

Extractive summary:
For example if you want to test <code>PrintingService</code> class that depends on <code>PrintingSingleton</code> you will not be able to replace this printing singleton with a mock because it is bound statically.

Ground truth:
All Java singleton patterns (both this and the standard with private constructor and static accessor) have this bad property that if you to test them (or test anything that even remotely depends on them) can use this and only this object. For example if you want to test <code>PrintingService</code> class that depends on <code>PrintingSingleton</code> you will not be able to replace this printing singleton with a mock because it is bound statically. Personally, I would just avoid using singletons that way but rather introduce dependency injection, via Guice, Spring or Pico Container. That way you ensure existence of only one object, while not limiting yourself to not being able to mock the object out for example for tests.

A custom `JsonSerializer` in Gson is causing a recursive loop, resulting in a `StackOverflowError`. This is because the serializer is passing the object back to the `JsonSerializationContext`, which then delegates back to the serializer, creating an infinite loop.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The point of a <code>JsonSerializer</code> is to serialize the fields of an Object, not the object itself. However, you are passing the object you've already told <code>Gson</code> to serialize. which I hope you can see is going into recursive loop. But your <code>JsonSerializer</code> will send it back to the <code>JsonSerializationContext</code> and the loop goes on.

Generated abstractive summary:
When building a web spider, recursion may seem suitable but can lead to an endless cycle if pages link to each other in a loop. A non-recursive approach with a list of unique links is recommended for retrieving all links.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Recursion seems to be appropriate - until you think a bit more about it. you're stuck in an endless cycle. Recursion is not any more CPU intensive than doing it in a "normal" way. You have to ask yourself whether you need all the links or if it's suffice to only grab links down to a certain level. In the latter case this also solves your endless cycle problem.

In well-written Java code, instanceof and casts are generally not needed due to the use of generics. However, they may still occur in some cases.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In most well written/designed Java code the use of instanceof and casts never happens. With the addition of generics many cases of casts (and thus instanceof) are not needed. The biggest problem when changing from one language to another is adopting the conventions of the new language. Generally speaking casts are "evil" in Java because they are usually not needed. Your method is more "evil" because it is not written in the way most people would expect Java to be written.

### Example
Question: VS2010 (Express) debugger trapping Ctrl+C in Console app
Answer: 

To prevent the VS2010 Express debugger from trapping Ctrl+C in a Console app, go to Debug -> Exceptions, and check the "Win32 Exceptions" option, specifically "Control-C". However, this option is missing in VS2010 Express editions.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I found the answer, it is a debugging Exception option. I don't know how I missed it the first time, but here it is:
Debug -&gt; exist in the Express editions (the entire Win32 Exceptions node is missing). So the only question I have left, since I don't own VS2010 Pro (yet?) is: Does the Win32 Exceptions node, and the Control-C exception exist in the VS2010 Pro edition?

It is not recommended to call the class that created you due to tight coupling, but there are alternative solutions to achieve the desired functionality, including passing data between classes, using inheritance, or moving the method to the child class.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I think what you call a parent-child relationship is just a composition (the 'parent' holds an instance of an unrelated in the hierarchy class, the 'child'). If my assumption is correct, then this smells bad because the two classes would be tightly coupled and that points to bad design somewhere (the 'parent', the 'child' or both). Less smelly alternatives:

Due to the lack of covariance of generic types, a conversion from IQueryable<Tax> to IQueryable<ITax> is not possible. However, a workaround is to use the Cast method: `return db.Taxes.Cast<ITax>();`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
We don't have covariance of generic types yet, I'm afraid. You can do <code>IQueryable&lt;Tax&gt;</code>, but not <code>IQueryable&lt;ITax&gt;</code>. You could introduce a conversion, but it'll probably break composability, rendering it useless.

To map classes in NHibernate using roles or composition, consider defining a Person class with common properties and a Role superclass with sub-classes for specific roles (e.g., DoctorRole, PatientRole, EmployeeRole). Use an Association class (e.g., PeopleRole) or define a one-to-many relationship between Person and Role classes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You probably want to consider using the Roles. This would probably imply that there is an Association class that maps persons to roles. Define a Person class with all properties that are common to people. Then define a Role super class and DoctorRole, PatientRole and EmployeeRole sub classes (Assuming that each role has different properties). The Person class can have a Collection of roles defined and the Role class can have a Collection of people defined. This page explains how to do the mapping so that PeopleRole is a composite element. Your Person is like Order, PeopleRole is like LineItem and Role is like Product.

The ternary operator (?:) offers improved readability in decision trees with complex conditions, allowing for chained decisions to be expressed in a single line of code, making it a more concise alternative to traditional if-else blocks.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The real difference is that it selects a final result. Really, just syntactic sugar that improves readability. It can be argued that it is just a matter of style, thus subjective. But, the legibility becomes even greater when you have a more complex decision tree, such as: You can chain together many decisions in one place instead of writing a bunch of nested if-then-else clauses: This is somewhat following a code pattern called method chaining.

Creating a Calendar object is relatively slow and complex due to handling date/time intricacies, making it less economical than using the Date object for getting a date in string format.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Creating a Calendar object is a relatively slow and complex action, it has to compensate for all the oddities that are inherent to dates and times such as timezones, daylight savings etc. Your best bet is to use the Date object as your first example, see here for a comparison on performance metrics of Date, Calendar and SimpleDateFormat. Whilst the difference between Java Date and JodaTime is probably negligible in performance terms, JodaTime is generally agreed to be a better way of handling dates and times. For your purpose, importing JodaTime just for a timestamp may well be overkill though.

Ground truth:
By default Firebird uses a random port for events. This doesn't work well with firewalls, so Firebird also offers an option to use a fixed port, using the <code>RemoteAuxPort</code> setting in <code>firebird.conf</code>. This is where the problem becomes evident: the client tries to connect to that port (6023) on the firewall (as it “sees” the firewall as a server). Since the port is completely random, there are certainly no forwarding rules for that port on the firewall, so connection is denied.

AutoCloseable in Java is not required, but it is recommended for use with the try-with-resources statement (introduced in Java 7). Implementing AutoCloseable allows for cleaner and shorter code, as the close method is called implicitly.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Is it important to implement autoCloseable in java? But it is not required. It is OK to do that. AutoCloseable was added from Java 7. It is designed to use with new try-with-resources statement (Java 7+)
See two below classes providing the same functionality. Using AutoClosble will make the code shorter and cleaner.

The issue arises because the browser adds a `<tbody>` tag around the table's content, making `children('tr')` return 0. To fix this, use `find('tr')` instead.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This line is returning 0: Because the browser adds a <code>tbody</code> tag around the contents of the table, so there are really no <code>tr</code> elements which are children/direct descendands of the table. That's why this returns 0.

NSTableView's unhideRowsAtIndexes:withAnimation: method crashes due to an AppKit bug in macOS versions prior to 10.13. A workaround is to implement variable row heights or use the code snippet provided, which checks for macOS version and handles the unhideRowsAtIndexes:withAnimation: method accordingly.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You were right! It's an AppKit bug. This has been fixed for all applications on macOS 10.13. If you are targeting an older OS, it is recommended to use "variable row heights" by implementing -tableView:heightOfRow: and returning the desired row height; this will work around the bug with hidden row indexes. This has been fixed for all applications on macOS 10.13. I thought I should post an answer so other folks struggling with this issue are aware of the bug.

To model classes in NHibernate using roles or composition, consider separating the identity of a participant from the role they play in an activity, using objects like Person, Student, and Tutor, each with its own distinct information and references to related objects.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It seems to me that this is more a question around how to model a domain well, rather than an NHibernate mapping issue. Once you've sorted out your domain modelling, I think you'll find the NHibernate mapping falls out relatively easily. One place to look to get your head around the idea of modeling Roles is to look for "Color Modeling" - Jeff de Luca has some resources, though the idea originated with Peter Coad
The basic idea is to separate the identity of a participant from the role they play in an activity. This structure gives you great flexibility - one person (Joe Bloggs) may just be a student, another person (Jane Doe) may just be a tutor, and a third (Chuck Norris) may be both. Also, introducing another role (Lecturer, Marker, Administrator) becomes easier because the additions don't require changes to existing objects.

Cannot use polymorphism because of generic base class: The problem arises when using a generic base class, as it can inherit from itself and be used in a circular scenario. To solve this, move the type parameter from the class to the factory method and restrict its usage to the base class type. This allows derived classes to inherit from the base class while still creating instances of the derived types using the factory method.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
you're using Derived1 in two different ways according to the base class. This is not wrong (if that's what you really want), but it's unusual for most programming scenarios; you normally choose one or the other. However the benefit of your logic is: not only do you have an implicit instance of Derived1 through inheritance (same for any other derived class), but the base class can <em>also</em> handle other external instances of that same derived type through the type parameter <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> One Solution...
One possible (and strong solution) is to move the Type parameter from the class to the factory Create method and restrict its usage to the Base class type like so: Your factory method is restricted to create only instances of derived types.

To structure a large Rails app, it's recommended to keep everything in a single application and use roles for user filtering and access control, rather than separating into multiple apps. Consider using authorization frameworks like declarative_authorization or cancan for easier management.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The biggest issue I see with separating into several apps is that you lose flexibility. I'd keep everything on single application - and use roles for filtering what each user can see and do. It might be a bit more difficult at the begining, but it pays up in the near future.

Local variables in Magento use an underscore prefix as a coding convention to indicate they are loosely coupled with an object and not exclusively owned by the view.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
No certain answer here, but I believe it's just an internal magento team coding convention. I'm sure you're aware of the underscore prefix's history in programming in general. It's not too much of a stretch to think that 

local variables used in a view script that are loosely coupled with an object are similar to private or protected variables  

In other words, the underscore serves as a warning that 

hey, the contents of this variable doesn't just belong to this view, it's owned by something else  

Part of the problem is there's no "official" recommendations from Zend, or anyone else, what sort of naming conventions should be used in phtml files.

To detect collisions between a rectangle and a wall in Matlab, use the `polyxpoly` function from the Mapping Toolbox to find the intersection of the rectangle and the wall. 

The example code provided demonstrates a full working example of collision detection with one wall, checking if the rectangle intersects with the wall and displaying "GAME OVER" if there is an intersection.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If you have the Mapping Toolbox installed, it provides a function called <code>polyxpoly</code> that allows you to intersect polylines, so you can find the intersection of the whole rectangle against every wall, and you will not have to worry about splitting every edge of the rectangle. Here you have a full working example of a collision with one wall: You can try with different positions of the bird to test the collision detection:

To schedule actions at various timings from a list in Python, use the `viztask.schedule()` function, which allows you to yield and wait for a specific time before performing an action.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
busfault is correct about your use of the FOR loop. To test it using <code>yield</code>, you need to <code>schedule</code> the called function. You'll find that the timing mismatch is usually related to your frame rate ( 60 Hz ~ 16.7ms) Following edit by OP:
.. an easy way to test if the timing differences are due to the frame syncing is to turn off Vertical sync (V-Sync) for your graphics card and re-run it - I suspect you'll get much better timings, however you might get frame tearing on your display  - then it's your call as to what is more important to you, image quality or timing accuracy. I notice you've gone back to using time.time() - this will be LESS accurate than using the return object from waitTime as per my demo  (ie <code>mydata = yield viztask.waitTime( cuetime)</code> ... )

Implementing AutoCloseable in Java is beneficial for classes with a close operation, as it allows use of try-with-resource syntax and is inexpensive.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There's no problem in having a class implement <code>AutoClosable</code> even if it's super class doesn't. If your class has some semantic of <code>close</code>ing it, you should probably have it implement <code>AutoClosable</code>. It costs almost nothing to do so, if at all, and it allows you to use Java 7's neat syntactic sugaring of the try-with-resource syntax.

There is no "units" in GridBagLayout; components are sized by their cell. To ignore component PreferredSize, consider using the "weightx" constraint for proportional space allocation or a RelativeLayout to specify relative sizes, allowing you to ignore the preferred size.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is no such concept as "units" in GridBagLayout. A GBL uses cells. Each component will originally be sized at its preferred size. If you want truly relative sizes then you can use the Relative Layout. It allows you to specify the size of components relative to the total space available, so the preferred size can be ignored.

I'd use that.

Ground truth:
This will allow <code>1000 / 4</code> numbers or <code>250</code>. Another bug: You were never filling the first element of <code>array</code>. Another [minor] bug is that you're relying on <code>$t2</code> to have a zero value without explicitly setting it. Here's the cleaned up code. I added a limit check on the user's count Printing the array is similar to the input of the array. I've reworked the previous example code. I removed the hardwired limit value of 250 in favor of using a new label: <code>arrend</code> [so, have a look]
Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array.

To break the game when objects collide in Matlab, use an intersection algorithm to check if the rectangle intersects with the wall lines, and apply a line-line intersection algorithm to find the intersection points.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You'd want to use an intersection algorithm to check whether there is an intersection of one of the wall-lines (check it four times) with the rectangle. The rectangle basically also consists of 4 lines, that means you should check the 4 rectangle-lines against the four wall-lines (if you use a line-line-intersection algorithm).

To reference other classes in C++, you need to compile and link all the source files. A sample Makefile and test code are provided to demonstrate this. The Makefile uses the GNU compiler and takes advantage of automatic variables like $@ and $^ to simplify the compilation process.

There is still an error in your post - a missing <code>;</code> after the <code>DriverClass</code>

The placement of conditions in a SQL Server LEFT OUTER JOIN affects the result. Conditions in the ON clause preserve the driving table rows with NULLs for non-matched rows in the slave table, while conditions in the WHERE clause filter out non-matched rows.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Left Outer Join - ON clause vs WHERE clause</strong>
For a left outer join, for the same condition, there is a big difference depending on where it is placed - the join clause or the where clause. As expected, all rows from driving table with NULLs for no match from slave table. <strong>Condition in ON clause</strong> Here, the columns of the driving table is preserved but the join clause NULLs the non-matched row(s) in the slave table. <strong>Condition in WHERE clause</strong> This gives only the matched row(s) because the where clause filters out all rows that do not match the conditions which are applied after the join clause on a row by row basis.

Ground truth:
Your approach is okey, couple of things to check:
1) Each Data View Web Part has the DataFields tag, it looks like this: Make sure your new field is displayed in this list. 2) Also there is difference between internal field name and field name. In the example above <strong>Comments</strong> is internal name but name is <strong>Notes</strong>. So to display Notes field correctly you should use: 3) Make sure you are trying to output this value in the right place of XSLT template. The easiest way to find the place is to look for existing fields and just add the new one along these.

The problem is that there's no such class as Class (and as a side note, this nonexistent class also doesn't respond to <code>classNamed:</code>). It's not quite clear whether you want to <em>create</em> a class or get a <em>reference</em> to a class. If the latter, you want the function <code>NSClassFromString()</code>.

Here's a concise summary:

The error occurs because `params[:name_ids]` is a nested hash, not an array of IDs. To fix this, use `params[:name_ids].keys` to get an array of IDs. Additionally, the line `name.update_attributes!(params[:name].reject { |k,v| v.blank? })` is incorrect because `params[:name]` is `nil`. Instead, use `params[:name_ids][name.id.to_s].reject { |k,v| v.blank? }` to update the attributes for the corresponding name.

Extractive summary:
EDIT (brief-ish explanation):
What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids].

Ground truth:
Likely you need to get just the keys from the name_ids hash. A separate problem is your reference to params[:name], which is nil. EDIT (brief-ish explanation):
What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids]. An ActiveRecord 'find' method can take an array of ids, but not a hash of values. There was no value ':name' in params, so calling 'reject' on it cause the 'no method' error -- there is no 'reject' method on the nil object. What you wanted was to update the attributes for the 'name' that corresponded to the particular name in the loop. meant that params would contain a hash called 'name_ids', with keys corresponding to name.id, that themselves would contain hashes of attributes that ActiveRecord could use in the update_attributes method.

To prevent losing SVN history during file refactoring, use a version control client like AnkhSVN or VisualSVN to track file renames.

Extractive summary:
If you rename files without using the subversion client (using windows explorer or visual studio solution explorer instead of TortoiseSVN or AnkhSVN), then subversion won't recognise the rename operation (only a delete and an add operation).

Ground truth:
You could install the (free) visual studio add-in AnkhSVN. This will track your file-renames and you won't lose the history in subversion. If you rename files without using the subversion client (using windows explorer or visual studio solution explorer instead of TortoiseSVN or AnkhSVN), then subversion won't recognise the rename operation (only a delete and an add operation). BTW: using AnkhSVN gives you some other advantages, such as the displaying the subversion status of files directly in the solution explorer. Alternatively there's also VisualSVN, which is comparable to AnkhSVN, but is commercial.

To summarize the answer, the system can be implemented with either two or three tables for articles, tags, and their relationships. The search function can be done using "like" with wildcards, regex, or full-text search, depending on the desired results. Joining tables will not significantly impact performance, and the actual data can be retrieved and then filtered on the application side.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Q1 - you're better off with three separate tables for articles, tags, and a link table relating articles and tags. You could also do it with two tables for articles and an articles_tags table. Either two or three tables makes it easy to find which articles have a given tag and which tags are assigned to a given article. Q2 - title and description searches could be done using "like" with percents or with regex or full text search. Q3 - don't worry about joining the tags tables with the others. Q4 - It depends what you want to get out of the results. Q5 - again, you'd have to use "like" syntax and maybe some creative regex on the PHP side before the query is handed off to the database.

Ground truth:
The contract of <code>in.available()</code> does not guarantee anything. It is never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream. Your code basically rely on / assume that all data sent, will be available immediately and reported accordingly by <code>in.available()</code>. To make sure you get all data, you could, on the sender side, start by sending an integer, telling how many bytes will be sent: You could for instance use <code>str.getBytes("UTF-8")</code> and <code>new String(bytes, "UTF-8")</code> to be sure the receiver interprets the bytes the way the sender intended.

The issue with Process.Start() throwing "No application is associated" for .DOC files is likely due to a broken file association on the system.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would suspect that the file association on your system is somewhat broken. </li>

It might be that there is no <em>Advanced</em> button on the <em>File Types</em> dialog when DOC is selected, and that instead a <em>Restore</em> button is present. This is the case if a user has manually changed the file association using the <em>Open With...</em> option from the context menu of .doc files. Try if clicking on restore solves your problem.

The answer emphasizes the difference between local variables and object creation in terms of memory usage.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
"least amount of memory" is NOT equals to "no or little variables"
Local variables only takes little memory itself. But object creation in heap takes a lot more, and they require GC to do cleanup. In your example, your ToCharArray() and ToString() have created 4 object (indirect created object not included).

Client customizations can be implemented by using a generic application and customer-specific configuration files in a text format (e.g. XML). This allows for easy management and customization of various customer versions.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would be tempted to arrange things so that customization is in text-form (possibly XML, but I guess that's not the only option), and the main application is generic, and gets the customer specific features by parsing those configuration files. You could then have a repository for each customer, containing configuration files (and possibly resources, like logos, and/or custom scripts), and a repository for the main application. For a given customer version, your build system then automatically gathers the application and the customer's repository, and builds the custom version. It makes things a little bit more complex on the application side at first, because you need to add parsing functionality, but it makes management of various customer versions a lot simpler, and somewhat less error prone.

Generated abstractive summary:
To maintain cache state across different servers, consider using consistent hashing, which maps keys to specific servers, minimizing data replication and disruption when servers are added or removed.

Extractive summary:
The "consistent" part of consistent hashing, refers to how your hashing function handles new servers being added to or removed from the cluster: some re-distribution of keys between servers is required, but the function is designed to minimize the amount of such disruption.

Ground truth:
If you ultimately decide to move the cache outside your main webserver process, then you could also take a look at consistent hashing. This would be a alternative to a replicated cache. The problem with replicated caches, is they scale inversely proportional to the number of nodes participating in the cache. So each caching server is responsible for a fraction of the overall keys, the client can determine which server will contain the sought data without any lookup, and data and eviction messages do not need to be replicated between caching servers. Consistent hashing is used at large scale.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Yes, it is perfectly legal. In most situations the declaration on f() in B doesn't change the meaning of the program in any way, but there's nothing wrong with a little redundancy. Recall that the "= 0" means only that the class may not be instantiated directly; that all pure virtual function must be overridden before an object can be instantiated. You can even provide a definition for a pure virtual function, which can be called on an instance of a subclass. By explicitly declaring B::f(), you leave open the option of giving a definition for B::f().

SQL Server query with multiple LEFT OUTER JOIN and WHERE conditions:

Ground truth:
No DB engine would interpret the queries the same unless you have some kind of ANSI NULLS switch confusing the issue in your 2005 DB.

Valgrind reports memory leaks in the program due to two reasons: 

1. GLib's slab memory allocator, GSlice, which confuses Valgrind, can be turned off by setting the environment variable G_SLICE=always-malloc.
2. Static memory allocated by GTK and its underlying libraries at startup is not freed until the program quits, which Valgrind incorrectly reports as a leak.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You're not doing anything wrong. GTK widgets use reference counting, but in your programme all the references are taken care of, so you're not (manually) leaking anything. Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, Valgrind will still report that your app leaks memory. The reason for this is that GTK (and its underlying libraries) allocate some "static" memory at start-up that doesn't get freed until the programme quits. This isn't really a problem, because typically the programme ends as soon as <code>gtk_main()</code> returns, and then the OS frees any remaining resources, so you're not <em>really</em> leaking anything. Valgrind thinks you are though, and for this reason it would be nice to have a <code>gtk_deinit()</code> function, but sadly there isn't one. The best you can do instead is to teach Valgrind to ignore these things, via a suppressions file.

Ground truth:
This represents whether or not the entity can be audited. As a general rule normal entities can be audited, while certain system entities and bridge entities for N:N relationships cannot be audited. This represents whether or not auditing has been turned on for the entity. If IsAudited = 0 then there will be no audit records in the AuditBase table for that entity.

Is your path index a <code>string</code> type or a number (<code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, etc.) I wouldn't expect this to work at all with strings, but maybe it is, and I don't see you passing a option to set the type to a number (<code>("any", "type=double")</code>). If <code>sum-aggregate</code> does work over string indexes (and I don't see anything in the documentation to suggest otherwise), that could explain why the duplicate value is only counted once.

To use a try-with-resources statement in Java, implement the AutoCloseable interface with a close method that can throw an exception.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
From the documentation:

void close()
           throws Exception
Closes this resource, relinquishing any underlying resources. This method is invoked automatically on objects managed by the try-with-resources statement. So if you want the new class to be automagically closed in a try-with-resources statement, you could thus add that functionality to your <code>ICannotBeClosed</code> class.

To summarize the question and answer:

AutoCloseable in Java is an interface that allows an object's resources to be automatically closed when used in a try-with-resources statement. Implementing it is only necessary if using this feature.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>AutoCloseable</code> is an interface that essentially allows an object's resources to be closed automatically when using it in a try-with-resources statement. If you don't plan on using your object with try-with-resources, there is no need to implement it at all. If you want to auto-close resources in your child class, go right ahead.

Generated abstractive summary:
The original code had a pointer reset issue, but the provided solution fixes it by using a simpler approach. 

Instead of using a pointer `nR` and a reset address `nRreset`, the code can be simplified by using the variable `j` to index the `newResBuffer` array, eliminating the need for a pointer reset. 

Additionally, the code can be further simplified by using `atoi()` to convert the string buffer to an integer, replacing the use of `sscanf()`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your method of resetting the pointer is correct, although there are some easier ways to achieve it. I assume that your error must be somehow related setting the MAXCNT register or reading new data from the receive register. I tested your code by replacing the Raspberry Pi specific register usage with standard C functions for reading from stdin and printing to <code>stdout</code>. It's easy to test and see that the part of the code that involves receiving an individual char digit, storing it in a string buffer, converting that buffer to an int, and reusing the buffer, are all correct. <strong>19432</strong>
  MAXCNT: 38863
  nR address before reset: <strong>0x10779f065</strong>
  nR address after reset: <strong>0x10779f060</strong> 

I mentioned earlier that there are some easier ways for you to reset the pointer. You can actually do it without using <code>nRreset</code>; since the base address for <code>newResBuffer</code> never changes, you can simply reset it with <code>nR = newResBuffer</code>. An even easier way to do it would be not to use a moving pointer at all and simply use the variable <code>j</code> You can also use <code>atoi()</code> or <code>strtol()</code> instead of <code>sscanf()</code> to convert the string buffer to an <code>int</code> (or <code>long</code>).

To fix ValueError: too many values to unpack in Python, ignore extra values by using `_` as a wildcard in the assignment.

Ground truth:
If you only care about the first 3 items, and want to ignore the rest, you could probably do: Needless to say that if the right operand unpacks in less than 3 items, you'll still get an error.

Ground truth:
You are mixing concepts. If you want to enforce git-flow and prevent direct commits to the develop and master branches, you need to use a git-repository-management-software that supports such feature.

Bare repositories are used for specific use cases, but in normal development, you wouldn't use them.

Disconnecting signals and related monkey-patching in Django code should ideally be done in the `ready()` method of the `AppConfig` class.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would say yes, but I think there is no clear right or wrong here, with regards to connecting signals, the Django docs state the following:

Strictly speaking, signal handling and registration code can live
  anywhere you like, although it’s recommended to avoid the
  application’s root module and its models module to minimize
  side-effects of importing code. In practice, signal handlers are usually defined in a signals
  submodule of the application they relate to. My opinion is that if the recommended way to connect signals is to do it in the <code>ready()</code> method of your <code>AppConfig</code>, disconnecting signals and related monkeypatching should also be done in this method. Write some sort of unit tests or integration tests to ensure that my code does what I want it to do, even when updating dependencies etc.

To find vulnerabilities in code, use a combination of tools and techniques, including a compiler with high warning levels, static and dynamic source code analyzers, and manual analysis of control and data flows, particularly for functions like scanf() that can have multiple possible outcomes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
How can I find vulnerabilities in this code? With experience, a good set of compiler options, a static source code analyzer, a dynamic analyzer, ... anything you know how to use. If you don't know how to use such, I'm afraid that you have to learn. You can find the worst problems by raising the warning level of your compiler to the max and even give option like <code>-pedantic</code> for GCC. The same applies to the analyzers of which the static kind is quite simple to use. Then think about what will happen further down the control flow. Do this for every function call, every assignment, and every instruction. Yes, a lot of people know this.

A ZeroMQ multithreaded example crashes due to an unresolved live-lock caused by a non-blocking recv() call on a ZMQ_REP socket, which prevents the socket from entering a sendable state. To resolve this, use a blocking-form of recv() or a non-blocking poll() call before attempting to send().

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Welcome to the domain of the Zen-of-Zero
<strong>Suspect #1:</strong> the code jumps straight into an unresolveable live-lock due to a move into ill-directed state of the distributed-Finite-State-Automaton: While I since ever advocate for preferring non-blocking .<code>recv()</code>-s, the code above simply commits suicide right by using this step:
<strong><code>socket.recv( request, zmq::recv_flags::dontwait ); // socket being == ZMQ_REP</code></strong>
kills all chances for any other future life but the very error  <em><code>The zmq_send() operation cannot be performed on this socket at the moment due to the socket not being in the appropriate state.</code></em>
as
going into the <strong><code>.send()</code></strong>-able state is possible <strong>if and only if</strong> a previous <code>.recv()</code>-ed has delivered a real message. The Best Next Step :
Review the code and may either use a blocking-form of the <code>.recv()</code> before going to <code>.send()</code> or, better, use a { blocking | non-blocking }-form of <code>.poll( { 0 | timeout }, ZMQ_POLLIN )</code> before entering into an attempt to <code>.recv()</code> and keep doing other things, if there is nothing to receive yet ( so as to avoid the self suicidal throwing the dFSA into an uresolvable collision, flooding your <code>stdout/stderr</code> with a second-spaced flow of <code>printf(" ERROR: The Problem 1 :
On the contrary to the suicidal <code>::dontwait</code> flag in the Problem 2 root cause, the Problem 2 root cause is, that a blocking-form of the first <code>.recv()</code> here moves all the worker-threads into an undeterministically long, possibly infinite, waiting-state, as the <code>.recv()</code>-blocks proceeding to any further step until a real message arrives ( which it does not seem from the MCVE, that it ever will ) and so your pool-of-threads remains in a pool-wide blocked-waiting-state and nothing will ever happen until any message arrived. Update on how the <code>REQ/REP</code> works :
The <strong><code>REQ/REP</code></strong> The code is not a reproducible MCVE. Persevere, ZeroMQ took me some time of scratching my own head, yet the years after I took a due care to learn the Zen-of-Zero are still a rewarding eternal walk in the Gardens of Paradise. No localhost serial-code IDE will ever be able to "debug" a distributed-system (unless a distributed-inspector infrastructure is inplace, a due architecture for a distributed-system monitor/tracer/debugger is another layer of distributed messaging/signaling layer atop of the debugged distributed messaging/signaling system - so do not expect it from a trivial localhost serial-code IDE.

To access GNOME keyrings from Ruby, you can use the `keyring` or `gir_ffi-gnome_keyring` gem. The `keyring` gem allows you to set, get, and delete passwords in the default keyring, while `gir_ffi-gnome_keyring` provides more advanced functionality, including the ability to create and access keyrings other than the default one.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Unfortunately the <code>keyring</code> gem does not allow you to use anything other than the default keyring. To use other keyrings, or if you just want to cut out the middle-man: If the keyring is unlocked (which it probably will be, because by default it uses your login keyring which is automatically unlocked when you log in) then reads and writes will work without any issues. If the keyring is locked, then you will be prompted to supply a password to unlock the keyring, before any reading or writing can happen. Then you probably need to install the gnome-keyring headers (<code>apt install libgnome-keyring-dev</code>)

The issue with MVC 5 BeginCollectionItem Model Always Null is due to two main reasons:

1. The BeginCollectionItem method name does not match the collection property name.
2. Hidden inputs for each property are causing the DefaultModelBinder to ignore subsequent name/value pairs, only binding the initial values sent to the view.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your collection property is named <code>mylist</code> therefore you must pass that name to the <code>BeginCollectionItem</code> method However, you have other issues with your code. The <code>DefaultModelBinder</code> binds the first name/value pair matching a model property and ignores any subsequent name/value pairs with the same name. Because you have a hidden input for each property before the textbox, only the initial values you sent to the view will be bound when you submit, not the edited values. You including 2 inputs and a button, but that will not bind to your model and will not correctly add items to your collection (your add button needs to use ajax to call a server method that returns another partial view and append it to the DOM)

When sending a large amount of data to SQL Server, it may appear that nothing is happening due to the data being processed and sent to the server. Adjusting the command timeout, for example to 200 seconds, can help identify the issue.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When sending a large amount of data to Sql Server to be saved this is most likely what you are observing, it appears that nothing is happening when in fact this data has to be sent to the server and then processed and<code>500 MB</code> could take a while for that to happen. after 200 seconds due to a time out. If this is not desirable then you need to figure out good balance between time and batch size based on the amount of time it takes per XX MB. The only way you can measure that is by testing with various batch sizes as it is dependent on your environment (network capacity, sql server load, client load among other things).

To reset edited cells in a JTable to their previous state, consider using a HashMap to store the original values and track changes with a Table Cell Listener.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can just create a new TableModel using this data and reset the model of the table. However the problem is that you need two copies of the data.

one which doesn't require creating two identical data arrays. So you could keep a <code>HashMap</code> where the key is the row/column and the data is the original value. So on a "Cancel" you would just iterate through the <code>HashMap</code> and restore the data for each key found in the Map. You can use the Table Cell Listener to listen for changes to the TableModel.

There are several strategies for autocomplete algorithms, each with their own pros and cons. These include:

- **Brute Force**: Simple to implement but has the worst time complexity.
- **Trie (Prefixed Tree)**: Simple and efficient for small datasets, but has space limitations.
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Reduces space complexity by merging similar subpaths, but has its own trade-offs.
- **Other Tree options**: Variants like Radix Tree, Suffix Tree, Suggest Tree, and Merkle Tree may be useful, but come with their own trade-offs.
- **Prioritizing Offers**: Markov Chain can be used to prioritize next states, but requires understanding input topology.
- **Artificial Intelligence strategies**: Good models are small and fast, but require preprocessing and have long training times.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Can be used for time series problems, but has its own limitations.
- **Transformers**: Currently a game-changer, with models like Google BERT being highly promising for predicting future sequences.

Ground truth:
based on my knowledge, I list a short highlights of some of well known Auto Completion strategies and their corresponding data structures. also I tried to summarizing their major <em><strong>pros</strong></em> and <em><strong>cons</strong></em> related to <strong>Auto Completion</strong> problem. <strong>Brute Force</strong> : <strong>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</strong> :
Trie has space problem so other data structures main goal is reducing the space complexity. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is one of the options. linear search is the worst case option so most strategies improved their search time by using either sorting( <em>O(nlog(n)</em> ) and then using Binary search( <em>O(log(n)</em>) ) or using a hashtable ( <em>O(1)</em>, fast but has more space complexity). Prioritizig Offers</strong> :
Markov Chain can be used to prioritize next states. it stores connection probabilities which leads to more accurate results. <strong>Long short term memory (LSTM )</strong> :
there are so many useful Machine Learning and Deep Learning strategies. <strong>Transformers</strong> :
The last but not least, I recommend Transformer models. currently they are game changers.

There are two ways to handle WCF confirmations: return a value from the service call or use a callback to notify the client of success or failure.

Extractive summary:
There's 2 ways you could do this - return a value from your wcf call indicating success or failure, or assume success and use a callback to tell the client if there's a problem.

My preference would be to use a one-way service call with a duplex service and use a callback contract for the service to notify the client of a failure. I think you get a nicer, more asynchronous architecture if you follow the second path, but for simple applications just returning success or failure may be easier.

There is a potential problem with persisting long-running workflows in a database, where they cannot trigger events until reloaded. To resolve this, it's recommended to use an external service for asynchronous operations, separating the workflow's "why and when" from the implementation details.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
There is a potential problem here with regard to workflow persistence. And we have a catch 22 :-(
The proper way to do this is using an external service. The reason is that the workflow is responsible for the big picture, IE what should be done. That way you can change the how without changing the why and when part.

If your project is a little bit bigger it makes sense to have a service that handles the complete workflow for order fullfillment including confirmation of payments. In our service we dont wait for notification of payment providers, but activily pull this data. Whatever way you go, always take into account that payment providers will be offline at some point. This should not affect your web application or order fullfillment service.

To override the `reversed` function in Python 2.5, implement the sequence protocol by adding `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods to your custom class. Alternatively, you can create a custom `reversed` function that treats your class differently, but this is not recommended.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Creating a custom <code>__reversed__</code> is only possible since 2.6, so you can't simply implement that and have <code>reversed</code> working in 2.5. In 2.5 and below, you can however make your custom class still working with <code>reversed</code> by implementing the sequence protocol (i.e. implement both <code>__len__</code> and <code>__getitem__</code>). However, I wouldn't recommend that as it changes the normal behaviour of built-in functions (obviously) and might confuse other users.. So you should rather implement the sequnce protocol to make <code>reversed</code> working.

To design a keyboard input routine for a 9-key keyboard, it should handle key presses and releases, update the cursor position, and confirm entry when the enter key is pressed.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
To do a really good design, you'll need a keyboard input routine which can tell when keys have been held for awhile, and when they have been released for awhile. For a short time after a digit is pressed, you should keep the cursor on the newly-typed character; if the same digit is pushed again, you should change the newly-typed character. If another digit is typed, make the selected digit 'permanent' and show the cursor on the character for the new key. If no key is pushed for a second or so, advance the cursor to the next position. If enter is pushed when the cursor is on a newly-typed digit, just advance the cursor.

GCC is right, this is not standard-compliant C++ code (seeing as even a for loop variable "i" is not redeclared sometimes). PS

When deciding whether to use the -fglasgow-exts flag in Haskell, consider both portability and readability. While some extensions like MultiParamTypeClasses, FlexibleContexts, and FlexibleInstances have no significant impact on readability, others like ParallelListComp, TypeFamilies, and FunctionalDependencies may make code harder to understand for those unfamiliar with them. It's recommended to avoid using these extensions unless they provide a significant benefit.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
So in addition to portability, you should consider readability too. Usage of uncommon extensions may make your code more difficult to read (for people who are unfamiliar with the extensions). In this case, I would recommend to try to avoid these extensions unless they bring a benefit. Haskell 2010 is due to be released in late 2009. The set of changes to be incorporated will be announced at the Haskell Symposium, September 3 2009.

The @ symbol in C# is used to avoid processing escape sequences in strings, making it easier to write fully qualified file names and other paths.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can safely avoid anything that creates confusion. The only place i use @ is with strings. From MSDN:
The advantage of @-quoting is that escape sequences are not processed, which makes it easy to write, for example, a fully qualified file name:
<code>@"c:\Docs\Source\a.txt"  // rather than "c:\\Docs\\Source\\a.txt"</code>

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

To improve the speed of a custom form shape loading, you can store the region on disk and read it from a file instead of recalculating it every time. This can be achieved by serializing the GraphicsPath object, storing it in a file, and then deserializing it when the form loads.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The region object can't be directly serialized as it isn't marked with Serializable. However, you can easily serialize it anyways The method shown below will probably be enough for you and shows the idea but it would make more sense in production code to save <code>region.dat</code> as a resource and compile it with your application.

From speed tests that have been done, using SQL Adapters (ADO.Net) is the fastest way to get your information. However, considering you're on .Net, I'd recommend using LINQ if possible - it's much much cleaner and quicker to work with. That being said, unless your queries are massive, what you're using should be extremely fast.

Oracle will treat an inline view as a table, allowing predicate pushing and potentially using indexes, as shown in the explain plan. This can be achieved by creating tables, indexes, and gathering statistics, and the query will be optimized correctly in most cases.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Oracle will effectively treat this inline view as a table. It can use predicate pushing to apply a filter on the inline view to the base tables, and potentially use an index. This type of query structure is called an inline view. Ideally, an inline view would work exactly like a pre-built table with the same data. But in general you are definitely on the right path - build a large query by assembling small inline views, and assume that Oracle will optimize it correctly.

These three f() functions are difference but it is legal to declare same virtual function in two class because f() in A is overridden in F() in B. It function call depends on the class object. so as according to above code , you do not have permission to create an instance of class A and B. hence every time the function define inside class C will be called.

The issue is with iOS7 compatibility on iPad, where the viewport width returns 768 instead of 320 in compatibility mode.

Ground truth:
When opening a UTF-8 file with the <code>codecs</code> module, as you did, the contents of the file are automatically decoded into Unicode strings, so you must not try to decode them again. The same is true when writing the file; if you write it using the <code>codecs</code> module, the Unicode string you're passing will automatically be encoded to whatever encoding you specified. If the application doesn't recognize the UTF-8 file, it might help saving it with a BOM (Byte Order Mark) (which is generally discouraged, but if the application can't recognize a UTF-8 file otherwise, it's worth a try):

To review a SQL script in MySQL Workbench, use the built-in option to preview the script before sending it to the server, and consider adding the DELIMITER command to separate individual SQL commands, although this is not necessary in the object editors.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
1) MySQL Workbench offers the option to review the generated SQL script before it is sent to the server. The <code>DELIMITER</code> command is usually necessary to switch the current delimiter that ends a single statement (which is by default a semicolon) to something else because the stored procedure code itself needs the semicolon to separate individual commands. However the sp code must be sent as a whole to the server. A few more details: the <code>DELIMITER</code> keywword is a client keyword only, that means the server doesn't know it and doesn't need it. It's an invention for clients to properly separate sql commands before sending them to the server (you cannot send a list of commands to a server, only individual statements). This might disappear in future version but for now just ignore it.

Autocomplete algorithms are typically implemented using three strategies: Trees, Pattern Partitioning, and Filtering. Trees offer fast searches at the expense of memory storage, while Pattern Partitioning uses hashing for pattern occurrences. Filtering involves finding potential matches and then applying a sequential algorithm.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Autocomplete is usually implemented using one of the following: one can execute very fast searches at the expense of memory storage. The tree traversal can be adapted for approximate matching. By partitioning the text into tokens (ngrams) one can execute searches for pattern occurrences using a simple hashing scheme. Find a set of potential matches and then apply a sequential algorithm to check each candidate.

It seems like the provided answer is not related to the question. The question asks about the economical approach for getting a date in string format, but the answer mentions a library (JodaTime) and its speed comparison with SimpleDateFormat, which is not directly related to the question.

However, if I had to create a summary for the answer, it would be:

The JodaTime library is 5 times faster than SimpleDateFormat for date formatting.

But to provide a summary for the original question, I would say:

The economical approach for getting a date in string format is not specified, but using a calendar object through a date instance might be considered.

Ground truth:
If you need improved speed maybe in synchronization or database handling, the best way is to use JodaTime Library, it is 5 times faster than SimpleDateFormat.

The issue with a "param is missing or the value is empty: exercise" error in Rails was caused by a POST request to the workout_exercise_path due to a method parameter in the link_to helper. The solution involved removing the method parameter, correcting the form_for object, and adjusting the route for listing exercises on the workout_exercises_path.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I had a chat with Liz and it appears that the problem was from the <code>show_workout</code> route, where the <code>method: :index</code> was added as an argument to the link_to, which resulted in a POST(instead of a GET) request to the workout_exercise_path. The router directed this to the create action, which was resulted in the aforementioned error. Resolving this required removing the method: :index. The fix was to change this to workout_exercise_path(@workout, exercise)

To avoid generating any response for a specific URL in Flask, you can use the `@app.errorhandler()` decorator to catch 404 and 500 errors and log them instead of returning a response. 

This can be done by defining static methods `error404` and `error500` that handle the logging of these errors, and then decorating them with `@app.errorhandler(404)` and `@app.errorhandler(500)`.

The implementation is neither a Factory nor a Service Locator. It doesn't create new instances, and it returns objects implementing a single common interface, not distinct services.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This implementation is not the Factory because it doesn't create new instances. It isn't Service Locator either, because it is not locating services - now this requires a few words of explanation. Bottom line, negative consequences appear when a class doesn't declare its dependencies explicitly. Your class depends on SomeInterface and then asks for the resolver object which also knows of SomeInterface. I don't see negative consequences there.

Two approaches to ensure fixtures are loaded before classes in Rails tests: 

1. Detecting the fixtures loaded event and forcing the class reload, but this is problematic due to the absence of a fixtures loaded event and issues with cache_classes.
2. Wrapping the test runner in a task that loads fixtures first.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With the goal to make sure fixtures are loaded before classes there is a couple of directions to explore. One is to detect when fixtures finish loading and force reload the <code>Thing</code> class for it to generate proper scopes. Another, more promising approach is described in this answer and consists in putting the test runner task in a wrapper which ensures fixtures are loaded first.

To establish a 1:0..1 relationship between the same models in Entity Framework (EF) code-first, use the following configuration:

- In the model, define a one-to-many relationship on one end and a one-to-one relationship on the other end.
- Use `ICollection<T>` for the many side and a non-nullable foreign key for the one side.
- Configure the relationships in the `OnModelCreating` method using `HasMany` and `HasForeignKey`.

Alternatively, if the special resource can be special for many modules, change the model to use a one-to-many relationship on the resource side, with a collection of modules. Configure this relationship using `HasMany` and `HasForeignKey`.

The error "No such file or directory" occurred when running gunicorn due to a discrepancy between the build and run environments. The solution was to run gunicorn using the Python interpreter explicitly, i.e., `python3 env/bin/gunicorn`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
For future readers, I had this issue when trying to launch a Django server using gunicorn. I was using AWS CodeBuild to build the virtual environment and run tests and using CodeDeploy to put the built artifacts onto the production server and launch the new version (all environments were Ubuntu 20.04). To be more specific, all of the files in <code>env/bin</code> had the shebang <code>#!/codebuild/output/src715682316/src/env/bin/python</code>, so of course running <code>env/bin/gunicorn</code> on the production server would fail. I was able to fix this problem by starting gunicorn using <code>python3 env/bin/gunicorn</code> instead of <code>env/bin/gunicorn</code>.

Attempting to build a second sub-sub site where some components can be used is going to be a maintenance nightmare. An alternative would be to create a second top level module that pulling in only the components you need but again this is a lot of ectra work on your end and your users would need to download additional files.

To give some margin between buttons, use the Bootstrap grid system and CSS to override the default layout. Apply the `margin` property to the buttons, for example, using the following CSS: `.box { border: 10px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 10px; } #ButtonsWithMoreMargin .btn { margin: 10px 5px; }`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You are apparently using Bootstrap so after removing all your CSS and just using basic bootstrap markup, buttons are evenly spaced. But Buttons are inline elements, if they are not being laid out correctly it's due to your combination of html/css overriding default behaviors. Also, keep in mind that the bootstrap <code>xs</code> grid classes (  <code>col-xs-*</code> ) keeps things horizontal at all times regardless of media size.

you will need to make
sure you have Perl installed and will need to explicitly invoke it via
Perl. The way the script is set up it will work automatically under Unix
because <strong>Unix has the ability to run scripts directly</strong> by identifying the
correct script processor from the first line of the script. Of course
you still need Perl installed, but that is taken for granted in most
Unix installations.

The issue was a false expectation on the part of the user, who thought the provided ZeroMQ example code was a self-contained service/client code. However, it was actually a server-only app with a REP socket that waits for a client to send a request through a REQ socket. The user's confusion was caused by the lack of explicit confirmation in the code and a compiler deprecation warning. The issue was resolved when the user hooked up a client app to the server, which made the code work as expected.

Ground truth:
About the hanging that I saw in my <strong>UPDATED</strong> question, I finally figured out what's going on. It's a false expectation on my part. So the "hang" that I was seeing is completely normal! As soon as I hook up a client app to it, things start rolling instantly. So to be fair the lack of visual cue and the compiler deprecation warning caused me to question the sample code as a new user, but the story that the code tells is valid. But all of a sudden all @user3666197 says in his answer starts to make sense.

In Convolutional Neural Networks, "Activations" refer to the output features detected by each layer, with earlier layers detecting simpler features like edges and later layers detecting more complex features like faces or objects. "Activation Gradients" are the gradients obtained during back-propagation in fully connected layers, which show gray or black values. "Weights" are the parameters learned by each layer to detect features, and "Weight Gradients" are the gradients of these weights, which are used to update the weights during training.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<strong>Confusion point 1</strong>
For Convolutional Layers, every layer has a duty to detect features. Imagine that you want to detect a human face, first layer will detect edges, maybe next layer will detect your noses and so on. <strong>Confusion point 2</strong>
If you look through fully connnected layers, I think they probably showing up the gradients they obtained during back-propagation. <strong>Confusion point 3</strong>

There are two problems in the code. 

1. The `indexOf` method is used in the `filterGender` function, which can be replaced by directly comparing the gender.

To fix this, a new variable `this.list` is defined in the constructor, and the upcoming list is assigned to this variable in the `getList` function. The `filterGender` and `filterAge` functions are then updated to use `this.list` instead of `this.state.list`.

<strong>Problem 1:</strong> use of <code>indexOf</code> in <strong>filterGender</strong> function
<strong>Solution 1:</strong> directly compare the gender instead of <code>indexOf</code> You are filtering records from the <code>this.state.list</code> variable and then update it in same <code>state</code> variable. Define variable in <code>constructor</code> Hope this will work for you!

Filtering a list in React can be done using the `Array.filter()` method for gender and `Array.sort()` with a comparator function for age. 

For gender filtering, replace the `indexOf` method with `Array.filter()` and check for equality using `user.gender.toLowerCase() === gender`. 

For age sorting, use `Array.sort()` and compare dates using `new Date(b.dob) - new Date(a.dob)`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Full working demo with corrected code in same environment <strong>Gender</strong>

<strong>Issue</strong> - <code>indexOf</code> function use does't achieves anything. <strong>Resolution</strong> -: 
Using simple <code>Array.filter</code> with gender equality. <strong>Age</strong>

<strong>Issue</strong> - Filtering won't be helpful to sort data. <strong>Resolution</strong> -: 
Using <code>Array.sort</code> and adding a comparator function.

To achieve fast Python decompression, consider the following approach:

1. Use a compression library like gzip or lzma.
2. Store the compressed data directly in a Python module as literal bytes.
3. Load the decompressed data into a numpy array directly.

This method is particularly effective for low-entropy data and can result in significant performance improvements, with lzma being even faster than gzip.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
use gzip (or other) for compression directly store the compressed data in a python module as literal bytes With your "alaska" data this approach gives the following performance on my machine Note that the compilation of the module is reasonably fast (e.g. the lzma version compiles on my machine in just 0.1 seconds)

To compare user input strings case-insensitively, convert the input to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When comparing case-insensitive strings, it is common practice to compare all with lower case. In fact, in your program, there is no point of comparing the input with <code>London</code> (with capital "l"), that's why you should compare with <code>london</code> instead. This is better so you can keep the user's input as is, maybe you'll use it in another way later.

Generated abstractive summary:
To structure a large Rails app, consider splitting it into multiple applications, each handling specific subdomains, and use plugins like SubdomainFu to facilitate communication between them.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I see the kind of problem you are facing is, trying to build an application which will have various sub domains, so account_manager a plugin can solve your problem. also if your application is large enough to maintain than splitting them in two or three would be good idea, with restfull resources you can make your applications talk to each other and so. I think you can split the application in three to four different applications where set of clusters will handle each applications request, so the speed will be good. also you can bundle similar kind of functionality in one app to make sure maintaining them is easy.

The VS2010 Express debugger traps Ctrl+C in a Console app, which can be overridden by setting the console mode to ignore Ctrl+C.

Ground truth:
CTRL-C is wired directly to the console window itself for the 'break' operation. It aborts the ping. However, you can still tell the console directly to ignore CTRL-C and treat it as straight input yourself with SetConsoleMode. Just put the call with your chosen mode options at the beginning of your program and you should be good to go! Hope this helps!

To avoid messy PHP-page and HTML-form submits, create a hidden field in each form to describe its action, then use a switch statement in PHP to include the corresponding processing file based on the submitted action.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One way of managing where your code is, is for each of your forms to have a hidden field describing what the form does. Then you can check what form was submitted back and include another php file to deal with it. This way you ought to be able to separate your code from each other. Either way, it's a lot easier to maintain code this way. There are many patterns of organising code and this is just one of them.

To align text in Illustrator CS5, you can either set the text adjustment to "justify (all characters)" or use one of two alternative methods: adjust the tracking in the character panel or split the text field into individual characters and distribute them equally using the align panel.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When you create a text field, you can set its adjustment to "justify (all characters)" (you have to expand the paragraph panel for that, it's the most right adjustment). Then the text you enter is automatically distributed. Otherwise, you can also emulate that behaviour in one of these two ways: You can either change the distance between the character manually by increasing the tracking in the character panel (I don't know its correct english name); it's the control with the "A V" and the arrow below. Or you can split the text field into one for each character and distribute that equally using the align panel.

To get started in modern game programming and application programming, use resources such as NeHe tutorials for OpenGL, DirectX tutorial, XNA for C#, and GameDev.net for community support.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With C/C++ I'd say the NeHe tutorials are a great place to get started (OpenGL) and DirectXtutorial.com for DirectX. If you are leaning towards the C# category, XNA is the way to go. A great site to help you further on the subject is GameDev. There are tons of aspiring developers just like yourself and a lot of people willing to help you in just about any aspect of game programming, good luck!

To summarize the answer to the MySQL select records that sums question, here is a concise summary:

The original solution attempts to directly query the database to find records that sum to a target value, but this approach has limitations. A more effective approach is to retrieve all records and calculate the sum programmatically in the application. Alternatively, if the goal is to track inventory, a simpler query can be used to retrieve all products in the order they were received, and then process the records to achieve the desired result.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This type of solution will only work if your expecting that you only need two rows ever to equal your target sum. Since this is most likely not the case, your best bet is probably to try and get all of the rows and do this programaticly on the returned data. Based on the updated information from this request, I have an alternate answer.

The data in Excel is likely stored as text with leading zeros, and OleDb is treating it as a string.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I bet the data is stored in the Excel spreadsheet as text; because it wouldn't natively have leading zeroes (although the cells could be formatted to show them.) I expect OleDb is asking Excel what datatype, and Excel thinks they are strings. If ihis is the case (or even if it's not, but you want unformatted data), one way off the top of my head would be to copy the worksheet to another worksheet and transform the Excel column with the Val(address) function, and reformat it without leading zeroes; then read from that.

To clarify the $data findAll query in CakePHP, the association between tables is key. If table2.sub_id is a foreign key linking to table1, CakePHP's HABTM or belongsTo relationships can automatically fetch associated records from table2. However, model associations are affected by the Model->recursive property.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Supernovah -
Please clarify one thing for me: you write that you want to only have values put into $data when table1.id is found in table2.sub_id. I think Beau is right -- if you have the models correctly linked, using a HABTM or belongsTo, etc., variable, the findAll should automatically pull the associated records from table2. If you have changed the value of the recursive property in your code, it would alter how deep the model relations are allowed to go on a given query.

Are your first 10 rows pure numeric data? Then the driver is making a judgment call that the whole column is numeric. I would try:
1) drop the IMEX - experiment without it
2) Try adding a single quote as the first character to all the data in that column. This should force the driver to see the column as text.

To summarize the answer: The question is unclear, but the database should be structured with columns for price, in stock status, and date sold to accurately track sales.

Ground truth:
From what I interpret, here's the structure of your database: Which sorta confuses me, since each value in the database has no price attribute. Personally, I think your idea to find out price sold is flawed. It would make more sense to add a few more fields to your database: In changing your database, you can easily keep track of when a product arrives, the date sold, its price, maybe quantity (I can't tell if its an actual field or not).

Unless you abstract out the setters, you will need an event notification mechanism, such as PropertyChangeSupport. You can use Glazed Lists' ObservableElementList to handle association synchronization from the list end, and property change monitoring for the other direction. However, this requires a special list implementation in the B class.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism. If your objects are JavaBeans, then you are looking at using PropertyChangeSupport and firing property change events. If you do that (or have some other mechanism for detecting changes), then Glazed Lists provides an ObservableElementList that could easily be used to handle the association synchronization from the list end (i.e. adding A to List&lt; A&gt; automatically calls a.setB(b)). I realize that this isn't a generic solution, but it seems like it would be an easy foundation for one. We use both techniques in concert with each other in almost all of our applications, but have never tried to go quite as abstract as what you are asking about. With the above in place, it would be possible to have a number of pre-defined Connectors and Synchronizers that meet different binding criteria.

The original question asked for a generic Java framework to manage bidirectional associations and inverse updates, but the solution involved using an AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) approach with the Gemini package, which was found on CNET with available source code and dependencies.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I was looking for a replacement for gemini, so for a way to handle this in an unobtrusive manner, without polluting the code with endless checks and special List implementations. This calls of course for an AOP based approach, as suggested by Kevin. Since now all sources are available bugs can be fixed.

The issue with Eclipse's WTP translation output may be caused by missing includes or XML namespaces, or it may be a known issue in Eclipse 3.3 that has not been tested in 3.4.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I've seen the eclipse JSP editor get really confused over almost nothing. You said the problem goes away if you remove the  tag. I know that Eclipse 3.3 sometimes had some issues with JSP files where opening them, and forcing a save would clear the file of error messages (I haven't tried 3.4 yet). Maybe that's what's happening to you.

To restrict which tabs are selectable in a UITabBarController, set a delegate and implement the `tabBarController:shouldSelectViewController:` and `tabBarController:didSelectViewController:` methods to return valid values based on the login status.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Restricting which tabs are selectable, is achieved by setting a delegate of the UITabBarController (i.e. one that conforms to UITabBarControllerDelegate). In the delegate, you should implement these two methods:
– tabBarController:shouldSelectViewController:
– tabBarController:didSelectViewController:

In a batch file, use the `IF` command without the `THEN` word and enclose multiple commands in parentheses. Use `NOT` before the condition but not `AND` or `OR`. To combine conditions, nest `IF` commands or use a trick with the `SET` command to define `AND` as `IF`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You have several small errors in your code. This is an example of a valid IF: In an <code>IF</code> command you may only use NOT before the condition, but there is no way to combine <em>two conditions</em> with AND, OR, etc. However, you may nest another <code>IF</code> command into the first one: However, you <em>may</em> write previous code in a slightly clearer way with the aid of a small trick:

To compare and merge two CSV files using Perl, use the following commands:

- Remove headers and spaces, sort, and save each file as 'a' and 'b'.
- Use the 'join' command to match fields and print matching rows to a new file 'newfile.csv'.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You could try something along these lines: The "sed" command removes the header line (line 1), and all spaces from alexa_products.csv. Then the remainder of the file is sorted using "sort" and saved as file "a". Likewise, file "data_products" has its header and spaces removed, gets sorted and stored in file "b". Then "join" uses field 1 of file "a" and matches it with field "2" in file b and prints where they match.

Ground truth:
If you are at least there, there's an obvious second problem:
The <code>DataGridTextColumn</code>s are bound to collections. DataGrid</code> needs to be bound to the collection in question (your dictionary pairs), while the columns get bound <em>relative to each item in that collection</em>. One more thing to mention is that any changes to the dictionary after the UI initialized will not be reflected, because <code>Dictionary&lt;K, V&gt;</code>s are not observable.

- For multiple checkboxes with the same class: `$(".className").prop("checked")` returns `true` or `false`.
- For an input box with the same class: `!$(".className").val()` returns `true` if the box is empty, otherwise `false`.

Extractive summary:
For multiple checkboxes, if they all have same class, then just use,

Ground truth:
<code>$("checkbox").prop("checked")</code> should return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> based on the state of the element. The above statement should return true or false. Make manipulations based on this.

To fix a DataTemplate in Silverlight 5 to show list data, remove unnecessary StackPanels and ItemsControl, and use the DataGrid directly. Additionally, use the DataTemplate as the ItemTemplate of a control that can display multiple items, such as a ListBox.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In most case when your <code>StackPanel</code> or any other container control contains only single control, that means you don't need the container. You need to choose either to use <code>ItemsControl</code> or <code>DataGrid</code> in this part. But as you said in comment, you didn't see a <em>repetitive structure</em> when trying to debug, then the problem possibly resides in the place where you use the <code>DataTemplate</code>. You should use <code>DataTemplate</code> as Item Template of a control that can show multiple items such as <code>ListBox</code> or the same to be able to see that <em>repetitive structure</em>.

To change the foreground color of an image in a view, consider using image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.NET to edit the image directly, or overlay the new image over the original and adjust visibility as needed.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It might be simpler to create a copy of the image and edit it in Photoshop, GIMP or Paint. These apps have tools for swapping pixel colors. Or you can overlay the foreground color image overtop of the main image, setting its Visibility=Collapsed. If you are using the standard black/white app icons, they have versions that are white-on-black and black-on-white.

To open a new window in JavaScript, use the `window.open()` method, specifying the URL to open (either full or relative) and window dimensions. However, be cautious with relative URLs, as they may redirect to the same page, and JavaScript cannot copy content between windows.

Extractive summary:
<code>var printWindow = window.open('', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> would open a blank url
<code>var printWindow = window.open('print.aspx', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> opens page <em>print.aspx</em> relative to current url.

Ground truth:
You should provide the full url when possible, else it tries to use the relative url. <code>var printWindow = window.open('', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> would open a blank url
<code>var printWindow = window.open('print.aspx', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> opens page <em>print.aspx</em> relative to current url. So if current url is <em>www.google.com</em>, it opens <em>www.google.com/print.aspx</em>, which would be 404 page not found. For example if you run this on current stackoverflow page it would open this page itself because <em><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18633800/xxxxxx/print.aspx</code></em> would redirect to <em><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18633800/xxxxxx</code></em>
Also the jquery wont work because you cannot copy content from one window to another through javascript.

Null pointer exception occurs when code refers to a resource (src folder) not present outside of an IDE. To resolve, use a relative path or package the resource with the application, or consider using the Preferences API for persistent storage.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your code refers to a src folder which ought to be not present anymore, if your code is deployed. But if you deploy your application you have to care that the file is packaged with it. Note that the NullPointerException comes naturally as you are catching the IOException and then proceeding as nothing has happened with an uninitialized Reader. You should rather ensure the code dealing with the resource is not executed when the allocation fails. But for things like highscores you should consider the Preferences API instead which gives you a persistent storage independent from your application’s location.

To add additional parameters to a Codeigniter Form Helper "select" control, you can store the filepath as values and access it using the selected option value.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>$dropdown['filepath']</code> would use the option value as keys and store the filepath as the value. Then you can simply access <code>filepath[$(this).val()]</code> upon <code>change</code> event. As much as I love using <code>data-</code> attributes, one must not forget other ways to achieve their goals.
