Generated abstractive summary:
Both MVP and MVC frameworks separate concerns into three components: data source (model), application logic (controller/presenter), and display code (view). The main difference lies in how the controller and view interact: in MVC, the view and controller interact with the model but not each other, whereas in MVP, the presenter interacts with the model and view.

Extractive summary:
Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View). There is a discussion here regarding the differences between MVC vs MVP. The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view.

Here's a summary of the answer:

MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are two architectural patterns. The key differences are: 

- In MVP, the view is loosely coupled to the model and the presenter binds the model to the view.
- In MVC, the controller determines which view to display and can be shared across views.
- MVP is easier to unit test due to its interface-based interaction, while MVC has a more complex view-controller relationship.

Extractive summary:
Here are the key differences between   the patterns: MVP Pattern   View is more loosely coupled to the model.   responsible for binding the model to   Easier to unit test because interaction with the view is through   Can be responsible for determining which view to display

Question: What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?
Answer: MVP and MVC are presentation patterns that separate dependencies between a Model, View, and Controller/Presenter. The main difference is how the Model updates the View, with MVC allowing the Model to update the View directly.

Extractive summary:
Both presentation patterns. Most notable is that MVC pattern has the Model updating the View.

Generated abstractive summary:
Inversion of Control is a programming technique that involves delegating control of a program to external libraries or components, reducing code duplication by setting up a structure that triggers specific functions when certain events occur.

Extractive summary:
Instead of your program explicitly controlling everything, your program sets up a class or library with certain functions to be called when certain things happen. It solves code duplication.

Ground truth:
To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. It solves code duplication. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control.

MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are architectural patterns. 

- In MVP, the **view** is in charge and delegates to a **presenter**, which interacts with the **model**.
- In MVC, the **controller** is in charge and creates and manages the **view**, with the **view** being a slave to the controller.

Generated abstractive summary:
MVP and MVC are software design patterns used for user interface architecture. The main difference between them lies in how they handle the interaction between the view and the presenter/model. There are three types of MVP patterns: Passive View, Supervising Controller, and Presentation Model (also known as Model-View-ViewModel), each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

Extractive summary:
The third "flavor" of MVP (or someone would perhaps call it a separate pattern) is the Presentation Model (or sometimes referred to Model-View-ViewModel).

To determine whether to throw an IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter, follow the design of JDK libraries and throw a NullPointerException, including the parameter name in the exception message, and always follow the "fail-fast" principle by not allowing bad values to be set and throwing an exception immediately.

Extractive summary:
The convention is to include the parameter name which was null in the message of the exception. You should always the follow the "fail-fast" principle.

### Example
Question: C# loop - break vs. continue
Answer: A really easy way to understand this is to place the word "loop" after each of the keywords. The terms now make sense if they are just read like everyday phrases. <strong><code>break</code></strong> loop - looping is broken and stops. <strong><code>continue</code></strong> loop - loop continues to execute with the next iteration.
Summary: The keywords "break" and "continue" in a C# loop can be understood by adding "loop" to the end of each: "break loop" means the loop stops, and "continue loop" means the loop continues to the next iteration.

Extractive summary:
A really easy way to understand this is to place the word "loop" after each of the keywords.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
### Example
Question: C# loop - break vs. continue
Answer: 

The difference between `break` and `continue` in C# loops is their use case. `break` is used when there's no need to continue the loop after finding what you're looking for, whereas `continue` is used when you want to skip over certain elements in the loop.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I tend to use <code>break</code> in loops that are searching a list for something. Once found, there's no point in continuing, so you might as well quit. I use <code>continue</code> when doing something with most elements of a list, but still want to skip over a few. The <code>break</code> statement also comes in handy when polling for a valid response from somebody or something.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
In Ruby, loops are expressions that return the last result, and can be used with blocks. The break and next keywords behave differently in blocks: break jumps out of the calling code, while next skips the rest of the block and returns a value.

Extractive summary:
break will jump out of the code that called the block

Ground truth:
Ruby unfortunately is a bit different. break will jump out of the code that called the block next will skip the rest of the code in the block, and 'return' what you specify to the caller of the block.

Question: IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?
Answer: The author prefers using IllegalArgumentException over NullPointerException when a null parameter is passed, as it provides a more specific indication of the problem.

Let me know if you would like me to create a summary for another question.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In my mind IllegalArgumentException seems more specific than using a NPE since it's telling me that the problem was with an argument I passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method.

Generated abstractive summary:
When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the following: 

- Ensure equals() is an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and consistent).
- hashCode() must be consistent if the object's equals() value does not change.
- When overriding one, override the other, using the same fields to compute both.
- Use helper classes like EqualsBuilder and HashCodeBuilder from Apache Commons Lang library.
- For hash-based collections, ensure the hashCode() of keys does not change while the object is in the collection.

Extractive summary:
If you override one, then you should override the other.

Ground truth:
The theory (for the language lawyers and the mathematically inclined): <code>equals()</code> (javadoc) must define an equivalence relation (it must be <em>reflexive</em>, <em>symmetric</em>, and <em>transitive</em>). In addition, it must be <em>consistent</em> (if the objects are not modified, then it must keep returning the same value). Furthermore, <code>o.equals(null)</code> must always return false.

Question: What issues should be considered when overriding equals and hashCode in Java?
Answer: When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider using instanceof for final equals implementations or when implementing interfaces, but not when equals can be overridden to maintain symmetry property. Also, ensure that equals and compareTo methods are consistent if the class is Comparable.

Extractive summary:
If your class is also <code>Comparable</code>, the <code>equals</code> and <code>compareTo</code> methods should be consistent too.

Ground truth:
There are a couple of ways to do your check for class equality before checking member equality, and I think both are useful in the right circumstances. <li>Use the <code>instanceof</code> operator. <li>Use <code>this.getClass().equals(that.getClass())</code>.

A race condition is an issue in multi-threaded applications where the order of events is assumed without proper synchronization, often occurring when multiple threads access shared resources or rely on a specific order of events.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems. A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do. This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access. Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals. Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs.

The root cause of a NoSuchMethodError is likely due to a mismatch between the class version used during compilation and execution.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Without any more information it is difficult to pinpoint the problem, but the root cause is that you most likely have compiled a class against a different version of the class that is missing a method, than the one you are using when running it. If the exception appears when calling a method on an object in a library, you are most likely using separate versions of the library when compiling and running. Make sure you have the right version both places. If the exception appears when calling a method on objects instantiated by classes <em>you</em> made, then your build process seems to be faulty. Make sure the class files that you are actually running are updated when you compile.

A NoSuchMethodError can be caused by using reflection to extract a method that has changed during a refactor, requiring the reflection parameters to be updated to match the new method signature.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If you have code that reflects on a class and extracts a method by name (eg: with <code>Class.getDeclaredMethod("someMethodName", .....)</code>) then any time that method name changes, such as during a refactor, you will need to remember to update the parameters to the reflection method to match the new method signature, or the <code>getDeclaredMethod</code> call will throw a <code>NoSuchMethodException</code>. If this is the reason, then the stack trace should show the point that the reflection method is invoked, and you'll just need to update the parameters to match the actual method signature.

### Summary
The yield keyword in C# is used to implement the IEnumerable interface, allowing a function to return an object that can be iterated over, and the function is called repeatedly until it "yields" the next value.

Extractive summary:
The function returns an object that implements the IEnumerable interface. If a calling function starts foreach-ing over this object the function is called again until it "yields".

Ground truth:
If a calling function starts foreach-ing over this object the function is called again until it "yields". The easiest way understand code like this is to type in an example, set some breakpoints and see what happens. Try stepping through this for example: BIGBLOCK Here is a real-life example BIGBLOCK

Question: What is the yield keyword used for in C#?
Answer: The yield keyword in C# is used to implement the IEnumerable interface, forcing the caller to use a foreach loop to iterate over the yielded elements.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The Array's each method implementation <strong>yields</strong> control over to the caller (the 'puts x') with <strong>each</strong> element of the array neatly presented as x. However <strong>.Net</strong> doesn't go all the way here.. C# seems to have coupled yield with IEnumerable, in a way forcing you to write a foreach loop in the caller as seen in Mendelt's response.

Summary: The index of the current iteration of a foreach loop can be obtained using a counter, but a for loop is generally the more reasonable approach.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Unless your collection can return the index of the object via some method, the only way is to use a counter like in your example. Anything else introduces code complexity, not to mention time and space complexity.

Generated abstractive summary:
It's not possible to get the index of the current iteration of a foreach loop directly. Counting manually or using the collection's Count property is an alternative approach.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I don't believe there is a way to get the value of the current iteration of a foreach loop.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
The foreach loop in C# does not support indexing because it is designed to iterate over collections that implement IEnumerable, and the concept of an index is foreign to enumeration.

Extractive summary:
The <code>foreach</code> is for iterating over collections that implement <code>IEnumerable</code>. Obviously, the concept of an index is foreign to the concept of enumeration, and cannot be done.

Ground truth:
The <code>foreach</code> is for iterating over collections that implement <code>IEnumerable</code>. It does this by calling <code>GetEnumerator</code> on the collection, which will return an <code>Enumerator</code>. Because of that, most collections are able to be traversed using an indexer and the for loop construct.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
It's possible to get the index of the current iteration of a foreach loop in LINQ using a specific method, but it's not recommended due to potential performance issues.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It's only going to work for a List and not any IEnumerable, but in LINQ there's this: That said, List might keep an index of each object along with the count. It would be better to just keep a count of where you're up to in the foreach though, simpler, and more adaptable.

Question: How do you give a C# Auto-Property a default value?
Answer: When you inline an initial value for a variable it will be done implicitly in the constructor anyway. However, in C#6 and later, you can use a new syntax to give a C# Auto-Property a default value.

In C# 6 and above, you can give an auto-property a default value using the syntax, or assign it from the constructor. Alternatively, you can use the DefaultValueAttribute in .NET.

In C# 6 and above you can simply use the syntax:

Ground truth:
In C# 6 and above you can simply use the syntax: You can also assign <code>readonly</code> auto-properties from the constructor. I'd avoid adding a default to the constructor; leave that for dynamic assignments and avoid having two points at which the variable is assigned (i.e.

Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` instead of a `NullPointerException` when a method expects a non-null parameter.

Extractive summary:
Therefore, if your method wants to explicitly disallow null, as opposed to just happening to have a null value raise a NullPointerException, you should throw an IllegalArgumentException.

To position one image on top of another in HTML, use CSS width and height properties instead of HTML attributes, and include a content-type with the <style> tag.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The HTML <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes do not allow for units; you're likely thinking of the CSS <code>width:</code> and <code>height:</code> properties. You should also provide a content-type (<code>text/css</code>; see Espo's code) with the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag. Leaving <code>px;</code> in the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes might cause a rendering engine to balk.

The difference between #include <filename> and #include "filename" is that the first searches for a header in the include path, while the second searches for a file of the given name first, and if not found, behaves like the first form.

Extractive summary:
If the <code>#include "file"</code> form is used, the implementation first looks for a file of the given name, if supported.

Ground truth:
The sequence of characters between &lt; and > uniquely refer to a header, which isn't necessarily a file. If the <code>#include "file"</code> form is used, the implementation first looks for a file of the given name, if supported. If not (supported), or if the search fails, the implementation behaves as though the other (<code>#include &lt;file&gt;</code>) form was used.

The key differences between a binary semaphore and a mutex are: 

- A binary semaphore only allows a single get operation at a time, regardless of the thread context. 
- A mutex allows multiple sequential get operations from the same thread context, but requires an equal number of put operations before another thread can access it.

Extractive summary:
The multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex. This differs from binary semaphores, for which only a single get is allowed at a time, regardless of thread contexts.

In terms of direct values, an unsigned char provides a double range on the positive end compared to a regular char, guaranteeing a range of [0, 255] when CHAR_BIT is 8. It's used for examining the representation and bit patterns of POD objects, allowing direct conversion to an array of unsigned char.

Extractive summary:
This allows you to examine the representation and bit patterns of the object.

Ground truth:
In terms of direct values a regular char is used when the values are known to be between <code>CHAR_MIN</code> and <code>CHAR_MAX</code> while an unsigned char provides double the range on the positive end. For example, if <code>CHAR_BIT</code> is 8, the range of regular <code>char</code> is only guaranteed to be [0, 127] (because it can be signed or unsigned) while <code>unsigned char</code> will be [0, 255] and <code>signed char</code> will be [-127, 127].

It seems like you forgot to include the rest of the answer for the new example. Please provide the rest of the answer, and I'll create a concise summary for you. 

Assuming the rest of the answer is:

The reason for the <code>using</code> statement is to ensure that the object is disposed as soon as it goes out of scope, and it doesn't require explicit code to ensure that this happens. As in <em>Understanding the 'using' statement in C#</em>, the .NET CLR converts BIGBLOCK to BIGBLOCK. This is particularly useful for database connections, file handles, and other resources that should be released as soon as they are no longer needed.

Here is the summary:

The "using" statement in C# is used to ensure that objects are disposed of as soon as they go out of scope, without requiring explicit code, making it useful for resources like database connections and file handles.

Generated abstractive summary:
The "using" keyword in C# allows for the implementation of the IDisposable pattern, enabling explicit start and end of operations through a using syntax, which the compiler will automatically call Dispose on the used object.

Extractive summary:
Basically, you can take advantage of the fact that the compiler will <strong>always</strong> call .Dispose on the "used" object.

Ground truth:
Basically, you can take advantage of the fact that the compiler will <strong>always</strong> call .Dispose on the "used" object. If you have something that needs to happen after a certain operation ... something that has a definite start and end ... then you can simply make an IDisposable class that starts the operation in the constructor, and then finishes in the Dispose method. This is also how the System.Transactions stuff works.

Generated abstractive summary:
The difference between #include <filename> and #include "filename" is the order in which the preprocessor searches for the file. The angle bracket form (<filename>) searches predefined directories and -I directories first, while the quote form ("filename") searches the current file's directory first.

Extractive summary:
A preprocessing directive of the form A preprocessing directive of the form A preprocessing directive of the form

Ground truth:
The <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> include tells the preprocessor to search in <code>-I</code> directories and in predefined directories first, then in the .c file's directory. The <code>"file"</code> include tells the preprocessor to search the source file's directory first, and then revert to <code>-I</code> and predefined. All destinations are searched anyway, only the order of search is different. A preprocessing directive of the form searches a sequence of implementation-defined places for a header identified uniquely by the specified sequence between the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> delimiters, and causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the header. A preprocessing directive of the form causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified by the specified sequence between the <code>"</code> delimiters. If this search is not supported, or if the search fails, the directive is reprocessed as if it read with the identical contained sequence (including <code>&gt;</code> characters, if any) from the original   directive.

Unsigned char is a data type used in computer graphics, often representing a single byte (0-255) for each colour component, making it suitable for RGB or RGBA colours.

Extractive summary:
It is common to see an RGB (or RGBA) colour represented as 24 (or 32) bits, each an unsigned char.

Ground truth:
Since unsigned char values fall in the range [0,255], the values are typically interpreted as As explained already, a signed char's range is essentially shifted by -128.

To ignore files in Subversion, you can use one of three methods: 

1. The "global-ignores" option in the Runtime Configuration Area, which applies to all repositories on your computer.
2. The "svn:ignore" property, which is stored within the repository and applies to directories.
3. The "svn:global-ignores" property, which is similar to "svn:ignore" but uses SVN 1.8's inherited properties feature.

You can also list ignored files using the "svn status" command with the "--no-ignore" option.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Subversion, as of version 1.8 (June 2013) and later, supports 3 different ways of specifying file patterns. The command <code>svn status</code> will hide ignored files (that is, files that match an RGA <code>global-ignores</code> pattern, or match an immediate parent directory's <code>svn:ignore</code> pattern or match any ancesor directory's <code>svn:global-ignores</code> pattern.

Question: Why is using the JavaScript eval function a bad idea?
Answer: Unless you let eval() a dynamic content (through cgi or input), it is as safe and solid as all other JavaScript in your page.

Summary: Using the JavaScript eval function is safe if used with static content, but its security is compromised when evaluating dynamic content.

Extractive summary:
Unless you let eval() a dynamic content (through cgi or input), it is as safe and solid as all other JavaScript in your page.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

Using the JavaScript `eval` function is generally discouraged due to its potential for security issues and bugs, but it's not always evil. When using `eval`, always sanity-check the code to ensure a safer and cleaner alternative is not available.

Extractive summary:
eval isn't always evil. Any time you use eval you need to sanity-check what you're doing, because chances are you could be doing it a better, safer, cleaner way.

Ground truth:
So the more we can do to throw a question mark over eval, the better. To give an all-too-typical example, to set the colour of an element with an id stored in the variable 'potato': BIGBLOCK If the authors of the kind of code above had a clue about the basics of how JavaScript objects work, they'd have realised that square brackets can be used instead of literal dot-names, obviating the need for eval: BIGBLOCK ...which is much easier to read as well as less potentially buggy.

Question: Why is using the JavaScript eval function a bad idea?
Answer: Using eval() is generally not recommended for your own code due to security risks, but it can be a useful trick to bypass restrictions in restricted environments.

I removed unnecessary details and focused on the main points of the answer to create a concise summary.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One thing to keep in mind is that you can often use eval() to execute code in an otherwise restricted environment - social networking sites that block specific JavaScript functions can sometimes be fooled by breaking them up in an eval block - BIGBLOCK However, for all the reasons mentioned above, you shouldn't use it for your own code, where you have complete control - it's just not necessary, and better-off relegated to the 'tricky JavaScript hacks' shelf.

Generated abstractive summary:
Views evaluate data at query time and can perform poorly if the underlying select statement is complex. Materialized views store the query result in a table, which can improve performance by reducing the need to resolve joins at query time and enabling query rewriting. However, materialized view data is only as up-to-date as its last refresh, which can be manually, scheduled, or triggered by database changes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Views evaluate the data in the tables underlying the view definition at the time the view is queried. It is a logical view of your tables, with no data stored anywhere else. Materialized views are similar to regular views, in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement), however, the underlying query resultset has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view, you are querying a table, which may also be indexed. The downside though is that the data you get back from the materialized view is only as up to date as the last time the materialized view has been refreshed. Materialized views are most often used in data warehousing / business intelligence applications where querying large fact tables with thousands of millions of rows would result in query response times that resulted in an unusable application.

A metaclass is the class of a class, defining how a class behaves. It's an instance of a metaclass itself. The `type` class is Python's usual metaclass, and creating a custom metaclass involves subclassing `type`. Metaclasses are commonly used as class factories, allowing you to perform actions when creating a class, such as registering it or replacing it with another class.

Extractive summary:
A metaclass is the class of a class. A class is an instance of a metaclass. <code>type</code> is the usual metaclass in Python. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass <code>type</code>.

To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass <code>type</code>. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the <code>__metaclass__</code> attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the <code>__metaclass__</code> global variable.

### Summary
MVP (Model-View-Presenter) has three components: Model, View, and Presenter. The Presenter contains UI business logic for the View and is decoupled from the View. There are three variations of MVP: 

- **Passive View**: The View is dumb and contains almost zero logic, and the Presenter talks to the View and Model. It has maximum testability but requires more work for data binding.
- **Supervising Controller**: The Presenter handles user gestures, and the View binds to the Model directly. It reduces code but has less testable surface and less encapsulation in the View.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: The Controller determines which View to display in response to any action. The View is stateless and does not directly bind to the Model. It has a larger testable surface than Supervising Controller.
- **Presentation Model (or Model-View-ViewModel)**: The View binds directly to a Presentation Model, which is a Model crafted specifically for the View. This approach removes the need for code-behind and is suitable for WPF applications.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In MVP, the Presenter contains the UI business logic for the View. In the MVC, the Controller is responsible for determining which View to display in response to any action including when the application loads.

The question asks for a free text editor that can handle files larger than 4GB. The answer suggests that the editor "TheGun" can handle large files, but its memory limit is determined by available memory, and editing large files may require clever methods like storing local changes and applying them in chunks.

Extractive summary:
But then, if you need to edit the file, some clever method should be used, like storing in memory the local changes, and applying them chunk by chunk when saving.

Ground truth:
For example, TheGun, a very small text editor written in assembly language, claims to "<em>not have an effective file size limit and the maximum size that can be loaded into it is determined by available memory and loading speed of the file.

Generated abstractive summary:
A smart pointer is a type of pointer that automatically deletes the object it points to when it goes out of scope, similar to a regular pointer but with the added benefit of memory management. It's useful for managing objects with a lifetime tied to a specific scope or block, but should not be used when the pointer doesn't own the data or when the pointer will persist beyond its intended scope.

Extractive summary:
If the object is assigned to a smart pointer, then they will be deleted when the program exits that function/block. You may not want to use a smart pointer when: ... the pointer shouldn't actually own the data...

Ground truth:
A smart pointer is like a regular (typed) pointer, like "char*", except when the pointer itself goes out of scope then what it points to is deleted as well. You can use it like you would a regular pointer, by using "->", but not if you need an actual pointer to the data.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
A smart pointer is a class that manages the lifetime of an object being pointed to, abstracting a raw pointer and alleviating issues like memory leaks and forgetting to delete objects. It defines a policy for when the object is destroyed, allowing the programmer to focus on creating the object rather than worrying about its destruction. There are different types of smart pointers, including scoped pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`) and reference-counted pointers (e.g., `std::shared_ptr`), each with their own use cases and considerations.

Extractive summary:
A smart pointer by comparison defines a policy as to when the object is destroyed.

Ground truth:
A smart pointer is a class that wraps a 'raw' (or 'bare') C++ pointer, to manage the lifetime of the object being pointed to. If you feel you need to use pointers (first consider if you really do), you would normally want to use a smart pointer as this can alleviate many of the problems with raw pointers, mainly forgetting to delete the object and leaking memory.

The Hamming Weight, also known as 'popcount' or 'sideways addition', is a problem of counting the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Here is a concise summary of the answer:

To count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer, consider using built-in compiler functions or intrinsics, such as GCC's `popcnt` instruction or MSVC's intrinsic, which can provide efficient hardware-based counting. Alternatively, a byte-at-a-time table lookup can be used as a fallback for architectures without single-instruction popcount.

Extractive summary:
Also consider the built-in functions of your compilers. Also note that gcc's fallback for architectures without single-instruction popcount is a byte-at-a-time table lookup.

Set this environment variable before running git:

Ground truth:
It looks like you're using a mingw compile of Git on windows (or possibly another one I haven't heard about). There are ways to debug this: I believe all of the http proxy work for git is done by curl. Set this environment variable before running git:

A mutex allows serialization of access to a resource, while a binary semaphore is a counter that advertises availability of a resource and blocks tasks until signaled.

Extractive summary:
mutexes allow serialization of access to a given resource i.e. The semaphore advertises that a resource is available, and it provides the mechanism to wait until it is signaled as being available.

Ground truth:
As such one can see a mutex as a token passed from task to tasks and a semaphore as traffic red-light (it signals someone that it can proceed).

The NOT IN clause with NULL values evaluates to UNKNOWN, which is treated as FALSE.

Extractive summary:
NOT ( UNKNOWN ) yields UNKNOWN.

Ground truth:
In A, 3 is tested for equality against each member of the set, yielding (FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, UNKNOWN). In B, I think it is evaluating the condition as NOT (3 in (1,2,null)). NOT ( UNKNOWN ) yields UNKNOWN. So overall the truth of the condition is unknown, which at the end is essentially treated as FALSE.

Generated abstractive summary:
Query A returns results when <code>3 = 3</code> is true, while Query B returns results when <code>3 &lt;&gt; null</code> is true, depending on the <code>ansi_nulls</code> setting.

Extractive summary:
Since <code>3 = 3</code> is true, you get a result.

Ground truth:
When <code>ansi_nulls</code> is on, <code>3 &lt;&gt; null</code> is UNKNOWN, so the predicate evaluates to UNKNOWN, and you don't get any rows. When <code>ansi_nulls</code> is off, <code>3 &lt;&gt; null</code> is true, so the predicate evaluates to true, and you get a row.

Optimistic vs. pessimistic locking: Optimistic locking assumes nothing changes during read, while pessimistic locking assumes changes occur and locks data. Use optimistic for non-essential reads and pessimistic for exact data operations requiring accurate, unaltered data.

Extractive summary:
Optimistic assumes that nothing's going to change while you're reading it. Pessimistic assumes that something will and so locks it. If it's not essential that the data is perfectly read use optimistic.

Ground truth:
Optimistic assumes that nothing's going to change while you're reading it. Pessimistic assumes that something will and so locks it. Most web applications are fine with dirty reads - on the rare occasion the data doesn't exactly tally the next reload does. It's often worth setting your transactions to read-committed or no-lock to avoid deadlocks while reading.

Generated abstractive summary:
To create a concise summary of the given answer, I will extract the key information and rephrase it in a few sentences. 

Here's the summary:

Optimistic and pessimistic locking are two approaches to concurrency control. Optimistic locking is used when few collisions are expected, incurring a higher cost when a collision occurs. Pessimistic locking is used when collisions are anticipated, blocking transactions that violate synchronization, and is chosen based on the estimated read and write operations.

Extractive summary:
Optimistic locking is used when you don't expect many collisions. Pessimistic locking is used when a collision is anticipated. The transactions which would violate synchronization are simply blocked.

Ground truth:
Optimistic locking is used when you don't expect many collisions. Pessimistic locking is used when a collision is anticipated.

Generated abstractive summary:
Optimistic vs. Pessimistic locking: Two strategies for managing concurrent database updates, where Optimistic Locking checks for version changes before updating a record, while Pessimistic Locking locks a record exclusively until use is finished, with better integrity but risk of Deadlocks.

Extractive summary:
Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it.

Ground truth:
Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, take note of a version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or checksums/hashes) and check that the version hasn't changed before you write the record back. Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it.

Question: Optimistic vs. Pessimistic locking
Answer: Optimistic locking improves concurrency but reduces predictability, while pessimistic locking reduces concurrency but is more predictable.

Extractive summary:
Pessimistic locking tends to reduce concurrency, but is more predictable.

Ground truth:
In addition to what's been said already, it should be said that optimistic locking tends to improve concurrency at the expense of predictability. Pessimistic locking tends to reduce concurrency, but is more predictable.

std::exception is the base exception class in the C++ standard library, but it's recommended to avoid using std::string as an exception class due to potential re-throwing issues.

Extractive summary:
<code>std::exception</code> is the base exception class in the C++ standard library. You may want to avoid using strings as exception classes because they themselves can throw an exception during use.

Ground truth:
Yes. You may want to avoid using strings as exception classes because they themselves can throw an exception during use.

Generated abstractive summary:
A static method is a Python method that receives only the arguments passed, with no implicit reference to the class or instance. It's generally unnecessary in Python, as a regular module function can be used instead. A class method, however, receives the class it was called on as the first argument, making it useful for creating factory methods that can instantiate the correct class, even when subclasses are involved.

Extractive summary:
It just gets the arguments that were passed, no implicit first argument. It is basically useless in Python -- you can just use a module function instead of a staticmethod. This is useful when you want the method to be a factory for the class: since it gets the actual class it was called on as first argument, you can always instantiate the right class, even when subclasses are involved.

Ground truth:
A <strong>staticmethod</strong> is a method that knows nothing about the class or instance it was called on. A <strong>classmethod</strong>, on the other hand, is a method that gets passed the class it was called on, or the class of the instance it was called on, as first argument. This is useful when you want the method to be a factory for the class: since it gets the actual class it was called on as first argument, you can always instantiate the right class, even when subclasses are involved.

Question: What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?
Answer: 
@staticmethod just disables the default function as method descriptor, while @classmethod wraps the function in a container callable that passes a reference to the owning class as its first argument, with a runtime overhead but enabling access to the owning class.

Extractive summary:
<code>@staticmethod</code> just disables the default function as method descriptor. classmethod wraps your function in a container callable that passes a reference to the owning class as first argument: As a matter of fact, <code>classmethod</code> has a runtime overhead but makes it possible to access the owning class.

Ground truth:
<code>@staticmethod</code> just disables the default function as method descriptor. Alternatively I recommend using a metaclass and putting the class methods on that metaclass:

Singletons are considered bad design because they hide dependencies, violate the single responsibility principle, cause tight coupling, make testing difficult, and carry state throughout the application's lifetime.

Extractive summary:
They inherently cause code to be tightly coupled. They carry state around for the lifetime of the application.

Ground truth:
Because you hide the dependencies of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces. They violate the single responsibility principle: by virtue of the fact that they control their own creation and lifecycle. They inherently cause code to be tightly coupled. They carry state around for the lifetime of the application.

The Singleton pattern is often misunderstood as a way to implement global variables, but it is intended to ensure only one instance of a class exists during runtime, providing benefits when used correctly.

Extractive summary:
Singleton is not a pattern to wrap globals. Singleton pattern should only be used to guarantee that one and only one instance of a given class exists during run time.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Bitwise shift operators in C++ and C shift bits to the left or right, equivalent to multiplication and division by powers of 2, respectively. There are three types of shift operators: left shift (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>), logical right shift (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>), and arithmetic right shift (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>), which preserves the sign of negative numbers by padding with the most significant bit. Lost bits are not recoverable.

Extractive summary:
They shift bits. <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. Left shift (&lt;&lt;) So we see that shifting to the right is equivalent to division by powers of 2. We cannot get back our original value once we have lost bits. By padding with the most significant bit, the arithmetic right shift is sign-preserving.

Ground truth:
The bit shifting operators do exactly what their name implies. They shift bits. <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the left shift operator, and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts. All of these operators can be applied to integer values (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, possibly <code>short</code> and <code>byte</code> or <code>char</code>). In some languages, applying the shift operators to any datatype smaller than <code>int</code> automatically resizes the operand to be an <code>int</code>.

Accessing these bit-fields for reading/writing is the most common usage. <strong>Explanation</strong> In order to obtain the value of green ONLY, which starts at offset 5 and ends at 10 (i.e. 6-bits long), you need to use a (bit) mask, which when applied against the entire 16-bit pixel, will yield only the bits we are interested in. The appropriate mask is 0x7E0 which in binary is 0000011111100000 (which is 2016 in decimal). To apply a mask, you use the AND operator (&amp;).

### Summary
A POD (Plain Old Data) type in C++ is a type where the compiler guarantees no "magic" operations occur, such as constructors, destructors, or vtables. This includes built-in types, combinations of them, and certain classes and unions that only contain public, non-static, POD members with no user-defined constructors or destructors.

Extractive summary:
A POD is a type (including classes) where the C++ compiler guarantees that there will be no "magic" going on in the structure: for example hidden pointers to vtables, offsets that get applied to the address when it is cast to other types (at least if the target's POD too), constructors, or destructors. Roughly speaking, a type is a POD when the only things in it are built-in types and combinations of them.

Ground truth:
A POD is a type (including classes) where the C++ compiler guarantees that there will be no "magic" going on in the structure: for example hidden pointers to vtables, offsets that get applied to the address when it is cast to other types (at least if the target's POD too), constructors, or destructors. <li>Wikipedia is wrong to say that a POD cannot have members of type pointer-to-member. <strong>3.9(10):</strong> "Arithmetic types (3.9.1), enumeration types, pointer types, and pointer to member types (3.9.2) and cv-qualified versions of these types (3.9.3) are collectively caller scalar types. <strong>9(4):</strong> "A POD-struct is an aggregate class that has no non-static data members of type non-POD-struct, non-POD-union (or array of such types) or reference, and has no user-define copy operator and no user-defined destructor. <strong>8.5.1(1):</strong> "An aggregate is an array or class (clause 9) with no user-declared constructors (12.1), no private or protected non-static data members (clause 11), no base classes (clause 10) and no virtual functions (10.3)."

Generated abstractive summary:
The difference between a library and a framework is often context-dependent, but generally, a library is a collection of reusable code that can be linked against by an application, while a framework is a more comprehensive software system that provides a reusable design for a software project, often including libraries, support programs, and an API.

Extractive summary:
A software framework is a re-usable  design for a software system (or  subsystem). Various parts  of the framework may be exposed  through an API.. E.g.

Ground truth:
The difference between a bare library and the framework on Mac is that a framework can contain multiple different versions of the library. A software framework is a re-usable  design for a software system (or  subsystem). A software framework may  include support programs, code  libraries, a scripting language, or  other software to help develop and  glue together the different components  of a software project. So I'd say a library is just that, "a library". It is basically a file containing re-usable code that can usually be shared among multiple applications (you don't have to write the same code over and over again).

Question: When to use self over $this?
Answer: Use `self` for static member functions to access static variables, and `$this` for non-static member functions to reference the current class instance.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>self</code> (not $self) refers to the <em>type</em> of class, where as <code>$this</code> refers to the current <em>instance</em> of the class. <code>self</code> is for use in static member functions to allow you to access static member variables. <code>$this</code> is used in non-static member functions, and is a reference to the instance of the class on which the member function was called.

Here's a summary for the new example:

Polymorphism, overloading, and overriding are distinct concepts in programming. Overloading occurs when multiple functions with the same name take different parameters. Overriding happens when a child class replaces a parent's method with its own, but this alone does not constitute polymorphism. Polymorphism is achieved through late binding, where the actual method to be called is determined at runtime, allowing objects of a child class to be used where a base class is defined.

Extractive summary:

Generated abstractive summary:
Polymorphism refers to a language's ability to treat different objects uniformly using a single interface, related to overriding. It differs from overriding, where the interface (or base class) is polymorphic and the implementor (or derived class) overrides it. In languages like C++, polymorphism allows an object to behave differently depending on the interface used to access it.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Polymorphism relates to the ability of a language to have different object treated uniformly by using a single interfaces; as such it is related to overriding, so the interface (or the base class) is polymorphic, the implementor is the object which overrides (two faces of the same medal)

Generated abstractive summary:
Polymorphism allows a class instance to behave like another class in its inheritance tree. Overriding is when a subclass replaces a method of its superclass. Overloading is when multiple methods with the same name have different parameters.

Extractive summary:
An <strong>override</strong> is a type of function which occurs in a class which inherits from another class. <strong>Overloading</strong> is the action of defining multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters.

Ground truth:
<strong>Polymorphism</strong> is the ability of a class instance to behave as if it were an instance of another class in its inheritance tree, most often one of its ancestor classes. An <strong>override</strong> is a type of function which occurs in a class which inherits from another class. An override function "replaces" a function inherited from the base class, but does so in such a way that it is called even when an instance of its class is pretending to be a different type through polymorphism.

In OO languages, a method is a function associated with an object, while a standalone function is not.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In OO languages such as Object Pascal or C++, a "method" is a function associated with an object. So, for example, a "Dog" object might have a "bark" function and this would be considered a "Method". In contrast, the "StrLen" function stands alone (it provides the length of a string provided as an argument). It is thus <em>just</em> a "function."

The key differences between a method and a function are:

* A function is a standalone piece of code called by name, with explicit data passed and returned.
* A method is a piece of code associated with an object, with implicit object access and the ability to operate on class-contained data.

Extractive summary:
It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. A <strong>method</strong> is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. <li>A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. <li>A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).

Ground truth:
A <strong>function</strong> is a piece of code that is called by name. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences: <li>A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. <li>A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).

So your example could be written as follows: BIGBLOCK On the current Python 3 version, you could use <code>subprocess.run</code>, to pass input as a string to an external command and get its exit status, and its output as a string back in one call: BIGBLOCK

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Here is a concise summary of the answer:

Java does not have a reliable destructor, and using finalize() methods is discouraged due to potential issues with the garbage collector. Instead, use an explicit method call for resource cleanup, typically in a try/finally block.

Extractive summary:
Use of finalize() methods should be avoided. They are not a reliable mechanism for resource clean up and it is possible to cause problems in the garbage collector by abusing them. If you require a deallocation call in your object, say to release resources, use an explicit method call.

Ground truth:
Generally, all you need to do is dereference the objects - at least, this is the way it is supposed to work.

Generated abstractive summary:
In Java, there is no traditional destructor, as it's a garbage-collected language. However, you can use a PhantomReference to notify when an object is no longer recoverable and perform cleanup through a separate helper object.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can be notified after an object has been destroyed using java.lang.ref.PhantomReference (actually, saying it has been destroyed may be slightly inaccurate, but if a phantom reference to it is queued then it's no longer recoverable, which usually amounts to the same thing). There is also finalize(), which looks like a destructor but doesn't behave like one.

The SQL Server password is hashed, making it impossible to reverse the hashed string. To verify a user's password, hash the entered password and compare it to the hashed version in the database.

Extractive summary:
If you are verifying the password that a user entered the usual technique is to hash it and then compare it to the hashed version in the database.

Ground truth:
I believe pwdencrypt is using a hash so you cannot really reverse the hashed string - the algorithm is designed so it's impossible. If you are verifying the password that a user entered the usual technique is to hash it and then compare it to the hashed version in the database. BIGBLOCK

SQL Server indexing strategy: Use a single covering index or multi-column index to optimize query performance, as multiple single-column indexes may only utilize one index.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If an index is "covering", then there is no need to use anything but the index. Having multiple indexes, each on a single column may mean that only one index gets used at all - you will have to refer to the execution plan to see what effects different indexing schemes offer. You can also use the tuning wizard to help determine what indexes would make a given query or workload perform the best.

Generated abstractive summary:
Creating multiple indexes on individual columns can improve performance for lookup operations in OLTP systems, but creating a single covering index with multiple columns can improve performance for queries using a static set of columns, at the cost of increased overhead.

Extractive summary:
Creating indexes on single columns is useful for lookup operations frequently found in OLTP systems.

Ground truth:
By putting multiple columns in your index, the optimizer will only have to access the table directly if a column is not in the index. The downside is that doing this can cost a lot of overhead, especially if the data is very volatile. Index tuning is as much instinct as science.

Question: Multiple Indexes vs Multi-Column Indexes
Answer: A multi-column index can be used for queries referencing all columns, whereas single-column indexes can only be used when all referenced columns are in the index, requiring a separate lookup for each column.

Extractive summary:
The multi-column index can be used for queries referencing <em>all</em> the columns:

Ground truth:
The multi-column index can be used for queries referencing <em>all</em> the columns: On the other hand, at most one of the single-column index can be used (it would have to look up all records having Column1=1, and then check Column2 and Column3 in each of those).

Question: Multiple Indexes vs Multi-Column Indexes
Answer: 
Summary: Index selection depends on frequently used queries and group by clauses, with clustered indexes requiring a unique key as the first column, and multi-column indexes being reused for multiple searches.

Extractive summary:
e.g. I guess the answer you are looking for is that it depends on your where clauses of your frequently used queries and also your group by's.

Ground truth:
This article should get you on the right track: One thing to note, clustered indexes should have a unique key (an identity column I would recommend) as the first column. Secondly, if you are creating other indexes on your data and they are constructed cleverly they will be reused. <li>you sometimes search by state only. <li>you sometimes search by state and county. <li>you frequently search by state, county, zip. If you search by zip alone quite a lot then the above index will not be used (by SQL Server anyway) as zip is the third part of that index and the query optimiser will not see that index as helpful. You could then create an index on Zip alone that would be used in this instance.

In object-oriented programming, the key difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy is that a shallow copy copies both values and references, while a deep copy copies values and creates new references to the referenced objects, preventing changes to the original referenced objects from affecting the copied ones.

On Windows, the main differences between mutexes and binary semaphores are: a mutex can only be released by the thread that owns it, while a semaphore can be released by any thread. Additionally, a thread can call wait on a mutex multiple times without blocking, but calling wait twice on a binary semaphore without releasing it will block.

Extractive summary:
On Windows, there are two differences between mutexes and binary semaphores: A mutex can only be released by the thread which has ownership, i.e. A semaphore can be released by any thread. A thread can call a wait function repeatedly on a mutex without blocking. However, if you call a wait function twice on a binary semaphore without releasing the semaphore in between, the thread will block.

Ground truth:
A mutex can only be released by the thread which has ownership, i.e. the thread which previously called the Wait function, (or which took ownership when creating it). A semaphore can be released by any thread. A thread can call a wait function repeatedly on a mutex without blocking. However, if you call a wait function twice on a binary semaphore without releasing the semaphore in between, the thread will block.

To resolve the Oracle ORA-12154 error, follow these steps: 

1. Modify the tnsnames.ora file in the OraHome90 directory to include an entry for your database, using the standard Oracle port (1521) and a servicename_alias.
2. Verify connectivity using tnsping servicename_alias.
3. Create an ODBC DSN using the Oracle ODBC driver and specify the servicename_alias as the Server name.
4. Connect to the database via Access using the ODBC source.

Extractive summary:
Going on the assumption you're using TNSNAMES naming, here's a couple of things to do: <li>Execute tnsping servicename_alias to verify connectivity. Use the servicename_alias as the Server name in the ODBC configuration. <li>At this point you should be able to connect to your database via Access.

Ground truth:
<li>Create/modify the tnsnames.ora file in the network/admin subdirectory associated with OraHome90 to include an entry for your oracle database: <li>Execute tnsping servicename_alias to verify connectivity. <li>Assuming a good connection, create an ODBC DSN using the control panel, specifying the ODBC driver for Oracle of your choice (generally there's a Microsoft ODBC driver at least, and it should work adequately as a proof of concept).

To resolve the Oracle ORA-12154 error, use `tnsping` to verify the TNSNames configuration, and then try connecting with ODBC, TOra, or similar tools like TOAD or SQL*Plus.

Extractive summary:
You can use this to prove your TNSNames is correct before attempting to connect.

Ground truth:
@Warren and @DCookie have covered the solution, one thing to emphasise is the use of <code>tnsping</code>. You can use this to prove your TNSNames is correct before attempting to connect. Once you have set up tnsnames correctly you could use ODBC or try TOra which will use your native oracle connection. TOra or something similar (TOAD, SQL*Plus etc) will prove invaluable in debugging and improving your SQL. Last but not least when you eventually connect with ASP.net remember that you can use the Oracle data connection libraries.

Question: Use 'class' or 'typename' for template parameters?
Answer: As far as I know, it doesn't matter which one you use. They're equivalent in the eyes of the compiler. Use whichever one you prefer. I normally use class.

Summary: The choice between 'class' and 'typename' for template parameters is a matter of personal preference, as both are equivalent to the compiler.

Extractive summary:

To create a summary of the given question and answer, I will extract the key information and condense it into a concise statement.

### Example
Question: Use 'class' or 'typename' for template parameters?
Answer: According to Scott Myers, Effective C++ (3rd ed.), use "class" if T is a class, and "typename" otherwise.

In this summary, I have:

- Removed unnecessary details and context
- Focused on the main advice provided in the answer
- Used a clear and concise format

Extractive summary:
According to Scott Myers, Effective C++ (3rd ed.)

Ground truth:
Advice is to use "class" if it is expected T will always be a class, with "typename"  if other types (int, char* whatever) may be expected.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
To use 'class' or 'typename' for template parameters, 'class' is preferred due to its unambiguous meaning in templates.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In response to Mike B, I prefer to use 'class' as, within a template, 'typename' has an overloaded meaning, but 'class' does not. <code>larger_integer_t</code> is a dependent name, so it requires 'typename' to preceed it so that the parser can recognize that <code>larger_integer_t</code> is a type. <strong>class</strong>, on the otherhand, has no such overloaded meaning.

A reverse proxy is a proxy that is deployed as a web server and behaves like a web server, with the exception that instead of locally composing the content from programs and disk, it forwards the request to an origin server. From the client perspective it IS a web server, so the user experience is completely transparent.

Question: Why doesn't "cd" work in a shell script?
Answer: Shell scripts are run inside a subshell, and each subshell has its own concept of what the current directory is. The <code>cd</code> succeeds, but as soon as the subshell exits, you're back in the interactive shell and nothing ever changed there. One way to get around this is to use an alias instead.

When iterating over arguments in a Bash script, use "$@" to access all arguments, which treats each word as a separate argument, and works well with arguments containing spaces.

Generated abstractive summary:
When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the following issues: 

- Lazy loaded objects are subclasses and may return false for getClass() and may have null fields, so use instanceof for equals and getters for hashCode and equals.
- Saving an object will change its state, so don't use an id field in hashCode but it's okay to use it in equals.
- hashCode should use a non-changing subset of properties from equals to avoid collisions.

Extractive summary:
<strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> <strong>Saving an object will change its state</strong> Don't use an id field in <code>hashCode()</code>. But you can use it in <code>equals()</code>.

Ground truth:
<strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return <code>false</code>.

Summary: The issue is due to the regex matching a substring, not the full string, and can be fixed by adjusting the regex to look for the start and end of the string.

Extractive summary:
It is matching because it is finding "a match" not a match of the full string. You can fix this by changing your regexp to specifically look for the beginning and end of the string.

Ground truth:
You can fix this by changing your regexp to specifically look for the beginning and end of the string.

This data would not be available unless an instance of the class has been created.

Ground truth:
if a method is not static, that "tells" the compiler that the method requires access to instance-level data in the class, (like a non-static field). This data would not be available unless an instance of the class has been created. If in fact the method does NOT reference any non-static member of the class, make the method static.

The Quake source code uses Newton's approximation function to calculate the square root of an integer. The function converts the integer to a float, applies a pre-calculated seed value, and iterates the approximation function to achieve a precise result. This method reduces the number of division operations, making it faster than the naive approach.

It should be usable and might even be faster, it's from one of the phenomenal id software's game! This should be faster because it reduces the number of division operations done in naive square rooting down to a simple divide by 2 (actually a <code>* 0.5F</code> multiply operation) and replace it with a few fixed number of multiplication operations instead.

Summary: The .NET Dictionary is preferred over Hashtable due to its generic type, offering static type checking and reduced boxing.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In .NET, the difference between <code>Dictionary&lt;,&gt;</code> and <code>HashTable</code> is primarily that the former  is a generic type, so you get all the benefits of generics in terms of static type checking (and reduced boxing, but this isn't as big as people tend to think in terms of performance - there is a definite memory cost to boxing, though).

Generated abstractive summary:
Here is a concise summary of the difference between binary semaphore and mutex:

Binary semaphores and mutexes are theoretically equivalent but have different practical implementations and services. Mutexes are a lightweight synchronization mechanism, typically used for exclusive access to a resource for short periods, while semaphores are a synchronized data structure with a count, used to block tasks until something is ready. The main difference lies in the system services surrounding the data structure, with mutexes using a test-and-set mechanism and semaphores interacting with the scheduler.

Extractive summary:
In practice, the implementation is different and they offer slightly different services. In the case of a binary semaphore the main practical difference between the two is the nature of the system services surrounding the actual data structure.

Ground truth:
The practical difference (in terms of the system services surrounding them) is that the implementation of a mutex is aimed at being a more lightweight synchronisation mechanism. A typical mutex implementation has a process or thread executing the test-and-set instruction and evaluating whether anything else had set the mutex. A semaphore is a synchronised data structure (typically using a mutex) that has a count and some system call wrappers that interact with the scheduler in a bit more depth than the mutex libraries would.

The problem is that you're calling <code>List&lt;T&gt;.Reverse()</code> which returns <code>void</code>. (The difference here is that it's calling the <code>Enumerable.Reverse&lt;T&gt;()</code> extension method, instead of the <code>List&lt;T&gt;.Reverse()</code> instance method.)

The approach to returning multiple values from a C++ function depends on the values' relationship and size, suggesting using a struct or class instance for related values, refactoring into two functions for unrelated values, or using a pointer or reference parameters for large values.

Extractive summary:
<li>If they're not really related and can't be grouped into a class/struct then perhaps you should refactor your method into two. <li>Depending upon the in-memory size of the values you're returning, you may want to return a pointer to a class instance or struct, or use reference parameters.

Ground truth:
It's entirely dependent upon the actual function and the meaning of the multiple values, and their sizes: <li>If they're related as in your fraction example, then I'd go with a struct or class instance. <li>If they're not really related and can't be grouped into a class/struct then perhaps you should refactor your method into two. <li>Depending upon the in-memory size of the values you're returning, you may want to return a pointer to a class instance or struct, or use reference parameters.

The fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer is by checking the last few digits of the number modulo a large number (such as 110880), which reduces the possible remainders to a small percentage, making it potentially faster than using a square root operation.

Extractive summary:
<code>n % m</code> can be used to rule out some percentage of numbers from being perfect squares.

Ground truth:
The last <code>d</code> digits (in base <code>b</code>) of a number <code>n</code> is the same as the remainder when <code>n</code> is divided by <code>b</code><code>d</code>, ie. in C notation <code>n % pow(b, d)</code>. 1.8% of remainders as possible squares. So depending on the cost of a modulus operation (ie. division) and a table lookup versus a square root on your machine, using this modulus might be faster. 110880 32-bit words is not much RAM these days and fetching a machine word is going to be faster than fetching a single bit.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

To determine if an integer's square root is an integer, check if it can be decomposed into a product of squares of prime numbers. This can be done by testing if the square of each prime number (up to 2^32) divides the input number, removing the square from the number as long as it's possible. If the result is 1, the number is a perfect square.

Extractive summary:
So what you want is to see if a number can be decomposed as a product of squares of prime numbers. If it does then it divides the number by the square as long as it is possible, to remove this square from the prime decomposition.If by this process, we came to 1, then the input number was a decomposition of square of prime numbers.

Ground truth:
If every factor of the decomposition is even, then the number is a perfect square. First build a table of squares of prime numbers which are lower than 2^32. A solution would then be like this: BIGBLOCK Given nowadays' sqrt done in hardware and the need to compute prime numbers here, I guess this solution is way slower. But it should give better results than solution with sqrt which won't work over 2^54, as says mrzl in his answer.

A proxy server acts on behalf of another computer, typically in web scenarios, while a reverse proxy server acts on behalf of a website, making it invisible to clients. 

A forward proxy server is used by clients to access a website when direct access is blocked, such as by an administrator or due to hacking attempts. 

A reverse proxy server is used by a website to handle traffic, distributing it to multiple servers and protecting the main server from public exposure.

Extractive summary:
First of all, the word "proxy" describes someone or something acting on behalf of someone else. In the computer realm, we are talking about one server acting on the behalf of another computer. The proxy event, in this case, is that the "forward proxy" retrieves data from another web site on behalf of the original requestee. REVERSE proxy

Ground truth:
What is different this time compared to a "forward proxy," is that this time the user <code>X</code> does not know he is accessing <code>Z</code>, because the user <code>X</code> only sees he is communicating with <code>Y</code>. The server <code>Z</code> is invisible to clients and only the reverse proxy <code>Y</code> is visible externally. A reverse proxy requires no (proxy) configuration on the client side.

Question: What is the "continue" keyword and how does it work in Java?
Answer: 
The "continue" keyword in Java allows for early termination of a loop's processing, avoiding deeply-nested if statements. It can be used with or without a label to re-execute from the innermost loop or a specified loop, respectively.

Extractive summary:
It is often used to early-terminate a loop's processing and thereby avoid deeply-nested <code>if</code> statements.

Ground truth:
A <code>continue</code> statement without a label will re-execute from the condition the innermost <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> loop, and from the update expression of the innermost <code>for</code> loop. It is often used to early-terminate a loop's processing and thereby avoid deeply-nested <code>if</code> statements. Sometimes <code>continue</code> is also used as a placeholder in order to make an empty loop body more clear.

The fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer is achieved by using a three-step approach:

1.  Filter out obvious non-square numbers (negative numbers, last 4 bits, and specific residue values).
2.  Check if the number is a square modulo 255 by using a precomputed table.
3.  If not, use a modified version of Hensel's lemma to iteratively refine the square root, starting with a precomputed initial value and dividing out powers of 2 to reduce the search space.

This approach is reported to be ~35% faster than other methods, although results may vary depending on the CPU and programming language used.

Extractive summary:
My approach is threefold: <li>Finally, try to compute the square root using a method similar to Hensel's lemma.

Ground truth:
I figured out a method that works ~35% faster than your 6bits+Carmack+sqrt code, at least with my CPU (x86) and programming language (C/C++). <li>First, filter out obvious answers. This includes negative numbers and looking at the last 4 bits. <li>Next, check if it's a square modulo 255 = 3 * 5 * 17.

Question: What's the difference between fill_parent and wrap_content?
Answer: 
Summary: The main difference between `fill_parent` (deprecated and renamed `MATCH_PARENT` in API Level 8 and higher) and `wrap_content` is how they determine the size of a View or Layout: `fill_parent` expands to take up all available space, while `wrap_content` expands only to fit its contents.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It's used to set a View or Layouts size based on either it's contents or the size of it's parent layout rather than explicitly specifying a dimension. <strong><code>fill_parent</code></strong> (deprecated and renamed <code>MATCH_PARENT</code> in API Level 8 and higher) Setting the layout of a widget to fill_parent will force it to expand to take up as much space as is available within the layout element it's been placed in. Setting a top level layout or control to fill_parent will force it to take up the whole screen. <strong><code>wrap_content</code></strong> Setting a View's size to wrap_content will force it to expand only far enough to contain the values (or child controls) it contains. For layout elements it will resize the layout to fit the controls / layouts added as its children.

The "right" way to iterate through an array in Ruby is by using the enumerable mixin and the each_slice method, but it can cause issues with recursive arrays or hashes.

However, this does cause problems when you have a recursive array or a hash with array values.

Ground truth:
If you use the enumerable mixin (as Rails does) you can do something similar to the php snippet listed. Just use the each_slice method and flatten the hash.

Summary: A time_t is a 32-bit signed integer type on legacy platforms but a 64-bit signed int in modern libraries.

Extractive summary:
It's a 32-bit signed integer type on most legacy platforms.

Ground truth:
It's a 32-bit signed integer type on most legacy platforms. However, that causes your code to suffer from the year 2038 bug. So modern C libraries should be defining it to be a signed 64-bit int instead, which is safe for a few billion years.

time_t is a data type in the ISO C library for storing system time values, typically a signed integer representing seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

Extractive summary:
The <code>time_t</code> datatype is a data type in  the ISO C library defined for storing  system time values.

Ground truth:
Such values are  returned from the standard <code>time()</code>  library function. <strong>ISO C defines  time_t as an arithmetic type, but does  not specify any particular type</strong>,  range, resolution, or encoding for it. Also unspecified are the meanings of  arithmetic operations applied to time  values. <strong>Unix and POSIX-compliant systems implement the <code>time_t</code> type as a <code>signed  integer</code> (typically 32 or 64 bits wide)  which represents the number of seconds  since the start of the Unix epoch</strong>:  midnight UTC of January 1, 1970 (not  counting leap seconds). Systems using a  32-bit <code>time_t</code> type are susceptible to  the Year 2038 problem.

Generated abstractive summary:
To create a generic array in Java, you can use the `public Stack(Class<T> clazz, int capacity)` constructor, which requires a Class object at runtime, allowing type information to be available and enabling type checking at the point objects are added to the collection.

Extractive summary:
The public <code>Stack(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz,int capacity)</code> constructor requires you to pass a Class object at run time, which means class information <em>is</em> available at runtime to code that needs it.

Ground truth:
Java generics work by checking types at compile time and inserting appropriate casts, but <em>erasing</em> the types in the compiled files. This makes generic libraries usable by code which doesn't understand generics (which was a deliberate design decision) but which means you can't normally find out what the type is at run time. The public <code>Stack(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz,int capacity)</code> constructor requires you to pass a Class object at run time, which means class information <em>is</em> available at runtime to code that needs it. This then means that you can create an array object of the appropriate type in your constructor, which means that the type of the objects you store in your collection will have their types checked at the point they are added to the collection.

Implementing `Runnable` is more flexible than extending `Thread` as it allows for the ability to run the action in a thread, executor service, or within the same thread.

The options are a lot more open if you just use <code>Runnable</code> than if you bind yourself to <code>Thread</code>.

Ground truth:
One thing that I'm surprised hasn't been mentioned yet is that implementing <code>Runnable</code> makes your class more flexible. If you extend thread then the action you're doing is always going to be in a thread.

Also classes can be dynamically added and removed to an element.

Ground truth:
IDs are unique. Classes aren't. Anywhere you can use an ID you could use a class instead. The reverse is not true.

Question: Difference between div id and div class
Answer: Class styles a group of elements, while ID styles a single element.

Let me know if you need more assistance.

Extractive summary:
Class is for applying your style to a group of elements.

Ground truth:
Class is for applying your style to a group of elements. ID styles apply to just the element with that ID (there should only be one). Usually you use classes, but if there's a one-off you can use IDs (or just stick the style straight into the element).

Here's a concise summary of the given answer:

JavaScript uses a prototype chain to simulate inheritance, where an object's properties and methods are looked up in its own object and then in its prototype chain. The prototype of an object can be accessed using the `__proto__` variable, and adding properties or methods to the prototype benefits from shared memory and facilitates inheritance.

Extractive summary:
prototype chain The prototype of a given instance can be accessed with the <code>__proto__</code> variable.

Ground truth:
The advantage of adding a function / variable to the prototype is that it has to be in the memory only once, not for every instance.

Generated abstractive summary:
Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]], which is used to look up properties if they don't exist in the object itself. The prototype-chain is walked until a match is found or the end is reached. Objects can be created with a custom prototype during object creation using the `new` keyword and the `prototype` property of a constructor function.

Extractive summary:
Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]].

Ground truth:
Just think of constructor functions as classes and the properties of the prototype (ie of the object referenced by the constructor function's <code>prototype</code> property) as shared members, ie members which are the same for each instance.

Generated abstractive summary:
To clone an array of objects in JavaScript, it's challenging to create a deep copy due to potential circular object references. A custom multi-pass cloning method is required to handle specialized data structures with cycles, involving two rounds: 

1.  Clone objects without references to other objects in the array, tracking their origins.
2.  Link the objects together in a second pass.

Extractive summary:
The reason your deep copy is having problems is because you're ending up with circular object references. If you need a deep copy of an Array of Objects with circular references I believe you're going to have to code your own method to handle your specialized data structure, such that it is a multi-pass clone: Keep a track of each object's origins. <li>On round two, link the objects together.

Ground truth:
There is nothing wrong with the way you cloned it...  the same result would occur using Array.slice(). The reason your deep copy is having problems is because you're ending up with circular object references. If you need a deep copy of an Array of Objects with circular references I believe you're going to have to code your own method to handle your specialized data structure, such that it is a multi-pass clone: <li>On round one, make a clone of all objects that don't reference other objects in the array. <li>On round two, link the objects together.

Generated abstractive summary:
To clone an Array of Objects in Javascript, you can implement a recursive function that checks if an object has already been copied, and if not, creates a new copy while maintaining references between objects.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I'd do it with a variable <code>copyCount</code> which increases by 1 every time you copy in your code. An object that has a lower <code>copyCount</code> than the current copy-process is copied. If not, the copy, that exists already, should be referenced. This makes it necessary to link from the original to its copy. You'd have to make a second pass where you set all copy-references to Null.

Not easily done I am afraid.

Ground truth:
The problem is Css cannot replace the arrow in a select as this is rendered by the browser. But you can build a new control from div and input elements and Javascript to perform the same function as the select.

Question: What is the difference between public, private, protected, and having no access modifier?
Answer: In a nutshell, the main difference between access modifiers in C# is the visibility of methods and variables: 
- Public: fully visible from other types/classes.
- Private: only accessible within the same type.
- Protected: like private, but also accessible by derived classes.
- No access modifier: generally as restricted as private.

Extractive summary:
See here:  Access Modifiers. In a nutshell: Public gives the method or type complete visibility from other types/classes. Protected is similar to private except derived classes can also access protected methods.

Ground truth:
In a nutshell: Public gives the method or type complete visibility from other types/classes. Private allows only the type containing the private method/variable access to the private method/variable (note that nested classes  also have access to the containing classes private methods/variables). Protected is similar to private except derived classes can also access protected methods. "Nothing" is VB.NET's equivalent to null.

Generated abstractive summary:
Here's a concise summary of the given answer:

Access modifiers in C# determine the accessibility of classes and members:

- **public**: Accessible by any code in the same or another assembly.
- **private**: Accessible only within the same class or struct.
- **protected**: Accessible within the same class or struct, or in a derived class.
- **internal**: Accessible within the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
- **protected internal**: Accessible within the same assembly or by derived classes in another assembly.
- **No access modifier**: Default access, which is always present, but not explicitly specified.
- **Static**: A class cannot be instantiated, and its members are shared across all instances; a static class can only be accessed through its name.

Extractive summary:
The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct. The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct, or in a derived class. The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly. The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, or by any derived class in another assembly. When <strong>no access modifier</strong> is set, a default access modifier is used. So there is always some form of access modifier even if it's not set. The static modifier on a class means that the class cannot be instantiated, and that all of its members are static.

Ground truth:
<strong>public</strong> The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it. <strong>private</strong> The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct. <strong>protected</strong> The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct, or in a derived class. <strong>internal</strong> The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly. <strong>protected internal</strong> The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, or by any derived class in another assembly. When <strong>no access modifier</strong> is set, a default access modifier is used.

Question: What is the difference between public, private, protected, and having no access modifier?
Answer: 
Summary: In C#, the main access modifiers are public (accessible anywhere), private (only within the class), and protected (within the class or inherited classes).

Extractive summary:
<strong>public</strong> - can be access by anyone anywhere. <strong>private</strong> - can only be accessed from with in the class it is a part of. <strong>protected</strong> - can only be accessed from with in the class or any object that inherits off of the class.

Ground truth:
<strong>public</strong> - can be access by anyone anywhere. <strong>private</strong> - can only be accessed from with in the class it is a part of. <strong>protected</strong> - can only be accessed from with in the class or any object that inherits off of the class. Nothing is like null but in VB.

The square root of an integer can be efficiently checked for being an integer by using the Carmac method with minor optimizations such as checking for 0 after checking for divisibility by 255 and rearranging the division checks to skip the most common cases.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Regarding the Carmac method, it seems like it would be quite easy just to iterate once more, which should double the number of digits of accuracy. Regarding your current best, I see two micro-optimizations: <li>move the check vs. 0 after the check using mod255 <li>rearrange the dividing out powers of four to skip all the checks for the usual (75%) case. Even better might be a simple BIGBLOCK

The fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer is to use a simple hack that uses a single long value as a bit array to eliminate possible squares, reducing the time to about 1/3 of the original method.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The sqrt call is not perfectly accurate, as has been mentioned, but it's interesting and instructive that it doesn't blow away the other answers in terms of speed. So why is it slow? Because Java is actually calling a C routine through JNI, and it's actually slower to do so than to call a Java subroutine, which itself is slower than doing it inline. In C++, I suspect all the complex alternatives would lose on speed, but I haven't checked them all.What I did, and what Java people will find usefull, is a simple hack, an extension of the special case testing suggested by A. Rex.

The fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer is to use a modified Newton's method with Java BigInteger, which works by adding one to the original argument before computing the error. This allows for quick identification of perfect squares and can also calculate floor(sqrt(x)) efficiently.

Extractive summary:
I used java BigInteger and a slightly modified version of Newton's method, one that works better with integers.

Ground truth:
I used java BigInteger and a slightly modified version of Newton's method, one that works better with integers. The problem was that exact squares n^2 converged to (n-1) instead of n because n^2-1 = (n-1)(n+1) and the final error was just one step below the final divisor and the algorithm terminated. It was easy to fix by adding one to the original argument before computing the error. A simple modification also lets you quickly calculate floor(sqrt(x)) instead of the closest integer.

To validate an XML file against an XSD file, use the JDK API for XML validation, specifically calling 'Validator.validate(source, result)' with the source from your writer and result output. Alternatively, use Woodstox with XMLStreamWriter for Stax-based content.

Extractive summary:
Alternatively if you use Stax for writing content (or a library that uses or can use stax), Woodstox can also directly support validation when using XMLStreamWriter.

Ground truth:
One more answer: since you said you need to validate files you are <strong>generating</strong> (writing), you might want to validate content while you are writing, instead of first writing, then reading back for validation. You can probably do that with JDK API for Xml validation, if you use SAX-based writer: if so, just link in validator by calling 'Validator.validate(source, result)', where source comes from your writer, and result is where output needs to go. Alternatively if you use Stax for writing content (or a library that uses or can use stax), Woodstox can also directly support validation when using XMLStreamWriter.

", well, I think the core way (i.e. without powerful syntactic sugar or object oriented power) is to do: But Ruby is all about powerful syntactic sugar and object oriented power, but anyway here is the equivalent for hashes, and the keys can be ordered or not: So, my answer is, "The __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through an array in Ruby depends on you (i.e. the programmer or the programming team) and the project.".

When using .Net's HttpWebRequest.GetResponse(), a 400 (Bad Request) status code raises an exception. To handle this, you can catch the WebException and access the response, or encapsulate the request in a separate method that ignores non-success status codes.

Extractive summary:
You might like to encapsulate the "get me a response even if it's not a success code" bit in a separate method.

Ground truth:
It would be nice if there were some way of turning off "throw on non-success code" but if you catch WebException you can at least use the response:

The error "relation does not exist" in PostgreSQL is caused by an incorrect table name reference, likely due to a case mismatch or missing schema qualification.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One common reason is that the table is defined with a mixed-case spelling, and you're trying to query it with all lower-case. Use double-quotes to delimit identifiers so you can use the specific mixed-case spelling as the table is defined. Re your comment, you can add a schema to the "search_path" so that when you reference a table name without qualifying its schema, the query will match that table name by checked each schema in order. You can check your current schema search path: You can change your schema search path:

Question: ASP.NET Custom Validator Client side & Server Side validation not firing
Answer: 

The CustomValidator will only fire when the input control is not empty. To ensure validation when the control is empty, use a RequiredFieldValidator. Alternatively, omit the ControlToValidate attribute from the CustomValidator and set up validation functions to handle empty controls.

Extractive summary:
Rather than using a separate <code>RequiredFieldValidator</code>, you could omit the <code>ControlToValidate</code> attribute from the <code>CustomValidator</code> and setup your validation functions to do something like this:

Ground truth:
Your <code>CustomValidator</code> will only fire when the <code>TextBox</code> isn't empty. If you need to ensure that it's not empty then you'll need a <code>RequiredFieldValidator</code> too. Use a  RequiredFieldValidator control to  require the user to enter data in the  input control. If your <code>CustomValidator</code> specifies the <code>ControlToValidate</code> attribute (and your original example does) then your validation functions will only be called when the control isn't empty. If you don't specify <code>ControlToValidate</code> then your validation functions will be called every time.

The key difference between div id and div class is that an ID can be used only once per page, while a class can be used repeatedly. IDs are also useful for targeting elements in JavaScript, creating internal links, and providing self-documentation within the document.

Extractive summary:
The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page.

Ground truth:
The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. In contrast, you must use a class to set up alternating row colors on a table, as they are by definition going to be used more than once. An element with an ID can be the target of a piece of JavaScript that manipulates the element or its contents in some way. Finally, if you make your IDs clear and logical, they can serve as a sort of Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦Â¸Âelf documentationÃ©Â?within the document.

Ground truth:
Yes; the Objective-C method syntax is like this for a couple of reasons; one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying are. This also reduces ambiguity between the order of the method parameters, ensuring that you pass the object parameter first, <em>then</em> the index parameter. In a language such as C++, you would simply overload the number method to allow different data types to be passed as the argument; however, in Objective-C, this syntax allows several different variants of the same function to be implemented, by changing the name of the method for each variant of the function.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
There are three ways to return multiple values from a function in C#: 

1.  Use `ref` parameters to pass a reference to the function and modify the object in the calling code's stack.
2.  Use `out` parameters, which are similar to `ref` parameters but require the function to set the value prior to returning.
3.  Create a custom type that encapsulates both values and return that. This is the most recommended approach.

Extractive summary:
There are several ways to do this.

Ground truth:
You can use <code>ref</code> parameters: Another similar approach is to use an <code>out</code> parameter. The final approach (and the best in most cases) is to create a type that encapsulates both values and allow the function to return that:

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

The key differences between interfaces and abstract classes are:

- Interfaces cannot have concrete implementations, while abstract classes can.
- More than one interface can be implemented by a class, but a class can only inherit from a single abstract base class.
- Interfaces are less rigid than abstract classes, allowing for polymorphic hierarchy and pseudo-multi-inheritance, but also making changes to them breaking changes.
- Interfaces can be applied to value types (structs), which cannot inherit from abstract classes.

Extractive summary:
Interfaces can't have any concrete implementations. More than one interface can be implemented on a class. A class can only derive from a single abstract base class. Structs cannot inherit from abstract base classes.

Ground truth:
Interfaces can't have any concrete implementations. Abstract base classes can. More than one interface can be implemented on a class. A class can only derive from a single abstract base class. Abstract base classes can be modified in v2+ without breaking the API. Changes to interfaces are breaking changes.

Summary: In languages like C# and Java, abstract classes and interfaces have different syntax, but in OO theory, there is no difference.

Extractive summary:

Ground truth:
For languages like C# and Java, there is a difference, but in other languages like C++ there is not. OO theory doesn't differentiate the two, merely the syntax of language. An abstract class is a class with both implementation and interface (pure virtual methods) that will be inherited. Interfaces generally do not have any implementation but only pure virtual functions.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
In .NET and Java, key differences between interfaces and abstract classes are:
- Interfaces have no state or implementation and must be fully implemented by any class that implements them.
- Abstract classes can contain state and/or implementation and may be inherited without implementing all abstract methods.
- Interfaces can be multiple-inherited, while abstract classes cannot.
- Abstract classes can contain default implementations, whereas interfaces do not.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<li>interfaces can have no state or implementation <li>a class that implements an interface must provide an implementation of all the methods of that interface <li>abstract classes may contain state (data members) and/or implementation (methods) <li>abstract classes can be inherited without implementing the abstract methods (though such a derived class is abstract itself) <li>interfaces may be multiple-inherited, abstract classes may not (this is probably the key concrete reason for interfaces to exist separately from abtract classes - they permit an implementation of multiple inheritance that removes many of the problems of general MI). As general OO terms, the differences are not necessarily well-defined.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
The key difference between a function and a procedure in PL/SQL is that a function can be in-lined into a SQL statement, but is restricted to being "pure" (always producing the same output for the same inputs) due to query optimizer architecture limitations.

Extractive summary:
The architecture of the query optimiser limits what can be done with functions in this context, requiring that they are pure (i.e. the same inputs always produce the same output). This restricts what can be done in the function, but allows it to be used in-line in the query if it is defined to be "pure".

Ground truth:
A function can be in-lined into a SQL statement, e.g. BIGBLOCK Which cannot be done with a stored procedure. This restricts what can be done in the function, but allows it to be used in-line in the query if it is defined to be "pure". However, you cannot use a non-deterministic function like this in a correlated subquery as the optimiser cannot predict what sort of result set will be returned (this is computationally intractable, like the halting problem).

Access restriction on a class in Java due to a required library (rt.jar) is not allowed under the Java 2 Runtime Environment binary code license.

Ground truth:
My guess is that you are trying to replace a standard class which ships with Java 5 with one in a library you have. This is not allowed under the terms of the license agreement, however AFAIK it wasn't enforced until Java 5. I have seen this with QName before and I "fixed" it by removing the class from the jar I had. You may not modify the JavaPlatform Interface ("JPI", identified as classes containedwithin the "java" package or any subpackages of the "java"package), by creating additional classes within the JPI orotherwise causing the addition to or modification of theclasses in the JPI. In the event that you create anadditional class and associated API(s) which (i) extendsthe functionality of the Java platform, and (ii) is exposedto third party software developers for the purpose ofdeveloping additional software which invokes suchadditional API, you must promptly publish broadly anaccurate specification for such API for free use by alldevelopers.

The difference between private, public, and protected inheritance is how the public members of the base class are exposed from the derived class, with public making them public, protected making them protected, and private making them private.

Extractive summary:
It has to do with how the public members of the base class are exposed from the derived class.

Ground truth:
<li>public -> base class's public members will be public (usually the default)   <li>protected -> base class's public members will be protected    <li>private -> base class's public members will be private As litb points out, public inheritance is traditional inheritance that you'll see in most programming languages. Private inheritance, something AFAIK peculiar to C++, is an "IMPLEMENTED IN TERMS OF" relationship. That is you want to <strong>use</strong> the public interface in the derived class, but don't want the user of the derived class to have access to that interface.

Here's a concise summary:

There are three types of inheritance: public, protected, and private. 

- **Public inheritance**: All classes that know about the base class are also aware that the child class inherits from it.
- **Protected inheritance**: Only the child class and its children are aware that they inherit from the base class.
- **Private inheritance**: Only the child class is aware of the inheritance, no other classes can access it.

Extractive summary:
There are three accessors that I'm aware of: <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code> and <code>private</code>. <li>If the inheritance is <code>private</code>, no one other than <code>Child</code> is aware of the inheritance.

Summary: The difference between private, public, and protected inheritance is the access protection of base class members in the derived class, with public and protected members accessible in public inheritance, inaccessible in private inheritance, and accessible in protected inheritance and further derived classes.

Extractive summary:
It's essentially the access protection of the public and protected members of the base class in the derived class. With public inheritance, the derived class can see public and protected members of the base. With protected, the derived class and any classes derived from that can see them.

To pass a variable to the next page in PHP, you can use either a hidden form field, add it to the form's action URL, or store it in the session using the `session_start()` function. However, be cautious when passing data from the client-side as it may be tampered with, and validate the data for security purposes.

Extractive summary:
Passing data in the request You could either embed it as a hidden field in your form, or add it your forms action URL or Passing data in the session Security Check it for validity!

Ground truth:
Passing data in the request You could either embed it as a hidden field in your form, or add it your forms action URL Note this also illustrates the use of htmlentities and urlencode when passing data around. Passing data in the session Simply call session_start() at the start of each page, and you can get and set data into the $_SESSION array. Check it for validity! As you are clearly just getting started here, its worth reminding that this goes for any data which arrives in $_GET, $_POST or $_COOKIE - assume your worst enemy crafted the contents of those arrays, and code accordingly!

To pass a variable to the next page in PHP, you can use sessions, cookies, GET, or POST variables. Sessions and cookies store the variable on the server and client respectively, with sessions being more secure. You can use GET variables by adding them to the link, or POST variables by including a hidden field in a form.

Extractive summary:
<strong>GET and POST</strong> You can add the variable in the link to the next page:

Ground truth:
HTML / HTTP is stateless, in other words, what you did / saw on the previous page, is completely unconnected with the current page. <em>Except</em> if you use something like sessions, cookies or GET / POST variables. Sessions and cookies are quite easy to use, with session being by far more secure than cookies. You can add the variable in the link to the next page: This will create a GET variable. Another way is to include a hidden field in a form that submits to page two: And then on page two: Just change the method for the form to <code>post</code> if you want to do it via post.

Otherwise, the port 443 wasn't using SSL and was sending plain HTML back to the browser. If you see plain HTML, your Apache is not using SSL on port 443 at all, most probably due to a VirtualHost misconfiguration.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
They're a core technique (maybe even THE technique) of functional programming, and they're also very useuful in object-oriented programs. I suggest you read up on closures and the map function (that links to python docs, but it exists in nearly every language that supports functional constructs) to see why it's useful.

Python lambdas are useful for passing functions as arguments to other functions, creating function wrappers, and combining elements of an iterable sequence. They can be particularly useful when a list comprehension is not possible.

Extractive summary:
Those things are actually quite useful.

Ground truth:
Python supports a style of programming called functional programming where you can pass functions to other functions to do stuff. (or even as <code>range(3,10,3)</code>), but there are many other, more sophisticated use cases where you can't use a list comprehension and a lambda function may be the shortest way to write something out.

Mercurial and Git are equivalent systems that work with a series of snapshots (changesets) to track history, but they differ in their approach to modifying this history and handling branches. Mercurial has a bias towards non-destructive commands and supports multiple branches, while Git focuses on mutating the history graph and adds names to diverged strands of development.

Extractive summary:
They both work with the same abstractions: a series of snapshots (changesets) which make up the history. So Mercurial has a <em>bias</em> towards non-destructive commands.

Ground truth:
I work on Mercurial, but fundamentally I believe both systems are equivalent. Git has a strong focus on mutating this history graph (with all the consequences that entails) whereas Mercurial does not encourage history rewriting, but it's easy to do anyway and the consequences of doing so are exactly what you should expect them to be (that is, if I modify a changeset you already have, your client will see it as new if you pull from me). I chose Mercurial since it feels clean and elegant -- I was put off by the shell/Perl/Ruby scripts I got with Git. I like the blog post that compares Mercurial and Git with James Bond and MacGyver -- Mercurial is somehow more low-key than Git.

Answer: A LEFT JOIN includes all records from the first table, even if there are no corresponding records in the right table, potentially yielding different results than multiple tables on the FROM line.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Well the first and second queries may yield different results because a LEFT JOIN includes all records from the first table, even if there are no corresponding records in the right table.

To create a summary, I will focus on the key information and remove unnecessary details.

### Example
Question: SQL left join vs multiple tables on FROM line?
Answer: When you need an outer join, the second syntax is not always required, as a join is more natural than adding an expression to a where clause.

This summary captures the main point of the answer, omitting the specific database examples and unnecessary details.

Extractive summary:
When you need an outer join the second syntax is <strong>not</strong> always required: BIGBLOCK BIGBLOCK

Ground truth:
When you need an outer join the second syntax is <strong>not</strong> always required: I don't know the answer, but it is probably related to the fact that a <strong>join</strong> is more natural (syntactically, at least) than adding an expression to a <strong>where</strong> clause when you are doing exactly that: <strong>joining</strong>.

Generated abstractive summary:
The second method of writing a join in the FROM line is preferred as it reduces the risk of accidental cross joins and is more maintainable.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The second is preferred because it is far less likely to result in an accidental cross join by forgetting to put inthe where clause. A join with no on clause will fail the syntax check, an old style join with no where clause will not fail, it will do a cross join.

### Example
Question: SQL left join vs multiple tables on FROM line?
Answer: 

SQL left join is more readable than listing tables in the FROM clause and specifying join criteria in the WHERE clause, as it keeps the WHERE clause for resultset restrictions and improves query readability.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Basically, when your FROM clause lists tables like so: BIGBLOCK the result is a cross product of all the rows in tables A, B, C. Then you apply the restriction <code>WHERE tableA.id = tableB.a_id</code> which will throw away a huge number of rows, then further ... <code>AND tableB.id = tableC.b_id</code> and you should then get only those rows you are really interested in. Using the JOIN notation makes the SQL statement <em>more</em> readable (IMHO, not using joins turns the statement into a mess). Using the cross product, you need to provide join criteria in the WHERE clause, and that's the problem with the notation. You should definitely use JOINs and keep the FROM clause a FROM clause, and the WHERE clause a WHERE clause.

Ground truth:
The JOIN syntax is harder to write (at the beginning), but it makes it explicit what criteria affects which tables. Also, if all the joins are INNER, then both versions are equivalent.

The old SQL syntax for left join and multiple tables in the FROM clause is being deprecated in favor of the new syntax, which allows for more explicit join ordering and filtering.

Extractive summary:
Enter the new syntax, with this you can choose.

Ground truth:
The old syntax, with just listing the tables, and using the <code>WHERE</code> clause to specify the join criteria, is being deprecated in most modern databases. It's not just for show, the old syntax has the possibility of being ambiguous when you use both INNER and OUTER joins in the same query. So the old syntax is ambiguous. Enter the new syntax, with this you can choose. Additionally, the old way, by throwing a bunch of tables at the query optimizer, with a bunch of WHERE clauses, was akin to saying "here you are, do the best you can". With the new syntax, the query optimizer has less work to do in order to figure out what parts goes together.

Generated abstractive summary:
The `transient` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized. This is useful for fields that are derived programmatically, such as thumbnails, and should not be persisted via serialization, reducing storage needs.

Extractive summary:
The <code>transient</code> keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized. Variables may be marked <code>transient</code> to  indicate that they are not part of the  persistent state of an object. For example, you may have fields that are derived from other fields, and should only be done so programmatically, rather than having the state be persisted via serialization.

Question: Why does Java have transient fields?
Answer: The `transient` modifier in Java indicates that a field should not be serialized or persisted, making its value available only in the current VM memory space.

Extractive summary:
don't persist or move it outside of this particular VM in any way. i.e.

Ground truth:
Serialization systems other than the native java one can also use this modifier. Hibernate, for instance, will not persist fields marked with either <strong>@Transient</strong> or the <strong>transient</strong> modifier. I believe the figurative meaning of the modifier is "this field is for in-memory use only. Its non-portable". i.e. you can't rely on its value in another VM memory space.

An application server is a machine that listens for requests and performs actions based on them, while a web server is a process that listens on the TCP/IP channel and typically returns HTML web pages in response to client requests.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
An application server is a machine (an executable process running on some machine, actually) that "listens" (on any channel, using any protocol), for requests from clients for whatever service it provides, and then does something based on those requests. A Web server is process running on a machine that "listens" specifically on TCP/IP Channel using one of the "internet" protocols, (http, https, ftp, etc..)  and does whatever it does based on those incoming requests... Generally, (as origianly defined), it fetched/generated and returned an html web page to the client, either fetched from a static html file on the server, or constructed dynamically based on parameters in the incoming client request.

Here's a concise summary of the given answer:

The key differences between an application server and a web server are:

- Web servers serve HTTP content, while application servers can support multiple protocols.
- Web servers primarily serve static content, while application servers support dynamic content and additional features like connection pooling and transaction support.
- Application servers often include a web server as a component, allowing them to serve static content as well.
- In production environments, web servers are often used as reverse proxies to application servers, serving static content and forwarding dynamic requests.

Extractive summary:
Following are some of the key differences in features of Web Server and Application Server: <li>As web servers are well suited for static content and app servers for dynamic content, most of the production environments have web server acting as reverse proxy to app server.

Ground truth:
Most of the times these terms Web Server and Application server are used interchangeably. <li>Web Server is designed to serve HTTP Content. App Server can also serve HTTP Content but is not limited to just HTTP. <li>Web Server is mostly designed to serve static content, though most Web Servers have plugins to support scripting languages like Perl, PHP, ASP, JSP etc. through which these servers can generate dynamic HTTP content. <li>Most of the application servers have Web Server as integral part of them, that means App Server can do whatever Web Server is capable of. <li>As web servers are well suited for static content and app servers for dynamic content, most of the production environments have web server acting as reverse proxy to app server.

The distinction between application server and web server is a fuzzy one, with the two categories historically blending features and effectively merging. Today, the term "App Server" is a superset of "web server", with both terms often referring to the same product, differing only in emphasis.

Extractive summary:
Some history. And the lines began to blur. At this point the line between "app server" and "web server" is a fuzzy one.

Ground truth:
Historically, they were different, but through the 90's these two previously distinct categories blended features and effectively merged. At this point is is probably best to imagine that the "App Server" product category is a strict superset of the "web server" category. Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads, more concurrency, and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability. When someone says "web server" you often think HTTP-centric, web UI, oriented apps. When someone says "App server" you may think "heavier loads, enterprise features, transactions and queuing, multi-channel communication (HTTP + more).

The error "The ConnectionString property has not been initialized" occurs when a data source cannot find a connection string. This can be resolved by ensuring the connection string is properly assigned in the code, either programmatically or in the web.config file.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You get this error when a datasource attempts to bind to data but cannot because it cannot find the connection string. If you are programmatically assigning a datasource (such as a SqlDataSource) or creating a query (i.e. using a SqlConnection/SqlCommand combination), make sure you assigned it a ConnectionString. If you are hooking up a databound element to a datasource (i.e. a GridView or ComboBox to a SqlDataSource), make sure the datasource is assigned to one of your connection strings. Try replacing that with <code>ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ConnectionString"].ConnectionString</code> (if ConnectionString is the name of your connection string.)

Question: How to fix "The ConnectionString property has not been initialized"
Answer: To fix the error, reference the connection string by name using `ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["MyDB"].ConnectionString`.

Extractive summary:
Referencing the connection string should be done as such: <code>ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["MyDB"].ConnectionString</code> instructs to look for the connection string named "MyDB".

Ground truth:
<code>ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ConnectionString"]</code> would be looking in the <code>AppSettings</code> for something named <code>ConnectionString</code>, which it would not find. This is why your error message indicated the <code>"ConnectionString" property has not been initialized</code>, because it is looking for an initialized property of <code>AppSettings</code> named <code>ConnectionString</code>.

Generated abstractive summary:
The issue lies in the fact that the width and height variables are set locally in JFrame, but the DrawCircle class is trying to access them as fields. To fix this, the width and height fields should be declared in JFrame, and getters should be created for them. Alternatively, the DrawCircle class can be refactored to take the width and height as parameters in its constructor.

Extractive summary:
ThatÃ©ÂºÂs because you are not setting the width and height fields in JFrame, but you are setting them on local variables. Then, you could create a Constructor that receives both values as parameters In DrawFrame I set width and height. In DrawCircle I need to access the  width and height of DrawFrame.

Ground truth:
Fields HEIGHT and WIDTH are inhereted from ImageObserver BIGBLOCK If width and height represent state of the frame, then you could refactorize them to fields, and write getters for them. Then, you could create a Constructor that receives both values as parameters BIGBLOCK If widht and height are going to be constant (after created) then you should use the <strong>final</strong> modifier. Also, the variables i use in  DrawCircle, should I have them in the  constructor or not? The way it is writen now, will only allow you to create <strong>one type of circle</strong>. If you wanÃ©ÂºÂt to create different circles, you should overload the constructor with one with arguments).

Question: What is (functional) reactive programming?
Answer: 
Reactive programming is a concept that combines dataflow computing and external stimuli to trigger a series of computations. It's well-suited for UI design, where user interactions (e.g., touching a control) trigger updates in various display items and application components. Functional reactive programming is the implementation of this idea within a functional programming paradigm, where nodes in a directed graph perform simple computations and trigger other nodes when their outputs are available. This approach is asynchronous and event-driven, allowing for efficient execution and handling of external inputs.

Extractive summary:
This is pretty well suited to UI design, for example, in which touching a user interface control (say, the volume control on a music playing application) might need to update various display items and the actual volume of audio output. The application "reacts" to the user stimulus. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation.

Ground truth:
OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external "stimuli" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs "triggered" or "marked". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Reactive programming imports this "cascade of execution" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the "outside world" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs "reacts" to them. Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.

Functional reactive programming combines functional programming and reactive programming, allowing for side-effect-free code with changing values over time, represented by datatypes that update automatically.

Extractive summary:
This is the combination of functional programming, and reactive programming. The basic idea behind reactive programming is that there are certain datatypes that represent a value "over time".

Ground truth:
One way to get side-effect like behavior while still retaining a functional style is to use functional reactive programming. This is the combination of functional programming, and reactive programming. The basic idea behind reactive programming is that there are certain datatypes that represent a value "over time". This is why reactive programming and functional programming work so well together: reactive programming removes the need to mutate variables while still letting you do a lot of what you could accomplish with variable mutations.

Generated abstractive summary:
Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a paradigm that captures dynamic values directly, allowing for continuous and concurrent computation without the complexity of imperative concurrency. It represents values as functions of continuous time, making it suitable for modeling behaviors and events that evolve over time. FRP is characterized by its use of behaviors, events, and compositional vocabulary, and can be understood through denotational semantics, which provides a precise and mathematical foundation for its principles.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
So, what is FRP?You could have invented it yourself.Start with these ideas: <li>Dynamic/evolving values (i.e., values "over time") are first class values in themselves. <li>Behaviors are built up out of a few primitives, like constant (static) behaviors and time (like a clock), and then with sequential and parallel combination. <li>To account for discrete phenomena, have another type (family) of "events", each of which has a stream (finite or infinite) of occurrences. <li>To come up with the compositional vocabulary out of which all behaviors and events can be built, play with some examples. <li>So that you know you're on solid ground, give the whole model a compositional foundation, using the technique of denotational semantics, which just means that (a) each type has a corresponding simple &amp; precise mathematical type of "meanings", and (b) each primitive and operator has a simple &amp; precise meaning as a function of the meanings of the constituents.<em>Never, ever</em> mix implementation considerations into your exploration process. If you stick with these principles, I expect you'll get something more-or-less in the spirit of FRP. It's been quite a challenge to implement this model correctly and efficiently, but that's another story.

In Perl, boolean variables are not native, but can be achieved through integer or string comparisons, or using the 'true' and 'false' constants defined with 'use constant'.

Extractive summary:
Perl doesn't have a native boolean type, but you can use comparison of integers or strings in order to get the same behavior.

Ground truth:
Perl doesn't have a native boolean type, but you can use comparison of integers or strings in order to get the same behavior. Alan's example is a nice way of doing that using comparison of integers. One thing that I've done in some of my programs is added the same behavior using a constant: BIGBLOCK I saw that in one of the comments you asked about comparing strings. You should know that because Perl combines strings and numeric types in scalar variables, you have different syntax for comparing strings and numbers: BIGBLOCK

Here is a concise summary of the given answer:

`extern "C"` in C++ provides 'C' linkage, allowing C code to link to C++ functions using a 'C' compatible header file, by preventing C++ compiler name mangling of function names.

Extractive summary:
<li>extern "C" is a linkage-specification

Ground truth:
extern "C" makes a function-name in C++ have 'C' linkage (compiler does not mangle the name) so that client C code can link to (i.e use) your function using a 'C' compatible header file that contains just the declaration of your function. Since C++ has overloading of function names and C does not, the C++ compiler cannot just use the function name as a unique id to link to, so it mangles the name by adding information about the arguments. If you care about the technicalities, they are listed in section 7.5 of the C++03 standard, here is a brief summary (with emphasis on extern "C"): <li>extern "C" is a linkage-specification <li>Every compiler is <em>required</em> to provide "C" linkage <li>a linkage specification shall occur only in namespace scope <li> all function types, function names and variable names have a language linkage  See Richard's Comment: Only function names and variable names with external linkage have a language linkage <li>two function types with distinct language linkages are distinct types even if otherwise identical <li>linkage specs nest, inner one determines the final linkage <li>extern "C" is ignored for class members <li>at most one function with a particular name can have "C" linkage (regardless of namespace) <li> extern "C" forces a function to have external linkage (cannot make it static)   See Richard's comment:    'static' inside 'extern "C"' is valid; an entity so declared has internal linkage, and so does not have a language linkage <li>Linkage from C++ to objects defined in other languages and to objects defined in C++ from other languages is implementation-defined and language-dependent.

Generated abstractive summary:
The extern "C" keyword in C++ prevents name mangling of a function, allowing it to be accessed directly by its symbol name.

Extractive summary:
So if you specify a function to be extern C, the compiler doesn't performs name mangling with it and it can be directly accessed using its symbol name as the function name.

Ground truth:
Because C++ allows overloading and has many features that C does not Ã©Â?like classes, member functions, exception specifications - it is not possible to simply use the function name as the symbol name. To solve that, C++ uses so-called name mangling, which transforms the function name and all the necessary information (like the number and size of the arguments) into some weird-looking string processed only by the compiler and linker.

To remove an invalid remote branch reference from Git, use the `prune` command with the `--dry-run` option to see which branches will be deleted, or run it without the option to actually delete them. Alternatively, you can use `rm` to remove the remote and its configuration settings.

With --dry-run option, report what branches will be pruned, but do no actually prune them.

Ground truth:
<strong>prune</strong> Deletes all stale tracking branches under &lt;name>. <strong>rm</strong> Remove the remote named &lt;name>. I suspected the OP had done something that left their tree in an inconsistent state that caused it to behave a bit strangely, and <code>git gc</code> was required to fix up the left behind cruft. <em>Usually</em>  <code>git branch -rd origin/badbranch</code> is sufficient for nuking a local tracking branch , or <code>git push origin :badbranch</code> for nuking a remote branch, and <em>usually</em> you will <em>never</em> need to call <code>git gc</code>

Generated abstractive summary:
The Hibernate error "org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException" occurs when two objects with the same identifier value are associated with the session, indicating a primary key conflict. This issue often arises from cascading saves or using a primary key generator that doesn't account for existing objects in the session. To resolve it, identify the source of the conflict, such as a removed row being added again, and update or remove the conflicting object before persisting.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would suggest you break down your code, i.e. comment out bits until the error goes away and then put the code back until it comes back and you should find the error it. The reason I ask is this error is related to how you're telling hibernate to ascertain the persistent state of an object (i.e. whether an object is persistent or not). The error could be happening because hibernate is trying to persist and object that is already persistent.

Question: What is the difference between const int*, const int * const, and int const *?
Answer: Simple Use of const. The simplest use is to declare a named constant. To do this, one declares a constant as if it was a variable but add 'const' before it. It has an advantage over the C preprocessor #define command in that it is understood & used by the compiler itself, not just substituted into the program text by the preprocessor before reaching the main compiler, so error messages are more helpful. It also works with pointers, but one has to be careful where to place 'const' to determine whether the pointer or what it points to is constant or both.

Extractive summary:
Simple Use of __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________const__________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ The simplest use is to declare a named constant. For example, It has an advantage for programmers over the C preprocessor __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________#define__________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ command in that it is understood &amp; used by the compiler itself, not just substituted into the program text by the preprocessor before reaching the main compiler, so error messages are much more helpful.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
To summarize the given answer, here's a concise version:

The difference between const int*, const int * const, and int const * lies in the order of reading pointer declarations from right to left. 

- const X* p means the object pointed to is constant.
- X* const p means the pointer itself is constant.
- const X* const p means both the pointer and the object it points to are constant.

Extractive summary:
You have to read pointer declarations   right-to-left. <code>const X* const p</code> means "p is a const pointer to an X that is const": you can't change the pointer p itself, nor can you change the X object via p.

Ground truth:
<code>const X* p</code> means "p points to an X that is const": the X object can't be changed via p. <code>X* const p</code> means "p is a const pointer to an X that is non-const": you can't change the pointer p itself, but you can change the X object via p. <code>const X* const p</code> means "p is a const pointer to an X that is const": you can't change the pointer p itself, nor can you change the X object via p.

Generated abstractive summary:
The "const" keyword in C++ applies to the thing it follows, not precedes. It can be placed after the type (int const *), before the asterisk (int * const), or before the variable name (const int *), each with a different meaning.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In short, I find the easiest way to remember the rule is that the "const" goes after the thing it applies to. So in your question, "int const *" means that the int is constant, while "int * const" would mean that the pointer is constant.

Generated abstractive summary:
Here's a concise summary of the answer:

There's no perfect way to compare JavaScript objects, but two methods can be used: 
1. A fast but limited method for simple JSON-style objects without methods and DOM nodes.
2. A slow but more generic method that compares objects without prototypes and properties recursively.

Extractive summary:
<strong>1) Fast and limited.</strong> Works when you have simple JSON-style objects without methods and DOM nodes inside: <strong>2) Slow and more generic.</strong>

Ground truth:
Unfortunately there is no perfect way, unless you use <code>_proto_</code> recursively and access all non-enumerable properties, but this works in Firefox only. So the best I can do is to guess usage scenarios. <strong>1) Fast and limited.</strong> <strong>2) Slow and more generic.</strong>

The 'System.OutOfMemoryException' exception doesn't necessarily mean there's no physical memory available, but rather that the system can't find a large enough contiguous block of memory to allocate.

Extractive summary:
In short, and very simplified, "Out of memory" does not really mean that the amount of available memory is too small.

Ground truth:
In short, and very simplified, "Out of memory" does not really mean that the amount of available memory is too small. The most common reason is that within the current address space, there is no contiguous portion of memory that is large enough to serve the wanted allocation.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

The 'System.OutOfMemoryException' occurs when memory is fragmented, preventing allocation of a large contiguous block. Possible solutions include using a 64-bit OS, modifying the algorithm, or allocating smaller chunks of memory.

Extractive summary:
Or switch to 64 bit OS. Or modify the algorithm so it will not need a big chunk of memory. maybe allocate a few smaller (relatively) chunks of memory.

Ground truth:
You don't have a continuous block of memory in order to allocate 762MB, your memory is fragmented and the allocator cannot find a big enough hole to allocate the needed memory.

To create a summary, I'll focus on the main point of the answer, which is the best approach to remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server.

### Summary
Strip time on inserts/updates in the first place or use a user-defined function for on-the-fly conversion.

Extractive summary:
Strip time on inserts/updates in the first place.

Ground truth:
As for on-the-fly conversion, nothing can beat a user-defined function maintanability-wise: The implementation of <code>date_only</code> can be anything you like - now it's abstracted away and calling code is much much cleaner.

To remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server, use a User Defined Function (UDF) if using SQL Server 2005 or lower, or separate the date and time components natively in SQL Server 2008 or higher.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I, personally, almost always use User Defined functions for this if dealing with SQL Server 2005 (or lower version), however, it should be noted that there are specific drawbacks to using UDF's, especially if applying them to WHERE clauses (see below and the comments on this answer for further details). If using SQL Server 2008 (or higher) - see below. If using a UDF, it should be noted that you should try to avoid using the UDF as part of a WHERE clause in a query as this will greatly hinder performance of the query. The main reason for this is that using a UDF in a WHERE clause renders that clause as non-sargable, which means that SQL Server can no longer use an index with that clause in order to improve the speed of query execution. Of course, the absolute <em>best</em> approach for this is to use SQL Server 2008 (or higher) and separate out your dates and times, as the SQL Server database engine is then natively providing the individual date and time components, and can efficiently query these independently without the need for a UDF or other mechanism to extract either the date or time part from a composite datetime type.

To remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server, the most efficient approach is to use the DATEADD/DATEDIFF method, as it is less resource-intensive and avoids language/date format issues. Alternatively, for SQL Server 2008 and later, you can use the CAST function to convert the datetime to a date.

Extractive summary:
I prefer the DATEADD/DATEDIFF because: For SQL Server 2008+, you can CAST to <code>date</code>.

Ground truth:
Strictly, method <code>a</code> is the least resource intensive: Proven less CPU intensive for same total duration a million rows by some one with way too much time on their hands: Most efficient way in SQL Server to get date from date+time? I prefer the DATEADD/DATEDIFF because: <li>varchar is subject to language/dateformat issues <li>float relies on internal storage <li>it extends to work out first day of month, tomorrow etc by changing "0" base For SQL Server 2008+, you can CAST to <code>date</code>. Or just use <code>date</code> so no time to remove.

The best approach to remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server is to use the DATEADD method, which is more robust and suitable for its purpose, despite being slightly slower than a magic number method.

Extractive summary:
This magic number method performs slightly faster than the DATEADD method. Considering the fact that DateAdd is meant for this purpose and is more robust, I'd say use DateAdd.

Asking for the difference between two commits without commits in-between doesn't make sense, as commits are snapshots of a repository. To see changes between two commits, consider using cherry-picking or comparing a commit to its immediate ancestor.

A clustered index stores rows physically on disk in the same order as the index, allowing only one per table, while a non-clustered index contains pointers to rows and can have multiple indexes, but may slow down writes.

Extractive summary:
With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index.

Ground truth:
With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index. Therefore, there can be only one clustered index. With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows. You can have many non clustered indexes, although each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records. It is generally faster to read from a clustered index if you want to get back all the columns.

Here is a concise summary of the answer:

The main types of casts in C++ are: 
- `const_cast` to add or remove const ness 
- `static_cast` for casting between integer types or pointers to related types
- `dynamic_cast` for casting at run-time, particularly for inheritance hierarchies, returning NULL or throwing an exception if the cast fails
- `reinterpret_cast` for casting one type bitwise to another, allowing for potential misuse.

Extractive summary:
dynamic_cast Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy). reinterpret_cast Reinterpret cast simply casts one type bitwise to another.

Ground truth:
const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types. Static cast is also used to cast pointers to related types, for  example casting void* to the appropriate type. Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy).

When creating custom exceptions in Python, it's recommended to subclass from existing exceptions (like ValueError) and handle their variable usage. You can also create a common base class for all exceptions to avoid code repetition. To avoid a deprecation warning, simply rename the "message" variable to something else.

Extractive summary:
But simply calling the message variable something else than message does the trick.

Ground truth:
And if you have many exceptions in your application it's usually a good idea to have a common custom base class for all of them, so that users of your modules can do

Generated abstractive summary:
### Example
Question: What does "connection reset by peer" mean?
Answer: A "connection reset by peer" occurs when a TCP RST packet is received, indicating the connection is closed due to the other end not recognizing it, often caused by the other side crashing or calling <code>close()</code> on the socket.

Extractive summary:
This means that a TCP RST was received and the connection is now closed.

Ground truth:
This means that a TCP RST was received and the connection is now closed. This occurs when a packet is sent from your end of the connection but the other end does not recognize the connection; it will send back a packet with the RST bit set in order to forcibly close the connection. This can happen if the other side crashes and then comes back up or if it calls <code>close()</code> on the socket while there is data from you in transit, and is an indication to you that some of the data that you previously sent may not have been received.

Generated abstractive summary:
The type `long long` in C/C++ depends on the compilation mode, and its usage can be affected by the compiler.

Extractive summary:
It depends in what mode you are compiling.

Ground truth:
long long is not part of the C++ standard but only (usually) supported as extension. If the number is even too big for long the result is implementation-defined (probably just a number of type long int that has been truncated for backward compatibility). In this case you have to explicitly use the LL suffix to enable the long long extension (on most compilers). If the number cannot be represented in long the compiler will automatically try to use long long even without LL suffix.

To convert a byte array to a string and vice versa, explicitly state the encoding, as strings are for text and byte arrays are for binary data.

The "proper conversion" between <code>byte[]</code> and <code>String</code> is to explicitly state the encoding you want to use.

Ground truth:
<code>String</code>s are for text, <code>byte[]</code> is for binary data, and the only really sensible thing to do is to avoid converting between them unless you absolutely have to. If you really must use a <code>String</code> to hold binary data then the safest way is to use Base64 encoding.

EDIT I assumed you meant <code>Object.wait()</code> as your exception is what happens when you try to gain access without holding the objects lock.

Ground truth:
You need to be in a <code>synchronized</code> block in order for <code>Object.wait()</code> to work.

To fix an IllegalMonitorStateException on a wait() call, the object's lock must be held using a synchronized statement, and a while loop is required to check for the wake-up condition.

Extractive summary:
In order to <code>wait</code> or <code>notify</code>/<code>notifyAll</code> an object, you need to be holding the lock with the <code>synchronized</code> statement.

Ground truth:
In order to <code>wait</code> or <code>notify</code>/<code>notifyAll</code> an object, you need to be holding the lock with the <code>synchronized</code> statement. Also, you will need a <code>while</code> loop to check for the wakeup condition (find a good text on threading to explain why).

Based on the provided answer, a concise summary would be:

When calling `obj.wait()`, ensure the current thread holds the mutex for `obj` to avoid an `IllegalMonitorStateException`. Additionally, `thread.wait()` causes the current thread to wait, not the nominated thread; consider using a `CountDownLatch` to pause the thread instead.

Extractive summary:
There are two problems. Specifically, <code>thread.wait()</code> does not cause the nominated thread to wait.

Ground truth:
First, as others have said, <code>obj.wait()</code> can only be called if the current thread holds the primitive mutex for <code>obj</code>. The second (more important) problem is that <code>thread.wait()</code> does not do what you seem to be expecting it to do.

To create a concise summary, I will rephrase the answer to focus on the key information:

Summary: In Python, `isinstance()` is preferred over `type()` for checking the type of an object, as both `int()` and `str()` are also names for their corresponding types.

Extractive summary:
So <code>isinstance()</code> should be preferred over <code>type()</code>.

Ground truth:
Starting in Python 2.2, built-in  factory functions such as <code>int()</code> and  <code>str()</code> are also names for the  corresponding types. So <code>isinstance()</code> should be preferred over <code>type()</code>.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
isinstance checks for inheritance, while type checks for exact identity, making isinstance less bad than type equality checks due to its support for inheritance. The recommended solution is "duck typing", using try/except blocks to check if an object behaves like a certain type. However, basestring is a special case that exists to support isinstance for str and unicode types. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) are also relevant, offering a marker for isinstance and extra functionality in Python 2.6 and 3.0.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
To summarize the contents of other (already good!) answers, <code>isinstance</code> caters for inheritance (an instance of a derived class <em>is an</em> instance of a base class, too), while checking for equality of <code>type</code> does not (it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes, AKA subclasses). For the purpose of this answer, the key thing to retain about ABCs (beyond an arguably more natural placement for TM DP functionality, compared to the classic Python alternative of mixin classes such as UserDict.DictMixin) is that they make <code>isinstance</code> (and <code>issubclass</code>) much more attractive and pervasive (in Python 2.6 and going forward) than they used to be (in 2.5 and before), and therefore, by contrast, make checking type equality an even worse practice in recent Python versions than it already used to be.

Can I increase the heap memory to 75%  of physical memory(6GB Heap). Yes you can.

Ground truth:
Yes you can. In fact, you can increase to more than the amount of physical memory, if you want to. In particular, if the "working set" of the applications and services that are currently running significantly exceeds the available physical memory, your system is liable to "thrash", spending a lot of time moving virtual memory pages to and from disk.

The assert() function is a macro in C++ that evaluates its parameter and takes action if it is false, often aborting the program or throwing an exception. It is typically removed from the compiled code when the DEBUG flag is not defined.

Extractive summary:
The assert() macro returns TRUE  if its parameter evaluates TRUE and  takes some kind of action if it  evaluates FALSE.

Ground truth:
The assert() macro returns TRUE  if its parameter evaluates TRUE and  takes some kind of action if it  evaluates FALSE. One powerful feature of the assert()  macro is that the preprocessor  collapses it into no code at all if  DEBUG is not defined.

The "assert" function terminates a program with an error message if its argument is false, commonly used for debugging to make the program fail more obviously if an unexpected condition occurs.

Extractive summary:
It's commonly used during debugging to make the program fail more obviously if an unexpected condition occurs.

Ground truth:
<code>assert</code> will terminate the program (usually with a message quoting the assert statement) if its argument turns out to be false. It's commonly used during debugging to make the program fail more obviously if an unexpected condition occurs. The corollary of this is that your program should <em>never</em> rely on the assert macro running. From the combination of the program calling abort() and not being guaranteed to do anything, asserts should only be used to test things that the developer has assumed rather than, for example, the user entering a number rather than a letter (which should be handled by other means).

To configure Git over SSH to login once, create a key pair using `ssh-keygen` with a blank passphrase, copy the public key to the remote destination with `ssh-copy-id`, and add the key to `ssh-agent` if it has a passphrase.

Extractive summary:
Then, you copy the public key to the remote destination with <code>ssh-copy-id</code>.

Ground truth:
Unless you have need of multiple keys (e.g. a more secure one with a passphrase for other purposes) or you have some really weird multiple-identity stuff going on, it's this simple:

To configure Git over SSH to login once, run `ssh-agent` and `ssh-add` to unlock your private key, and the agent will sit in memory and automatically use your key for subsequent SSH connections.

Extractive summary:
Try <code>ssh-add</code>, you need <code>ssh-agent</code> to be running and holding your private key The agent then just sits in memory with your key unlocked and loaded, ready to use every time you ssh somewhere.

Ground truth:
Try <code>ssh-add</code>, you need <code>ssh-agent</code> to be running and holding your private key Once you log in, the idea is to run <code>ssh-add</code> once and only once, in order to give the agent your passphrase, to decode your key. On OSX (err, <em>macOS</em>), GNOME and KDE systems, <code>ssh-agent</code> is usually launched automatically for you. I will go through the details in case, like me, you also have a Cygwin or other windows environment where this most certainly is not done for you. There are various ways to automatically run the agent. As the man page explains, you can run it so that it is a parent of all your login session's other processes. Alternatively, you can run the agent as an ordinary child, save the environment settings in a file, and source that file in every shell when it starts. My Cygwin system needed it done manually, so I did this in my <code>.profile</code> and I have <code>.bashrc</code> source <code>.profile</code>: BIGBLOCK You can also just run <code>ssh-add</code> and if it fails start an agent.1.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Configuring Git over SSH to login once involves two methods: using certificates or SSH-Agent. With certificates, you put the private key password instead of the account password. Using SSH-Agent allows you to avoid entering the certificate's password every time by running ssh-agent in the background and adding the passphrase once with ssh-add. Alternatively, keychain and Gnome Keyring offer system-wide solutions that store the certificate's password securely, requiring it only once.

Extractive summary:
You can avoid putting that password using certificates. With keychain you can do the same thing as ssh-agent but "system-wide".

Ground truth:
I think there are two different things here. The first one is that normal SSH authentication requires the user to put the account's password (where the account password will be authenticated against different methods, depending on the sshd configuration). With certificates you still have to put a password, but this time is the password of your private key (that's independent of the account's password). If you want to avoid putting the certificate's password every time then you can use ssh-agent, as pointed out by DigitalRoss The exact way you do this depends on Unix vs Windows, but essentially you need to run ssh-agent in the background when you log in, and then the first time you log in, run ssh-add to give the agent your passphrase. All ssh-family commands will then consult the agent and automatically pick up your passphrase. But this is on that particular shell. With keychain you can do the same thing as ssh-agent but "system-wide".

Generated abstractive summary:
The key difference between an application server and a web server lies in their processing model and session management, with web servers handling requests and simulating sessions through client-server state transfer or external storage, and application servers maintaining explicit sessions as objects in memory.

Extractive summary:
In Application server the session is usually more explicit and often takes form of an object living in memory of the application server for the entire duration of the "session".

Ground truth:
In Web server processing model, the focus is on handling requests; the notion of "session" is pretty much virtual. In Application server the session is usually more explicit and often takes form of an object living in memory of the application server for the entire duration of the "session".

A web server serves web content over HTTP, while an application server is a container for business logic and processes that offers additional services like APIs, object management, and resource management.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
On a first hand, a web server serves web content (HTML and static content) over the HTTP protocol. On the other hand, an application server is a container upon which you can build and expose business logic and processes to client applications through various protocols including HTTP in a n-tier architecture. An application server thus offers much more services than an web server which typically include: <li>A (proprietary or not) API <li>Object life cycle management, <li>State management (session), <li>Resource management (e.g. connection pools to database), <li>Load balancing, fail over...

Here is a concise summary of the answer:

Web servers handle HTTP requests, while application servers handle requests for distributed components, offering features like remote invocation and distributed transactions, and typically support scripting languages like ASP (.NET), Servlet, or PHP.

Extractive summary:
Http server often support some more simple programming environments, often scripting, like ASP (.NET) in case of Microsoft or Servlet--based, including JSP and many other in case of Java or PHP and CGI in case of Apache.

Ground truth:
Web Server -> Programming Environment IIS :                             ASP (.NET) Tomcat :                          Servlet Jetty :                            Servlet Apache :                          Php, CGI Application Servers -> Programming Environment MTS :                                COM+ WAS :                               EJB JBoss :                              EJB WebLogic Application Server :        EJB The crucial difference is that application servers support some <strong>distributed component</strong> technology, providing features like remote invocation and distributed transactions, like <strong>EJB</strong> in Java world or <strong>COM+</strong> on Microsoft platform.

Here's a concise summary:

`@staticmethod` is a function defined inside a class that can be called without instantiation, with an immutable definition via inheritance. `@classmethod` is also callable without instantiation, but its definition follows subclass inheritance, with `cls` as the first argument.

Extractive summary:
It is callable without instantiating the class first. ItÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ definition is immutable via inheritance.

Ground truth:
@staticmethod function is nothing more than a function defined inside a class. It is callable without instantiating the class first. ItÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ definition is immutable via inheritance. @classmethod function also callable without instantiating the class, but its definition follows Sub class, not Parent class, via inheritance.

Summary: The main difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python is how they handle the first argument. @classmethod takes the class of the object instance as the first argument, while @staticmethod takes no implicit arguments.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Below is the usual way an object instance calls a method. The object instance, <code>a</code>, is implicitly passed as the first argument. <strong>With classmethods</strong>, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument instead of <code>self</code>. One use people have found for class methods is to create inheritable alternative constructors. <strong>With staticmethods</strong>, neither <code>self</code> (the object instance) nor  <code>cls</code> (the class) is implicitly passed as the first argument. They behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an instance or the class: Staticmethods are used to group functions which have some logical connection with a class to the class.

Question: What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?
Answer: 
Summary: @staticmethod receives no implicit argument, and can be called on either the class or instance, ignoring the instance except for its class. @classmethod receives the class as an implicit argument, and can be called on either the class or instance, but the instance is ignored except for its class.

Extractive summary:
@classmethod It can be called either on the class  (such as <code>C.f()</code>) or on an instance  (such as <code>C().f()</code>). The instance is  ignored except for its class. A static method does not receive an  implicit first argument. It can be called either on the class  (such as <code>C.f()</code>) or on an instance  (such as <code>C().f()</code>). The instance is  ignored except for its class.

Ground truth:
@classmethod A class method receives the class as  implicit first argument, just like an  instance method receives the instance. To declare a class method, use this  idiom: @staticmethod A static method does not receive an  implicit first argument. To declare a  static method, use this idiom:

There is a semantical and performance difference between SingleOrDefault and FirstOrDefault in LINQ. SingleOrDefault assumes a single item exists and returns it, while FirstOrDefault returns the first item or default if none exist. SingleOrDefault is slower due to its need to check for uniqueness, making it suitable for cases where you're certain there's a single item and performance isn't a concern.

Extractive summary:
There is <li>a semantical difference <li>a performance difference between the two. <strong>Semantical Difference:</strong> <li><code>FirstOrDefault</code> returns a first item of potentially multiple (or default if none exists). <li><code>SingleOrDefault</code> assumes that there is a single item and returns it (or default if none exists). <strong>Performance Difference</strong>

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:

Question: How to Find the Default Charset/Encoding in Java?
Answer: The "file.encoding" property is not a required part of the J2SE platform specification and should not be modified by user code. To change the default encoding, set the locale of the underlying platform before starting the Java program.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Looks like undefined behaviour. The "file.encoding" property is not required by the J2SE  platform specification; it's an internal detail of Sun's implementations and  should not be examined or modified by user code. The preferred way to change the default encoding used by the VM and the runtime  system is to change the locale of the underlying platform before starting your  Java program.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Here's a concise summary of the answer:

The default charset/encoding in Java is initially set to UTF-8, not ISO-8859-1 as expected, due to a bug in the implementation of OutputStreamWriter. It's recommended to always specify the encoding explicitly in the code to avoid relying on the platform default.

Extractive summary:
But of course you should always be specifying what encoding you mean in this code.

Ground truth:
First, Latin-1 is the same as ISO-8859-1, so, the default was already OK for you. When you do that, looks like Charset resets to UTF-8, from looking at the source. That at least explains most of the behavior. I'm guessing it isn't quite dealing with encoding via the same mechanism, which is weird.

Generated abstractive summary:
The default charset/encoding in Java is determined at VM startup, based on factors like the OS default charset or default locale, and may not be cached in all cases.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Looking into the implementation of the classes, it is caused by: <li>Charset.defaultCharset() is not caching the determined character set in Java 5. <li>Setting the system property "file.encoding" and invoking Charset.defaultCharset() again causes a second evaluation of the system property, no character set with the name "Latin-1" is found, so Charset.defaultCharset defaults to "UTF-8". <li>The OutputStreamWriter is however caching the default character set and is probably used already during VM initialization, so that its default character set diverts from Charset.defaultCharset() if the system property "file.encoding" has been changed at runtime.

POSIX is a set of standards for an ideal Unix operating system, providing a standard environment for programmers, users, and administrators.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
POSIX is a set of standards put forth by IEEE and The Open Group that describes how an ideal Unix would operate. Since every Unix does things a little differently -- Solaris, Mac OS X, IRIX, BSD, and Linux all have their quirks -- POSIX is especially useful to those in the industry as it defines a standard environment to operate in. However, the divergent areas of Unix are typically the focus, rather than the standard ones.

Question: How to check if an object is a list or tuple (but not string)?
Answer: 

Instead of checking the type of an object, consider the expected behavior when a string is passed to the function. If a string is passed, is it a bug or an expected behavior, similar to treating a string as a list of characters?

To read a single record from a MySQL database in PHP, use the LIMIT clause to select only the first matching record, ensuring you order the table or use a WHERE clause.

Extractive summary:
So instead, when selecting only one row, make sure you specify the LIMIT clause: This difference requires MySQL to select <em>only</em> the first matching record, so ordering the table is important or you ought to use a WHERE clause.

Ground truth:
Your SQL isn't a good idea, because it will select all rows (no WHERE clause assumes "WHERE 1"!) and clog your application if you have a large number of rows. So instead, when selecting only one row, make sure you specify the LIMIT clause: BIGBLOCK In the simplest case, it's probably sufficient to "cast" the array as an object: Another option would be to instantiate a standard class as a variable, and loop through your array while re-assigning the values: As Edson Medina pointed out, a really clean solution is to use the built-in <code>json_</code> functions:

The environment variable that controls the java.io.tmpdir is java.io.tmpdir, which is typically set to "/tmp" or "/var/tmp" on UNIX systems and "c:\temp" on Windows systems, or can be overridden by the TMP environment variable.

Extractive summary:
The default temporary-file directory is specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. On UNIX systems the default value of this property is typically "/tmp" or "/var/tmp"; on Microsoft Windows systems it is typically "c:\temp".

Ground truth:
The default temporary-file directory is specified by the system property java.io.tmpdir. On UNIX systems the default value of this property is typically "/tmp" or "/var/tmp"; on Microsoft Windows systems it is typically "c:\temp". To specify the <code>java.io.tmpdir</code> System property, you can invoke the JVM as follows: BIGBLOCK <strong>By default this value should come from the <code>TMP</code> environment variable on Windows systems</strong>

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handles the `java.io.tmpdir` path, which is determined by the operating system. On Windows, it reflects the `TMP` environment variable, while on Linux and Solaris, it defaults to `/tmp/`.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It isn't reassuring that there's a way to do this other than on Windows. On Windows, OpenJDK's <code>get_temp_directory()</code> function makes a Win32 API call to <code>GetTempPath()</code>; this is how on Windows, Java reflects the value of the <code>TMP</code> environment variable. On Linux and Solaris, the same <code>get_temp_directory()</code> functions return a static value of <code>/tmp/</code>.

To control the java.io.tmpdir in Java, set the System property "java.io.tmpdir" using the command line option "-Djava.io.tmpdir=/mytempdir" or programmatically with System.setProperty("java.io.tmpdir", "/mytempdir").

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<li>The recommended way to set the temporary directory location is to set the System property called "java.io.tmpdir", e.g. by giving the option <code>-Djava.io.tmpdir=/mytempdir</code> to the <code>java</code> command. <li>If you don't explicitly set the "java.io.tmpdir" property on startup, the JVM initializes it to a <em>platform specific</em> default value. If you care about portability you should explicitly set the system property.

To troubleshoot an Ajax success event not working, add an alert in the success callback to verify it's being called, and check the response using a tool like Firebug to ensure the request was successful (200 OK).

Extractive summary:
Put an <code>alert()</code> in your <code>success</code> callback to make sure it's being called at all. You'll be able to see the response, and whether or not it receives a successful (200 OK) response.

Ground truth:
Reasonable causes could be that a timeout expires, or something in your php code throws an exception. Install the firebug addon for firefox, if you haven't already, and inspect the AJAX callback. You can also put another <code>alert()</code> in the <code>complete</code>  callback, which should definitely be invoked.

urllib2 provides more functionality than urllib, including the ability to specify headers and a Request class for a more declarative approach. However, urllib has the urlencode function, which is not available in urllib2. In general, use the URL opener from urllib2 for new code, but import from urllib for utility functions.

Extractive summary:
The short answer is, unless you're working with legacy code, you probably want to use the URL opener from urllib2, but you still need to import into urllib for some of the utility functions.

Ground truth:
urllib2 provides some extra functionality, namely the <code>urlopen()</code> function can allow you to specify headers (normally you'd have had to use httplib in the past, which is far more verbose.)

JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a technique that allows cross-domain data exchange by appending a prefix to the returned JSON object, which is then eval'd as a JavaScript expression, allowing the server to inject code in the client's browser and bypass same-origin restrictions.

Extractive summary:
Because you can ask the server to append a prefix to the returned JSON object. in order for the browser to <code>eval</code> "inline" the JSON string as an expression. This trick makes it possible for the server to "inject" javascript code directly in the Client browser and this with bypassing the "same origin" restrictions. In other words, you can have cross-domain data exchange. <code>&lt;script src="some_other_domain/some_data.js&amp;prefix=function_prefix</code>>` one can access data from a domain different than from the origin.

Ground truth:
In other words, you can have cross-domain data exchange.

JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a technique that allows cross-domain requests by wrapping server responses in a callback function, allowing JavaScript code to be executed on a different domain.

Extractive summary:
Enter JSONP. Voila, cross-domain requests!

Ground truth:
When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle.

### Summary
Python lambdas are useful for deferring the evaluation of a value until it's needed, allowing it to be computed at the time of use rather than when called.

Extractive summary:
The idea is that the actual value will be computed only at the time when it's going to be used (rather that when it's called).

Ground truth:
One of the nice things about <code>lambda</code> that's in my opinion understated is that it's way of deferring an evaluation for simple forms till the value is needed.

JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a server-side view technology that allows dynamic output and template text in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's compiled into a servlet class and executed by the servlet container, sending the output to the client. 

Servlets are a Java API that intercepts client requests and generates responses, with instances reused for incoming requests. They can be configured to listen to specific URL patterns and access request data and handle responses.

JSF (JavaServer Faces) is a component-based MVC framework built on top of Servlets, providing components via taglibs that can be used in JSP or Facelets. It takes care of HTTP request/response work, allowing for a JSP or Facelets page for the view and a JavaBean class as the model.

Extractive summary:
JSP is a Java view technology running on the server machine which allows you to write template text in client side languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ect.). JSP supports taglibs, which are backed by pieces of Java code that let you control the page flow or output dynamically. JSF is a component based MVC framework which is built on top of the Servlet API and provides components via taglibs which can be used in JSP or any other Java based view technology such as Facelets. This way you end up with basically a JSP or Facelets (XHTML) page for View and a JavaBean class as Model.

Ground truth:
JSP is a Java view technology running on the server machine which allows you to write template text in client side languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ect.). Servlet is a Java application programming interface (API) running on the server machine, which intercepts requests made by the client and generates/sends a response.

- Port number is missing or wrong in JDBC URL
- DB server is down
- DB server doesn't accept TCP/IP connections

Here's a concise summary of the provided answer:

The `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot (forward | sendRedirect | create session) after response has been committed` error occurs when attempting to call `forward()`, `sendRedirect()`, or `sendError()` after the response has been committed. To resolve this, ensure that these methods are not called after the response has been written to, either by adding a `return` statement or using an `else` block.

Extractive summary:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot forward after response has been committed java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot call sendRedirect() after the response has been committed To fix this, you need either to add a <code>return;</code> statement afterwards ... or to introduce an else block. java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot forward after response has been committed

Ground truth:
A common misunderstanding among starters is that they think that the call of a <code>forward()</code>, <code>sendRedirect()</code>, or <code>sendError()</code> would magically exit and "jump" out of the method block, hereby ignoring the remnant of the code. If the <code>if</code> statement calls a <code>forward()</code> and you're afterwards calling <code>sendRedirect()</code> or <code>sendError()</code>, then below exception will be thrown: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot call sendRedirect() after the response has been committed To fix this, you need either to add a <code>return;</code> statement afterwards BIGBLOCK ... or to introduce an else block. BIGBLOCK To naildown the root cause in your code, just search for any line which calls a <code>forward()</code>, <code>sendRedirect()</code> or <code>sendError()</code> without exiting the method block or skipping the remnant of the code. Another probable cause is that the servlet writes to the response while a <code>forward()</code> will be called, or has been called in the very same method. Solution is obvious, just don't write to the response in the servlet.

Binary trees are useful when balanced, with a height difference of less than or equal to 1 between sub-trees. This allows for efficient lookups with a time complexity of O(log N), compared to O(N) in unbalanced trees. Balanced binary trees are used in various applications, including:

* Indexing and searching large datasets
* Database software for disk storage
* Compiling computer languages
* Data compression
* Routing network traffic

However, for small datasets, the advantages of balanced binary trees may not be noticeable, and simpler data structures like binary search trees or even bubble sort may be sufficient.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A non-balanced binary search tree is actually useful for little more than educating students about data structures. That's because, unless the data is coming in in a relatively random order, the tree can easily degenerate into its worst-case form, which is a linked list, since simple binary trees are <em>not</em> balanced. Binary trees become truly useful when you balance them. This involves rotating sub-trees through their root node so that the height difference between any two sub-trees is less than or equal to 1. Of course, they become even more useful when you make them balanced <em>multi-way</em> trees rather than binary tress. That means that each node holds more than one item (technically, they hold N items and N+1 pointers, a binary tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree  with 1 item and 2 pointers). I've written database software optimised for the hardware where a node is exactly the size of a disk block (say, 512 bytes) and you put as many keys as you can into a single node. The <em>pointers</em> in this case were actually record numbers into a fixed-length-record direct-access file separate from the index file (so record number <code>X</code> could be found by just seeking to <code>X * record_length</code>). As to other uses for binary trees, there are a great many, such as: <li>Binary heaps where higher keys are <em>above or equal to</em> lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right); <li>Hash trees, similar to hash tables; <li>Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages; <li>Huffman trees for compression of data; <li>Routing trees for network traffic.

Binary trees have limited applications due to their potential performance issues. However, balanced binary trees like Red-Black trees or AVL trees are more useful, offering O(logn) operations and suitable for implementing maps, sets, and sorting in O(nlogn) time. They are also used in databases, such as B+trees.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Normal binary trees may end up being a list (or almost list) and are not really useful in applications using much data. Balanced trees are often used for implementing maps or sets.They can also be used for sorting in O(nlogn), even tho there exist better ways to do it. Also for searching/inserting/deleting Hash tables can be used, which usually have better performance than binary search trees (balanced or not). An application where (balanced) binary search trees would be useful would be if searching/inserting/deleting and sorting would be needed. It still would be O(nlogn) but with a smaller constant factor and no extra space needed (except for the new array, assuming the data has to be put into an array).

`static_cast` performs no runtime checks for implicit conversions, while `dynamic_cast` performs runtime checks and returns null or throws an exception if the cast fails. Regular (C-style) casts are unsafe, powerful, and allow private base-class casting, but do not use `dynamic_cast`.

Extractive summary:
<code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. Regular Cast These casts are also called C-style cast.

Ground truth:
<code>static_cast</code> is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. <code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering <code>dynamic_cast</code>. After much pulling out of hair I discovered that the <code>foreach</code> loops were the culprits.

Binary trees have applications in evaluating mathematical expressions through a recursive process, where each node's value is determined by its children, allowing for a reverse polish notation-like evaluation order.

Extractive summary:
Basically each node of the tree has a value that is either inherent to itself or is evaluated by recursively by operating on the values of its children.

Ground truth:
One interesting example of a binary tree that hasn't been mentioned is that of a recursively evaluated mathematical expression. Basically each node of the tree has a value that is either inherent to itself or is evaluated by recursively by operating on the values of its children. This use of a binary tree is akin to reverse polish notation in a sense, in that the order in which operations are performed is identical. Also one thing to note is that it doesn't necessarily have to be a binary tree, it's just that most commonly used operators are binary. At its most basic level, the binary tree here is in fact just a very simple purely functional programming language.

Binary trees have various applications, including:

1. Binary Search Tree: Used in search applications with constantly updating data, such as map and set objects.
2. Binary Space Partition: Used in 3D video games for rendering objects.
3. Binary Tries: Used in high-bandwidth routers for storing router tables.
4. Hash Trees: Used in p2p programs and image signatures.
5. Heaps: Used in priority-queues for scheduling processes and implementing efficient algorithms.
6. Huffman Coding Tree: Used in compression algorithms for file formats like JPEG and MP3.
7. GGM Trees: Used in cryptographic applications for generating pseudo-random numbers.
8. Syntax Tree: Constructed by compilers and calculators to parse expressions.
9. Treap and T-tree: Used in wireless networking and database storage.

Extractive summary:
Applications of binary trees <li>GGM Trees - Used in cryptographic applications to generate a tree of pseudo-random numbers.

Ground truth:
To squabble about the performance of <em>binary-trees</em> is meaningless - they are not a data structure, but a family of data structures, all with different performance characteristics. Applications of binary trees <li>Binary Search Tree - Used in <em>many</em> search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the <code>map</code> and <code>set</code> objects in many languages' libraries. <li>Binary Space Partition - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered. <li>Binary Tries - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables. <li>Hash Trees - used in p2p programs and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available. <li>Heaps - Used in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* <em>(path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including robotics and video games)</em>. Also used in heap-sort. <li>Huffman Coding Tree (Chip Uni) - used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats. <li>GGM Trees - Used in cryptographic applications to generate a tree of pseudo-random numbers. <li>Syntax Tree - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions. <li>Treap - Randomized data structure used in wireless networking and memory allocation. <li>T-tree - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so. In a (balanced) binary tree with <code>m</code> nodes, moving from one level to the next requires one comparison, and there are <code>log_2(m)</code> levels, for a total of <code>log_2(m)</code> comparisons. In contrast, an n-ary tree will require <code>log_2(n)</code> comparisons <em>(using a binary search)</em> to move to the next level.

Question: Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?
Answer: Java does not allow overriding of static methods because they are not associated with an instance of a class, and the concept of polymorphism is not applicable to them. This design decision was influenced by performance considerations and the desire to make Java familiar to C++ developers.

Extractive summary:
A static method is not associated with any instance of a class so the concept is not applicable. There were two considerations driving Java's design that impacted this.

Ground truth:
One was a concern with performance: there had been a lot of criticism of Smalltalk about it being too slow (garbage collection and polymorphic calls being part of that) and Java's creators were determined to avoid that. Another was the decision that the target audience for Java was C++ developers.

Java does not allow overriding of static methods because they are treated as global by the JVM and are not bound to an object instance.

Extractive summary:
Static methods are treated as global by the JVM, there are not bound to an object instance at all.

Ground truth:
You can <em>overload</em> static method, that's ok. But you can not <em>override</em> a static method, because class are no first-class object. You can use reflection to get the class of an object at run-time, but the object that you get does not parallel the class hierarchy. A static method is a global function; as a consequence there is also no notion of polymorphism and, therefore, method overriding makes no sense. You can invoke a static method through an object <code>obj1.staticMethod()</code> but that really syntactic sugar for <code>MyClass.staticMethod()</code> and should be avoided.

Java does not allow overriding of static methods because they belong to the class, not instances, and are not inherited by subclasses.

overriding is reserved for instance members to support polymorphic behaviour. static class members do not belong to a particular instance. You may want to define an inerface and research factory and/or strategy design patterns to evaluate an alternate approach.

Generated abstractive summary:
The Java language does not allow overriding of static methods due to design limitations, making it behave counterintuitively in certain scenarios. This can lead to unexpected results, such as in a class with a static method that calculates a bonus multiplier, which does not behave as expected when overridden by a subclass.

Extractive summary:
This code will not work as you might expect.

Ground truth:
Personally I think this is a flaw in the design of Java. My point is not that it creates an unsolvable problem, but that it creates a trap for the unwary programmer, because the language does not behave as I think a reasonable person would expect.

Generated abstractive summary:
In Java, static methods cannot be overridden because it would be ambiguous to determine which method to call at runtime, and it would add redundancy to the language without any benefits.

Extractive summary:
In general it doesn't make sense to allow 'overriding' of static methods as there would be no good way to determine which one to call at runtime. However, all this would do is to re-implement regular class methods, adding redundancy to the language without really adding any benefit.

Ground truth:
In general it doesn't make sense to allow 'overriding' of static methods as there would be no good way to determine which one to call at runtime. In the case of Java, one could imagine a language definition where it is possible to 'override' static methods as long as they are called through an object instance. However, all this would do is to re-implement regular class methods, adding redundancy to the language without really adding any benefit.

Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so. Personally I see the strong points of IoC and I really like them but I tend to avoid IoC whenever possible because it turns your software into a collection of classes that no longer constitute a "real" program but just something that needs to be put together by XML configuration or annotation metadata and would fall (and falls) apart without it.

Question: JavaScript isset() equivalent
Answer: 
The `typeof` operator can be used as an equivalent of `isset()` in JavaScript, returning `"undefined"` if the property doesn't exist or its value is `undefined`. Alternatively, the `hasOwnProperty()` method or the `in` operator can be used, with `hasOwnProperty()` checking if the property exists physically on the object and the `in` operator checking all properties reachable in the prototype chain.

Extractive summary:
It will return <code>"undefined"</code> either if the property doesn't exist or its value is <code>undefined</code>. The <code>in</code> operator will check on all the properties reachable up in the prototype chain, e.g.

Ground truth:
I generally use the <code>typeof</code> operator: It will return <code>"undefined"</code> either if the property doesn't exist or its value is <code>undefined</code>.

Summary: The difference between HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME in PHP is that HTTP_HOST is obtained from the HTTP request header and is client-controlled, while SERVER_NAME is defined in the server config and is server-controlled. However, PHP always returns the value of HTTP_HOST for SERVER_NAME, but this can be changed by setting the UseCanonicalName directive to "on" in the VirtualHost entry of the httpd.conf file.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The <code>HTTP_HOST</code> is obtained from the HTTP request header and this is what the client actually used as "target host" of the request. The <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is defined in server config.

### Example
Question: What is the difference between HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME in PHP?
Answer: 
HTTP_HOST is the target host sent by the client, which can be manipulated by users. SERVER_NAME is more reliable, but can also be manipulated under certain conditions.

Extractive summary:
<code>HTTP_HOST</code> is the target host sent by the client.

Ground truth:
<code>HTTP_HOST</code> is the target host sent by the client. <code>SERVER_NAME</code> comes from the server's <code>VirtualHost</code> definition and is therefore considered more reliable.

A segmentation fault is a type of error caused by accessing memory that doesn't belong to you, often due to incorrect memory management, such as accessing a variable that has been freed, writing to read-only memory, or dereferencing a null or dangling pointer.

Extractive summary:
Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?accessing variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc.

Ground truth:
Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that __oes not belong to you.Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?It__ a helper mechanism that keeps you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Segmentation fault is essentially the same in most languages that let you mess with the memory management, there is no principial difference between segfaults in C and C++. And when you try to dereference dangling pointer (like <code>*p='A'</code>), you would probably get a segfault.

Generated abstractive summary:
In Java, static methods do not allow overriding because they have a fixed signature and do not include an implicit reference to the object itself, unlike virtual methods. As a result, static methods cannot access object variables and methods, making them fundamentally different from virtual methods. This design choice was likely made to improve performance, but it can be confusing for developers coming from languages like Ruby, which have different concepts of static and class methods.

Extractive summary:
Java <code>static</code> methods are not the same as Ruby <code>class</code> methods.

Ground truth:
In a virtual method, the first parameter is implied: a reference to the object itself and when called from within the object, the compiler automatically adds <code>this</code>. There is no difference for static methods - they still have a fixed signature. However, by declaring the method static you have explicitly stated that the compiler must not include the implied object parameter at the beginning of that signature. Because of this difference between the two; virtual methods always have a reference to the context object (i.e. <code>this</code>) so then it is possible to reference anything within the heap that belong to that instance of the object. But with static methods, since there is no reference passed, that method cannot access any object variables and methods since the context is not known. This is just something you will have to accept when working with Java (or C#).

To upload files to a server using JSP/Servlet, use an HTML input field of type "file" in a form with the POST method and enctype set to "multipart/form-data". 

In Servlet 3.0 or later, use the native API with @MultipartConfig annotation and getPart() method. 

In earlier versions, use Apache Commons FileUpload, which requires the commons-fileupload.jar and commons-io.jar in the WEB-INF/lib directory. 

When using Apache Commons FileUpload, avoid calling getParameter() and other methods that read the request body before parsing it, and use FilenameUtils.getName() to fix file name issues with MSIE. 

Alternatively, wrap the upload in a Filter to parse the request automatically.

Extractive summary:
This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. Note the MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name.

Ground truth:
To browse and select a file for upload you need a HTML <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code> field in the form. As stated in the HTML specification you have to use the <code>POST</code> method and the <code>enctype</code> attribute of the form has to be set to <code>"multipart/form-data"</code>. Don't manually parse it! When you're already on Servlet 3.0 or newer, use native API When you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, manually get submitted file name When you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet, use Apache Commons FileUpload Workaround for GlassFish3 bug of <code>getParameter()</code> still returning <code>null</code> Saving uploaded file (don't use <code>getRealPath()</code> nor <code>part.write()</code>!)

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
A bias neuron is a node in a neural network that emits a constant value (1) and is connected to all neurons in the next layer, allowing for the adjustment of the weights without affecting the activation function's value. This enables the network to control the behavior of a layer and represent various boolean functions, including AND, OR, NAND, and NOR, by adjusting the threshold (bias) and input weights.

Extractive summary:
Two different kinds of parameters can  be adjusted during the training of an  ANN, the weights and the value in the  activation functions. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions.

Ground truth:
The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1. Since the bias neuron  emits 1 the weights, connected to the  bias neuron, are added directly to the  combined sum of the other weights  (equation 2.1), just like the t value  in the activation functions.1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions. Perceptrons can represent all of the  primitive boolean functions AND, OR,  NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR).

Generated abstractive summary:
A layer in a neural network without a bias uses a linear function, resulting in an input of all zeros always mapping to an output of all zeros. Adding a bias provides another dimension, avoiding this issue by allowing the weight matrix to map to all possible values.

Extractive summary:
This means that youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe using a linear function and thus an input of all zeros will always be mapped to an output of all zeros. Using a bias, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe effectively adding another dimension to your input space, which always takes the value one, so youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe avoiding an input vector of all zeros.

Ground truth:
Using a bias, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe effectively adding another dimension to your input space, which always takes the value one, so youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe avoiding an input vector of all zeros. You donÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ lose any generality by this because your trained weight matrix needs not be surjective, so it still can map to all values previously possible. Without bias, this straight line has to go through zero, whereas with bias, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe free to put it anywhere.So, youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂl see that without bias youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe facing a problem with the AND function, since you canÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ put both (1,-1) <em>and</em> (-1,1) to the negative side. With a bias, however, itÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂ easy to draw the line.

Question: How does "cat << EOF" work in bash?
Answer: This is called heredoc format to provide a string into stdin. It reads input from the current source until a line containing only a word (with no trailing blanks) is seen, then uses the read lines as standard input for a command. The format of heredoc is: no parameter expansion or command substitution is performed on the word, unless it is unquoted, in which case all lines are subjected to expansion and the character sequence <newline> is ignored.

Extractive summary:
This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from  the current source until a line  containing only word (with no trailing  blanks)  is  seen.

To create a table with the same structure as an existing table, use the SQL command "BIGBLOCK" to copy the table, or generate a "Create Script" of the existing table and use it to create a new table with the same structure.

Extractive summary:
BIGBLOCK You can use that script to create a new table with the same structure.

Ground truth:
BIGBLOCK If you want to copy the <strong>entire</strong> structure, you need to generate a Create Script of the table. If you are using Enterprise Manager, just right-click the table and select copy to generate a Create Script.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Static fields and methods are shared with all instances. They are for values which are specific to the class and not a specific instance. To solve your problem, you need to instantiate an instance (create an object) of your class so the runtime can reserve memory for the instance (otherwise, different instances would overwrite each other which you don't want).

First of all static variables do not belong to any particular instance of the class. Static methods again do not belong again to any particular instance. They can access only static variables. That's why you can use from static methods only static variables. I repeat again they do NOT belong to any particular instance.

The author disputes the notion that singletons are inherently bad, arguing that the criticisms against them are not valid. They claim that hiding dependencies in code is not inherently bad, and that singleton dependencies are easy to identify. They also argue that the Single Responsibility Principle is vague and that singletons can be controlled manually, allowing for the same lifetime as non-singleton objects. Additionally, they suggest that unit tests can be written for singletons with minimal changes to the implementation.

Extractive summary:
Single Responsibility Principle: I think this is a bit vague and depends on your definition of responsibility. Singletons can be created or destroyed manually, so the control is still there, and you can make the lifetime the same as a non-singleton object's lifetime would be. Regarding unit tests:

Generated abstractive summary:
INNER JOINs are generally faster than LEFT JOINs in SQL Server due to the extra work and larger result set of outer joins. However, there are rare exceptions where LEFT JOINs might be faster: very small tables without indexes, where the join operation can be slower due to hashing. In such cases, indexing and index coverage are likely the main performance issues, rather than the type of join.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results. It would also be expected to return more rows, further increasing the total execution time simply due to the larger size of the result set. Reflecting further on this, I could think of one circumstance under which a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> might be faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, and that is when: <li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows); <li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query. If you run this and view the execution plan, you'll see that the <code>INNER JOIN</code> query does indeed cost more than the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, because it satisfies the two criteria above. It's because SQL Server wants to do a hash match for the <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but does nested loops for the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>; the former is <em>normally</em> much faster, but since the number of rows is so tiny <em>and</em> there's no index to use, the hashing operation turns out to be the most expensive part of the query. Because of the size, the hash table version is actually slower. But increase it to 50 elements, or 5000 elements, and the list version slows to a crawl, because it's O(N) vs. O(1) for the hashtable. But change this query to be on the <code>ID</code> column instead of <code>Name</code> and you'll see a very different story. So the conclusion is more or less what I mentioned several paragraphs above; this is almost certainly an indexing or index coverage problem, possibly combined with one or more very small tables. Those are the only circumstances under which SQL Server <em>might</em> sometimes choose a worse execution plan for an <code>INNER JOIN</code> than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.

Since Oracle 9i, there are two ways to declare a directory for UTL_FILE: using the UTL_FILE_DIR parameter in INIT.ORA or declaring a directory object. Directory objects require an exact file path and are more secure, allowing granular user permissions and easier maintenance.

Extractive summary:
Since Oracle 9i there are two ways or declaring a directory for use with UTL_FILE. The alternative approach is to declare a directory object.

Ground truth:
Since Oracle 9i there are two ways or declaring a directory for use with UTL_FILE. The older way is to set the INIT.ORA parameter UTL_FILE_DIR. The value can like any other PATH variable; it accepts wildcards. The alternative approach is to declare a directory object. Directory objects require the exact file path, and don't accept wildcards. In either case, the <code>oracle</code> OS user must have read and/or write privileges <em>on the OS directory</em>. So we cannot use either approach to expose a directory on our local PC to a process running on a remote database server.

The main differences between a binary semaphore and a mutex in Linux are:

- Scope: Mutex is within a process address space, while a semaphore can be used across process space.
- Performance: Mutex is lightweight and faster, with futex being even faster.
- Acquisition: Mutex can be acquired by the same thread multiple times, while a semaphore can only be acquired once.

Ans: Following are the differences __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ ii) Mutex is lightweight and faster than semaphore. Futex is even faster.

Ground truth:
i) Scope __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ The scope of mutex is within a process address space which has created it and is used for synchronization of threads. Whereas semaphore can be used across process space and hence it can be used for interprocess synchronization. ii) Mutex is lightweight and faster than semaphore. iii) Mutex can be acquired by same thread successfully multiple times with condition that it should release it same number of times. Whereas in case of semaphore if same process tries to acquire it again it blocks as it can be acquired only once.

In Ruby, you can get a random number using the `rand` function, which generates a random number between 10 and 42 (inclusive) with `rand(42-10) + 10`. Alternatively, you can use the `Random` class, which was introduced in Ruby 1.9.2, to create a random number generator object and call `rand` on it.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
In most cases, the simplest is to use <code>rand</code> or <code>Random.rand</code>.

Question: Why Response.Redirect causes System.Threading.ThreadAbortException?
Answer: Response.Redirect() throws a System.Threading.ThreadAbortException when endResponse=true, which immediately terminates the current request, but can be avoided by setting endResponse=false.

Extractive summary:
<code>Response.Redirect()</code> throws an exception to abort the current request. If endResponse=true (or if the other overload is used), the exception is thrown and the current request will immediately be terminated.

Ground truth:
<code>Response.Redirect()</code> throws an exception to abort the current request. For <code>Response.Redirect()</code> there exists an overload: If you pass endResponse=false, then the exception is not thrown (but the runtime will continue processing the current request). If endResponse=true (or if the other overload is used), the exception is thrown and the current request will immediately be terminated.

Abstract classes can have static members and can be used without implementation, while interfaces cannot have static members and cannot be used independently.

Extractive summary:
So pretty much you can use abstract class on its own even if it is never implemented (through its static members) and you can't use interface on its own in any way.

Ground truth:
Abstract classes can have static methods, properties, fields etc. and operators, interfaces can't.Cast operator allows casting to/from abstract class but don't allow casting to/from interface.

A Java SecurityException occurs when classes from the same package are loaded from different JAR files with different signatures.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This happens when classes belonging to the same package are loaded from different JAR files, and those JAR files have signatures signed with different certificates - or, perhaps more often, at least one is signed and one or more others are not (which includes classes loaded from directories since those AFAIK cannot be signed). So either make sure all JARs (or at least those which contain classes from the same packages) are signed using the same certificate, or remove the signatures from the manifest of JAR files with overlapping packages.

To summarize the answer in a concise manner:

The issue with `strtotime()` not working with `dd/mm/YYYY` format is due to the separator used between the date components. It should be either a slash (`/`) for `m/d/y` or a dash (`-`) or dot (`.`) for `d-m-y`.

Extractive summary:
Here is the simplified solution: Dates in the <strong><em>m/d/y</em></strong> or <strong><em>d-m-y</em></strong> formats are disambiguated by looking at the separator between the various components: if the separator is a slash (<strong>/</strong>), then the American <strong><em>m/d/y</em></strong> is assumed; whereas if the separator is a dash (<strong>-</strong>) or a dot (<strong>.</strong>), then the European <strong><em>d-m-y</em></strong> format is assumed.

To summarize the answer to the question "Strtotime() doesn't work with dd/mm/YYYY format", the solution is to use DateTime::createFromFormat in PHP 5.3 or use an alternative date format that is supported by strtotime, such as d-m-Y, d.m.Y, or d\tm\tY.

### Example
Question: (None provided)
Answer: You have basically two options here: add the self-signed certificate to your JVM truststore or configure your client to Option 1 Export the certificate from your browser and import it in your JVM truststore (to establish a chain of trust): Option 2 Disable Certificate Validation: Note that <strong>I do not recommend the Option #2 at all</strong>. Disabling the trust manager defeats some parts of SSL and makes you vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. Prefer Option #1 or, even better, have the server use a "real" certificate signed by a well known CA.

Summary: There are two options for handling self-signed certificates: add the certificate to the JVM truststore or disable certificate validation, but the latter is not recommended due to security risks.

You can use a switch statement for substring matching in JavaScript, but it's not recommended. To achieve this, you can use a switch statement with expressions in the case statements that are evaluated at runtime, allowing you to match substrings.

You can't do it in a <code>switch</code> unless you're doing <strong>full</strong> string matching; that's doing <strong>substring</strong> matching.

Question: How to create a generic array in Java?
Answer: 

You can create a generic array using `Object[]`, but this is potentially dangerous and should be used with caution, as it can cause `ClassCastException`s if used unsafely. This approach is safe when used internally, but for returning or exposing the array to client code, use the `Array` class for reflection or consider using `List`s instead.

Extractive summary:
<em>However</em> this triggers a warning because it is potentially dangerous, and should be used with caution. As a rule of thumb, this behavior is safe as long as the cast array is used internally (e.g. Should you need to return an array of a generic type to other code, the reflection <code>Array</code> class you mention is the right way to go.

Ground truth:
You can always do this: <em>However</em> this triggers a warning because it is potentially dangerous, and should be used with caution. Worth mentioning that wherever possible, you'll have a much happier time working with <code>List</code>s rather than arrays if you're using generics.

Question: Do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null?
Answer: 
Objects are automatically cleaned up when no longer in use, but setting to null is sometimes necessary for scope. Dispose objects that implement IDisposable, especially those with unmanaged resources, to avoid memory leaks. Use the 'using' statement for automatic disposal.

Extractive summary:
If the object is <code>IDisposable</code> it is <strong>a good idea to dispose it</strong> when you no longer need it, especially if the object uses unmanaged resources. You can use the <code>using</code> statement to automatically dispose an object once your program leaves the scope of the <code>using</code> statement.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
Objects in C# are managed by the Garbage Collector, which automatically deallocates memory when objects are no longer referenced. Objects created on the heap are not destroyed when they go out of scope, but when the Garbage Collector determines they are no longer needed. The `Dispose` method must be called on objects implementing `IDisposable` when finished with them, typically using a `using` block.

Extractive summary:
They are dealt with by the Garbage Collector automatically when they are not used anymore. <code>Dispose</code> must be called on all objects that implement <code>IDisposable</code> when you are finished working with them. C# Object references

Ground truth:
Objects never go out of scope in C# as they do in C++. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. In practice, you don't have to worry about destruction, it just works and it's great :) <strong>EDIT</strong> On variable scope. To properly explain that aspect of CLR, I'll need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#. In both languages the variable can only be used in the same scope as it was defined - class, function or a statement block enclosed by braces. The subtle difference, however, is that in C#, variables cannot be redefined in a nested block. In C++, this is perfectly legal: BIGBLOCK In C#, however you get a a compiler error: BIGBLOCK Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned. Whenever a C++ variable, allocated on the stack, goes out of scope it gets destructed. In CLR, objects (i.e. reference types) are <strong>always</strong> created on the managed heap. In a way, C# objects are a lot like objects that are created using <code>new</code> syntax in C++ - they are created on the heap but unlike C++ objects, they are managed by the runtime, so you don't have to worry about destructing them. Jon Skeet compared object references in Java to pieces of string that are attached to the balloon, which is the object. Same analogy applies to C# object references. They simply point to a location of the heap that contains the object. Continuing down the balloon analogy, it would seem logical that once the balloon has no strings attached to it, it can be destroyed. In fact this is exactly how reference counted objects work in non-managed languages. Except this approach doesn't work for circular references very well. Imagine two balloons that are attached together by a string but neither balloon has a string to anything else. Under simple ref counting rules, they both continue to exist, even though the whole balloon group is "orphaned".

Generated abstractive summary:
To summarize the answer: It's not necessary to set fields to null, but it's recommended to dispose of unmanaged resources, unsubscribe from events, and set fields holding delegates or expressions to null when no longer needed to improve garbage collection and memory management.

Extractive summary:
Normally, there's no need to set fields to null. <li>Unsubscribe from events if you no longer need them. <li>Set any field holding a delegate or an expression to null if it's no longer needed.

Ground truth:
From experience I'd also advise you to do the following: <li>Unsubscribe from events if you no longer need them. <li>Set any field holding a delegate or an expression to null if it's no longer needed. A good place to do this is in Dispose(), but sooner is usually better. Setting fields referencing other objects to null and clearing collections on disposal can really help the GC figure out what objects it can remove from memory.

To dispose of objects and set them to null, call the Dispose method if the class implements IDisposable. However, setting the reference to null does not guarantee the object is eligible for collection, as the JIT compiler can recognize when object references are no longer used.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Some might claim that calling <code>Dispose</code> on <code>DataSet</code>, for example, is pointless because they disassembled it and saw that it did not do anything meaningful. Let me illustrate my point with the following code. BIGBLOCK So when do you think the object referenced by <code>a</code> is eligible for collection? The correct answer is that it is eligible for collection sometime <strong>during</strong> the call to <code>DoSomething</code>. It is eligible <strong>before</strong> the reference is set to <code>null</code> and perhaps even before the call to <code>DoSomething</code> completes.

Extractive summary:
Well in general index is a <code>B-tree</code>. There are two types of indexes: clustered and nonclustered. Indexes are used to increase the speed of search.

Ground truth:
Well in general index is a <code>B-tree</code>. There are two types of indexes: clustered and nonclustered. Clustered index creates a physical order of rows (it can be only one and in most cases it is also a primary key - if you create primary key on table you create clustered index on this table also). Nonclustered index is also a binary tree but it doesn't create a physical order of rows. Indexes are used to increase the speed of search.

Question: Do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null?
Answer: When an object implements `IDisposable`, call `Dispose` (or `Close` if it calls `Dispose` internally). The GC will automatically collect unused objects; however, setting objects to `null` after use can help the GC if you've retrieved and stored multiple objects in a collection.

Extractive summary:
When an object implements <code>IDisposable</code> you should call <code>Dispose</code> (or <code>Close</code>, in some cases, that will call Dispose for you).

Ground truth:
You normally do not have to set objects to <code>null</code>, because the GC will know that an object will not be used anymore. There is one exception when I set objects to <code>null</code>. BIGBLOCK

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

Singletons with mutable state can lead to problems, including namespace conflicts and exposing state in an unwarranted fashion. They can also cause issues with thread-safety and synchronization, making them difficult to work with and test. A good rule of thumb is to use singletons only when a write-once, read-only instance of an object is necessary, and to ensure that the object's properties and members follow the same rule.

Extractive summary:
When it comes to Singletons A write-one read-only instance of an object. That same rule should cascade to the object's properties/members as well.

Ground truth:

Oddly enough, <code>new Array(size)</code> is almost 2x faster than <code>[]</code> in Chrome, and about the same in FF and IE (measured by creating and filling an array). It only matters if you know the approximate size of the array. If you add more items than the length you've given, the performance boost is lost.

A "const" at the end of a function declaration makes the function a "const function," meaning it cannot modify class variables, but can still read them. The "const" keyword can be loosened by marking specific variables as "mutable."

Extractive summary:
It is possible to loosen the "const function" restriction of not allowing the function to write to any variable of a class. To allow some of the variables to be writable even when the function is marked as a "const function", these class variables are marked with the keyword <code>mutable</code>.

The error "type or namespace name could not be found" in .NET can be caused by .NET framework version incompatibility between two projects. This can occur when a project targets an older framework version than the project it references. To resolve the issue, either upgrade the framework target of the referencing project or downgrade the target of the referenced assembly.

Extractive summary:
This can be the result of a .Net framework version incompatibility between two projects. <li>an older framework version targeting a newer framework version

Ground truth:
This can be the result of a .Net framework version incompatibility between two projects. It can happen in two ways: <li>a client profile project referencing a full framework project; or <li>an older framework version targeting a newer framework version The solution in this case is to either upgrade the framework target of the application (Project A), or downgrade the target of referenced assembly (Project B). Note that you can also get this error when you create a new project in VS2012 or VS2013 (which uses .Net 4.5 as the default framework) and: <li>the referencing project(s) use .Net 4.0 (this is common when you have migrated from VS2010 to VS2012 or VS2013 and you then add a new project) <li>the referenced projects use a greater version i.e.

Question: 'console' is undefined error for Internet Explorer
Answer: Try An undefined variable cannot be referred directly. However, all global variables are attributes of the same name of the global context (<code>window</code> in case of browsers), and accessing an undefined attribute is fine. Or use <code>if (typeof console === 'undefined') console = ...</code> if you want to avoid the magic variable <code>window</code>, see @Tim Down's answer.

Summary: To resolve the 'console' is undefined error in Internet Explorer, refer to the global context (window) or use a conditional statement to define console if it's undefined.

There is no standard iPad browser width and height. Apple's mobile WebKit scales pages to fit the screen, but designing a page with a width and height of 768x768 can minimize zooming.

Extractive summary:

Ground truth:
That said, you can design your page to minimize the amount of zooming necessary. Your best bet is to make the width and height the same as the lower resolution of the iPad, since you don't know which way it's oriented; in other words, you would make your page 768x768, so that it will fit well on the iPad's screen whether it's oriented to be 1024x768 or 768x1024. To accomplish this, you'll likely want to divide your controls among a number of web pages. On the other hand, it's not the most worthwhile pursuit. Make boxes with relevant grouped data that can be easily double-tapped to focus on, and keep related controls close to each other. iPad users will most likely appreciate a page that facilitates the familiar zoom-and-pan navigation they're accustomed to more than they will a page that has fewer controls so that they don't have to.

Generated abstractive summary:
The error in the <code>OBD2nerForm</code> initializer is likely due to a type mismatch in a generated form component, possibly caused by a bug in the NetBeans form generator. To diagnose the issue, try: 

- Upgrading to a newer version of NetBeans
- Searching for similar problems and bugs in the "bugs fixed" pages
- Cutting out parts of the form design to isolate the problem
- Running the application under a debugger to identify the specific component causing the issue
- Looking at the instance variables of the objects to determine the root cause.

Extractive summary:
I'd do the following to try and diagnose this: which specific form component is causing the problem. My suspicion is that the root cause is a combination of something a bit unusual (or incorrect) with your form design, and bugs in the NetBeans form generator that is not coping with your form.

Ground truth:
I'm surmising that the <code>OBD2nerForm</code> code you posted is a static initializer block and that it is all generated. Based on that and on the stack trace, it seems likely that generated code is tripping up because it has found some component of your form that doesn't have the type that it is expecting.

To resolve the "Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1" issue on an external JAR, remove all libraries except "Android X.Y" from the Java Build Path, clean the project, and check for duplicate JAR files or package name conflicts.

Go to Project __________________________________________ÃÂ» Properties __________________________________________ÃÂ» Java Build Path __________________________________________ÃÂ» Libraries and remove all except the "Android X.Y" (in my case Android 1.5). click OK. Go to Project __________________________________________ÃÂ» Clean __________________________________________ÃÂ» Clean projects selected below __________________________________________ÃÂ» select your project and click OK. That should work. It is also possible that you have a JAR file located somewhere in your project folders (I had copied the Admob JAR file into my src folder) and THEN added it as a Java Path Library. Another possible reason could be package name conflicts. In other ways this may be occurred if you accidentally or knowingly edit/ add any thing in the class path file manually .In certain cases we may add android.jar path manually to classpath file for generating java doc.On removing the that after javadoc generated code will works fine.Please check this too if any one still occurs.

Generated abstractive summary:
To read a text file and print all strings in C, use one of the following approaches: 

1.  Use `fgets()` to read the file in a loop and print the buffer content.
2.  Use `fread()` or `fgetc()` to process the file in fixed-size chunks or a single character at a time.
3.  If processing the file over whitespace-delimited strings, use `fgets()` or `fread()` and `strtok()` to split the buffer at whitespace.
4.  If using `scanf()`, limit the string length with a precision field in the format specifier.

Extractive summary:
These would process the file in fixed-size chunks or a single character at a time. If you must process the file over white-space delimited strings, then use either <code>fgets</code> or <code>fread</code> to read the file, and something like <code>strtok</code> to split the buffer at whitespace.

Ground truth:

Generated abstractive summary:
GET and POST are two different HTTP request types. GET retrieves data from a resource, while POST submits data to be processed, potentially creating or updating resources. GET should not be used for actions with side effects, as it may be used by robots or crawlers, and sensitive data should be submitted using POST instead.

Extractive summary:
<code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> are two different types of HTTP requests. GET requests a representation of the specified resource. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data.

Ground truth:
GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Finally, an important consideration when using <code>GET</code> for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a <code>GET</code> request.

The difference between POST and GET is analogous to learning the rules of the road before driving a car, as both are related to the underlying HTTP protocol. GET and POST are not directly related to programming languages like PHP/AJAX/jQuery, but rather are used in conjunction with them for communication.

Extractive summary:

Generated abstractive summary:
POST and GET are two HTTP request methods with different purposes: GET retrieves data, is idempotent, and has limited data capacity, while POST changes server state, carries more data, and is expected to have side-effects.

Extractive summary:
POST and GET are two HTTP request methods. POST is intended for changing the server state.

Ground truth:
POST and GET are two HTTP request methods. GET is usually intended to retrieve some data, and is expected to be idempotent (repeating the query does not have any side-effects) and can only send limited amounts of parameter data to the server. GET requests are often cached by default by some browsers if you are not careful. POST is intended for changing the server state.

Summary: POST and GET requests differ in their purpose: POST is for sending data to a server, while GET is for retrieving data from a server.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
With POST you can also do multipart mime encoding which means you can attach files as  well. Also if you are using post variables across navigation of pages, the user will get a warning asking if they want to resubmit the post parameter. Typically they look the same in an HTTP request, but you should just stick to POST if you need to "POST" something TO a server and "GET" if you need to GET something FROM a server as that's the way they were intended.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
To find missing numbers in a sequence of 1 to 100, use a set to remove numbers in O(N) time, then print the remaining numbers in O(N) time. However, by using a custom data structure (hash set and doubly linked list), the missing numbers can be printed in O(k) time.

Extractive summary:
As the question is stated, there are 100 numbers in the bag.

Ground truth:
No matter how big k is, the problem can be solved in constant time because you can use a set and remove numbers from the set in at most 100 - k iterations of a loop. If we generalise the solution to the numbers from 1 to N, nothing changes except N is not a constant, so we are in O(N - k) = O(N) time. It seems to me that the interviewer was asking you how to <em>print out</em> the contents of the final set in O(k) time rather than O(N) time. However, if you change the way the set is implemented you can print out the numbers in k iterations. This is done by putting the numbers into an object to be stored in both a hash set and a doubly linked list. When you remove an object from the hash set, you also remove it from the list.

In the MVVM pattern, the Model-View-ViewModel decouples the Model and View from the Controller, handling communication between them to make controllers cleaner and more reusable.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
From what I can tell, the MVVM maps to the MV of MVC - meaning that in a traditional MVC pattern the V does not communicate directly with the M. In the second version of MVC, there is a direct link between M and V. MVVM appears to take all tasks related to M and V communication, and couple it to decouple it from the C. In effect, there's still the larger scope application workflow (or implementation of the use scenarios) that are not fully accounted for in MVVM. By removing these lower level aspects from the controllers, they are cleaner and makes it easier to modify the application's use scenario and business logic, also making controllers more reusable.

==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
MVC and MVVM are not mutually exclusive patterns, and both are used in various forms of development. In ASP.Net, MVC is a server-side pattern for separating concerns, while MVVM is used for client-side two-way data binding. In Silverlight and WPF, MVVM is a more comprehensive pattern that can replace MVC, but it doesn't eliminate the need for controllers. Controllers handle processing logic, decide what data to display, and provide commands to view models. The MVVM pattern is beneficial for removing code from XAML code-behind, making XAML editing independent.

Extractive summary:
MVC/MVVM is not an either/or choice. The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development. MVC on the other hand is a way of separating concerns on the server-side. For Silverlight and WPF, the MVVM pattern is more encompassing and can appear to act as a replacement for MVC (or other patterns of organising software into separate responsibilities). The ViewModel does not necessarily replace the need for separate Controllers. Controllers provide the logic that controls what data is seen and where.

Ground truth:
MVC/MVVM is not an either/or choice. The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development. For ASP.Net, MVVM is used to two-way bind data within views.

Answer: An analogy is used to explain the concept: a pilot is an abstract class, a C-141 pilot is a concrete class, and a safety officer is an interface, which can be implemented by different classes (in this case, the pilot class).

Extractive summary:
<li>C-141 Pilot:  concrete class

Ground truth:

Generated abstractive summary:
The problem involves finding missing numbers in a sequence from 1 to 100. Solutions based on sum calculations are not practical for large inputs due to space complexity. A more efficient approach uses a simple recursive algorithm with a time complexity of O(kn log n) and space complexity of O(k + log n), making it more suitable for large inputs.

Extractive summary:
If this time and space is satisfactory, you can use a simple recursivealgorithm.

Ground truth:
The problem with solutions based on sums of numbers is they don't take into account the cost of storing and working with numbers with large exponents... in practice, for it to work for very large n, a big numbers library would be used. In Haskell syntax... BIGBLOCK Storage used: <code>O(k)</code> for list, <code>O(log(n))</code> for stack: <code>O(k + log(n))</code>This algorithm is more intuitive, has the same time complexity, and uses less space.

For the given question and answer, the concise summary is:

The interviewer's original question can be solved efficiently by using a set to store sent message identifiers and removing them as replies arrive. This approach allows for real-time identification of missing elements with an average time complexity of O(log k+1) after the last reply.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Depending on the problem and the requirements surrounding it, the obvious set-based solution might be the right thing and the generate-a-list-and-pick-through-it-afterward approach might not. This certainly isn't the fastest approach for batch processing pre-generated bags of numbers because the whole thing runs <code>O((log 1 + log 2 + ... + log n) + (log n + log n-1 + ... + log k))</code>. But it does work for any value of <code>k</code> (even if it's not known ahead of time) and in the example above it was applied in a way that minimizes the most critical interval.

You can't directly add a custom title, image, or description to a Facebook share link from a Flash app. However, there are workarounds: 

- Calculate the values on the server and send them in the page metadata.

- Send the calculation results in the query string to your site, which is less likely to hit URL size restrictions.

You can't, it just doesn't support it. Options are: <li><strong>calculate on the page:</strong> When serving the page you need to do those same calculations on the server and send the title, etc on the page metadata. <li><strong>send metadata in the query string to your site</strong>: If you really must keep the calculation off the server, an alternative trick would be to explicitly set the metadata in the URL the users click to get to your site from Facebook. <li><strong>send the calculation results in the query string to your site:</strong> if those calculations just give you a couple numbers that are used in the metadata, you could include just that in the query string of the URL the users click back to your site.

Answer: 
Summary: ECMAScript 5th Edition introduces the `Object.keys()` method to list object properties, supported in modern browsers, with a compatible implementation available for older browsers.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
As Sam Dutton answered, a new method for this very purpose has been introduced in ECMAScript 5th Edition. <code>Object.keys()</code> will do what you want and is supported in Firefox 4, Chrome 6, Safari 5 and IE 9. However, some of the implementations out there aren't fully compatible with Internet Explorer. It also doesn't account for the famous DontEnum bug in Internet Explorer where non-enumerable properties on the prototype chain cause locally declared properties with the same name to inherit their DontEnum attribute.

Python lambdas are useful for prototyping but have several drawbacks, including being harder to read, reuse, and debug compared to named closures. They also promote a less flexible functional-programming style and can clutter the language. The author prefers to avoid using lambdas in favor of more explicit and reusable code.

Extractive summary:

Reasons to use def main(): 

* Mimics the behavior of other languages (C and Java) 
* Keeps code organized, clean, and easier to read 
* Allows for module import without side effects 
* Enables unit testing and interactive shell testing 
* Keeps variables local, preventing global scope issues.

Extractive summary:
<li>Code will be <em>cleaner</em>, easier to read, and better organized.

Ground truth:
Reasons to have that <code>if</code> statement calling <code>main()</code> (in no particular order): <li>Other languages (like C and Java) have a <code>main()</code> function that is called when the program is executed. Using this <code>if</code>, we can make Python behave like them, which feels more familiar for many people. <li>Code will be <em>cleaner</em>, easier to read, and better organized. (yeah, I know this is subjective) <li>It will be possible to <code>import</code> that python code as a module without nasty side-effects. <li>This means it will be possible to run tests against that code. <li>This means we can import that code into an interactive python shell and test/debug/run it. <li>Variables inside <code>def main</code> are <strong>local</strong>, while those outside it are <strong>global</strong>. But, you are <strong>not required</strong> to write a <code>main()</code> function and call it inside an <code>if</code> statement.

Here's a concise summary of the provided answer:

To create a generic array in Java, use the `Class` object to represent the array type, and then use the `newInstance` method to create an array of the specified type. This can be achieved by passing a class literal (e.g., `String[].class`) to the `GenSet` constructor, which uses reflection to create an array of the correct type.

Extractive summary:
Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): So, <code>String.class</code> acts as a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>. So, whenever you call the constructor for <code>GenSet</code>, you pass in a class literal for the first argument representing an array of the <code>GenSet</code> instance's declared type (e.g.

Ground truth:
Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with <code>.class</code>. This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. Note that you won't be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can't be used for type variables. Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument. Calling the method <code>getComponentType</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the component type of the array represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called (e.g. Calling <code>String[].class.getComponentType()</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>, but its type is <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, not <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>, which is why you can't do something like the following.

Question: Hibernate cannot simultaneously fetch multiple bags
Answer: To fetch multiple bags in Hibernate, annotate the collection fields with `BIGBLOCK` and remove the `fetchType` attribute from the `@OneToMany` annotation, or consider using a `Set` instead of `List`.

Extractive summary:
BIGBLOCK Remember to remove the <code>fetchType</code> attribute from the <code>@*ToMany</code> annotation.

Ground truth:
I think a newer version of hibernate (supporting JPA 2.0) should handle this. But otherwise you can work it around by annotating the collection fields with: BIGBLOCK

Question: End of File (EOF) in C
Answer: EOF is typically represented as -1, which is also the value returned on error in POSIX system calls. A boolean operation (like !=) returns 1 for true and 0 for false, so getchar() != EOF evaluates to 0 when getchar() returns EOF, indicating an error. To emulate EOF when reading from stdin, press Ctrl+D.

Extractive summary:
<li>any boolean operation (including !=) returns 1 in case it's TRUE, and 0 in case it's FALSE, so <code>getchar() != EOF</code> is <code>0</code> when it's FALSE, meaning <code>getchar()</code> returned <code>EOF</code>. <li>in order to emulate <code>EOF</code> when reading from <code>stdin</code> press Ctrl+D

Ground truth:
<li>Why <code>EOF</code> is -1: usually -1 in POSIX system calls is returned on error, so i guess the idea is "EOF is kind of error" <li>any boolean operation (including !=) returns 1 in case it's TRUE, and 0 in case it's FALSE, so <code>getchar() != EOF</code> is <code>0</code> when it's FALSE, meaning <code>getchar()</code> returned <code>EOF</code>. <li>in order to emulate <code>EOF</code> when reading from <code>stdin</code> press Ctrl+D

Generated abstractive summary:
EOF in C indicates "end of file" and has a value of -1, different from any character returned by getchar().

Extractive summary:
EOF indicates "end of file".

Ground truth:
A newline (which is what happens when you press enter) isn't the end of a <em>file</em>, it's the end of a <em>line</em>, so a newline doesn't terminate this loop. The value of EOF is -1 because it has to be different from any return value from <code>getchar</code> that is an actual character. If you're typing at the terminal and you want to provoke an end-of-file, use CTRL-D (unix-style systems) or CTRL-Z (Windows).

Answer: Many years ago, to provide an age calculator gimmick on my website, I...
==================================================
Generated abstractive summary:
EOF in C is defined as -1, which cannot be mistaken for an actual byte read by getchar(). It is used to indicate the end of a file, similar to how control-Z (Windows) or control-D (Unix) signal the end of input.

Extractive summary:
The call to <code>getchar()</code> returns EOF when you reach the "end of file". On Unix systems, this is control-D.

Ground truth:
EOF is -1 because that's how it's defined. They make it equal to -1 because it has to be something that can't be mistaken for an actual byte read by <code>getchar()</code>. The <code>!=</code> operator means "not equal". 0 stands for false, and anything else stands for true. Of course, you can always type more, so you need an explicit way to say "I'm done". On Windows systems, this is control-Z. On Unix systems, this is control-D. Reading until EOF means that you read everything, until the user says "I'm done", and then you can't read any more. Reading until '\n' means that you read a line of input. Reading until '\0' is a bad idea if you expect the user to type the input, because it is either hard or impossible to produce this byte with a keyboard at the command prompt :)

Answer: The visibility of a property or method can be defined as public (accessible everywhere), protected (accessible within the class and inherited classes), or private (accessible only within the class itself).

Extractive summary:
The visibility of a property or method can be defined by prefixing the declaration with the keywords public, protected or private. Class members declared public can be accessed everywhere. Members declared protected can be accessed only within the class itself and by inherited and parent classes. Members declared as private may only be accessed by the class that defines the member.

The type initializer for 'MyClass' threw an exception, indicating the static constructor or initialization of static members in 'MyClass' is causing the issue.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<code>The type initializer for 'CSMessageUtility.CSDetails' threw an exception.</code> means that the static constructor on that class threw an Exception - so you need to look either in the static constructor of the CSDetails class, or in the initialisation of any static members of that class.

To force SSL/HTTPS using .htaccess and mod_rewrite, you can use the following solutions:

- PHP Solution: Use the `require()` function to include a centralized file containing the `forceHTTPS()` function, then run it on the pages you want to force HTTPS connections.
- .htaccess / mod_rewrite Solution: A start to a solution involves using .htaccess rules to force HTTPS connections.

Extractive summary:
PHP Solution HTACCESS / mod_rewrite Solution

Ground truth:
PHP Solution Borrowing directly from Gordon's very comprehensive answer, I note that your question mentions being page-specific in forcing HTTPS/SSL connections. HTACCESS / mod_rewrite Solution I have not implemented this kind of solution personally (I have tended to use the PHP solution, like the one above, for it's simplicity), but the following may be, at least, a good start.

To navigate from one page to another using JavaScript, you must use a form with a submit button, directing the action to a server-side program that verifies user credentials, and then emit an HTTP Location header for redirection.

Extractive summary:
The action attribute must point to a URL which will be handled by a program that checks the credentials. If you want to redirect afterwards, then the program needs to emit an HTTP Location header.

Ground truth:
You <strong>cannot</strong> sanely depend on <em>client side</em> JavaScript to determine if user credentials are correct. The browser (and all code that executes that) is under the control of the user, not you, so it is not trustworthy. Note that you need to check the credentials are OK (usually by storing a token, which isn't the actual password, in a cookie) before outputting any private page.

The error "unbound method f() must be called with fibo_ instance as first argument" occurs when trying to call a method on a class instead of an instance of that class. 

To fix this, you need to instantiate the class before calling the method.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
OK, first of all, you don't have to get a reference to the module into a different name; you already have a reference (from the <code>import</code>) and you can just use it. Second, you are getting a reference to the class rather than instantiating the class. The error usually means you are calling the method on the class rather than on an instance, which is exactly what was happening in this case because you hadn't instantiated the class.

Polymorphism refers to having multiple forms, and can be achieved through interface implementation, not just inheritance.

Extractive summary:
Polymorphism simply means "Many Forms". It does not REQUIRE inheritance to achieve...as interface implementation, which is not inheritance at all, serves polymorphic needs.

Ground truth:
Polymorphism simply means "Many Forms". So, since interfaces describe behavior, and method names describe behavior (to the programmer), it is not too far of a stretch to consider method overloading as a lesser form of polymorphism.

Android uses various units for measuring screen sizes and densities, including pixels (px), inches (in), millimeters (mm), points (pt), density-independent pixels (dp), and scale-independent pixels (sp). 

- Pixels (px) correspond to actual screen pixels.
- Inches (in) and millimeters (mm) are based on physical screen size.
- Points (pt) are 1/72 of an inch based on physical screen size.
- Density-independent pixels (dp) and scale-independent pixels (sp) are abstract units relative to a 160 dpi screen, but sp is also scaled by the user's font size preference.

Extremely long URLs are usually a

will not work in the most popular web

Be aware that the sitemaps protocol, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. While modern browsers will support longer URLs, search engines do not so the headline figure remains "under 2000 chars"

Question: What does "use strict" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?
Answer: 

"Use strict" is a feature in ECMAScript that places a program or function in a strict operating context, preventing certain actions and throwing exceptions. It catches common coding errors, prevents "unsafe" actions, and disables confusing or poorly thought-out features. It can be applied to the whole file or to a specific function, helping to make fewer errors by detecting potential breakages.

Extractive summary:
And:

Strict mode helps out in a couple ways: It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions. It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out. Also note you can apply "strict mode" to the whole file...

Ground truth:
Update for ES6 modules
Inside native ECMAScript modules (with <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> statements) and ES6 classes, strict mode is always enabled and cannot be disabled. Original answer
This article about Javascript Strict Mode might interest you: John Resig - ECMAScript 5 Strict Mode, JSON, and More
To quote some interesting parts:

Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. And:

Strict mode helps out in a couple ways: It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions. It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively "unsafe" actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object). It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out. So, I suppose it's a bit like the <code>"use strict"</code> you can use in Perl <em>(hence the name?)</em>: it helps you make fewer errors, by detecting more things that could lead to breakages. Strict mode is now supported by all major browsers.

'git pull' automatically merges fetched commits into the current branch, while 'git fetch' stores fetched commits in the local repository without merging, requiring a separate 'git merge' step.

Extractive summary:
<code>git pull</code> tries to automatically merge after fetching commits. <code>git fetch</code> gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in the current branch and <strong>stores them in your local repository</strong>. To integrate the commits into your current branch, you must use <code>git merge</code> afterwards.

Ground truth:
<code>git pull</code> tries to automatically merge after fetching commits. <em>It is context sensitive</em>, so all pulled commits will be merged into your currently active branch. <code>git pull</code> automatically merges the commits <strong>without letting you review them first</strong>. <code>git fetch</code> gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in the current branch and <strong>stores them in your local repository</strong>.

The "use strict" directive in JavaScript is a feature of ECMAScript 5 that enforces stricter syntax and error handling, preventing certain types of coding errors. It can be added to a JavaScript file or function and is supported by current browsers, but may cause issues if code is not compliant.

Here is a concise summary of the provided answer:

The main difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch' is that 'git fetch' updates the local copy of the remote repository, while 'git pull' updates the local working copy by merging the changes from the remote repository.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
It is important to contrast the design philosophy of git with the philosophy of a more traditional source control tool like SVN.
Subversion was designed and built with a client/server model. Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the "server" don't need to be online at the same time. In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. Normally <strong><code>git pull</code></strong> does this by doing a <strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy. The take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least <strong>three copies</strong> of a project on your workstation.

Screen size, density, and orientation are key concepts in Android development. 

Screen size is the actual physical size, grouped into four categories: small, normal, large, and extra-large. 
Screen density is the number of pixels per physical area, grouped into six categories: low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high, and extra-extra-extra-high. 
Resolution is the total number of physical pixels, but applications should focus on screen size and density instead.
Density-independent pixels (dp) are virtual pixels used for UI layout, which are scaled based on the actual screen density.

Extractive summary:
A virtual
pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express

Question: What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?
Summary: 'git fetch' retrieves changes from a remote branch without modifying the local branch, allowing you to inspect the changes before pulling them with 'git pull'.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
One use case of <code>git fetch</code> is that the following will tell you any changes in the remote branch since your last pull... so you can check before doing an actual pull, which could change files in your current branch and working copy.

Here's a concise summary of the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch':

`git fetch` updates the local repository's knowledge of the remote repository's state, while `git pull` updates the local repository's state by merging the changes from the remote repository.

Extractive summary:
So the difference will be:

Ground truth:
It cost me a little bit to understand what was the difference, but this is a simple explanation. <code>master</code> in your localhost is a branch. When you clone a repository you fetch the entire repository to you local host. This means that at that time you have an origin/master pointer to <code>HEAD</code> and master pointing to the same <code>HEAD</code>. But the origin/master pointer is still pointing to what it was when you cloned. If you do a <code>git fetch</code> it will just fetch all the changes in the remote repository (GitHub) and move the origin/master pointer to <code>HEAD</code>. If you do a <code>git pull</code>, it will do basically fetch (as explained previously) and merge any new changes to your master branch and move the pointer to <code>HEAD</code>.

"use strict" in JavaScript enforces stricter syntax rules, throwing exceptions for certain behaviors that are allowed in loose JavaScript. It's recommended to apply it in greenfield projects with comprehensive testing and a configured linter, but adding it to existing code can lead to unexpected errors.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
A word of caution, all you hard-charging programmers:  applying <code>"use strict"</code> to existing code can be hazardous! This thing is not some feel-good, happy-face sticker that you can slap on the code to make it 'better'. With the <code>"use strict"</code> pragma, the browser will suddenly THROW exceptions in random places that it never threw before just because at that spot you are doing something that default/loose JavaScript happily allows but strict JavaScript abhors! You may have strictness violations hiding in seldom used calls in your code that will only throw an exception when they do eventually get run - say, in the production environment that your paying customers use! If you are going to take the plunge, it is a good idea to apply <code>"use strict"</code> alongside comprehensive unit tests and a strictly configured JSHint build task that will give you some confidence that there is no dark corner of your module that will blow up horribly just because you've turned on Strict Mode. Or, hey, here's another option:  just don't add <code>"use strict"</code> to any of your legacy code, it's probably safer that way, honestly. <strong>DEFINITELY DO NOT</strong> add <code>"use strict"</code> to any modules you do not own or maintain, like third party modules. The best time to go strict is when your project is greenfield and you are starting from scratch.

Ground truth:
The JavaScript strict mode is a feature in ECMAScript 5. In this mode, errors are thrown up when certain coding practices that could end up being potential bugs are detected (which is the reasoning behind the strict mode). Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code. If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break. Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically. So in strict
mode, implied global variables are no longer created. In strict mode, attempting to change a
read-only property will throw an exception. So in
strict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error.

Screen size, density, orientation, and resolution are key concepts in Android development. 

Screen size refers to the actual physical size of the screen, grouped into four categories: small, normal, large, and extra-large. 
Screen density refers to the number of pixels within a physical area, grouped into four categories: low, medium, high, and extra-high. 
Orientation is either landscape or portrait, which can change at runtime. 
Resolution is the total number of physical pixels on a screen.

Density-independent pixels (dp) are virtual pixels used for defining UI layout, scaling to the actual screen density at runtime.

`git pull` and `git fetch` are two Git commands that retrieve data from a remote repository, but they differ in their purpose and outcome. 

- `git fetch` downloads the latest data from the remote repository, but does not merge it with the local branch. It updates local references to the remote branch.
- `git pull` combines `git fetch` and `git merge` to update the local branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.

It is very important to note that <code>git pull</code> will <strong>automatically merge whether you like it or not</strong>. This could, of course, result in merge conflicts. Unless you really, really know what you are doing, I would advise against that. This is a potentially dangerous mode of operation. Do not use this option unless you have read git-rebase(1)
  carefully.

Question: What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?
Answer: 
Definitions of px, dpi, dp, and sp are as follows:

- px (pixels) or dots: represent a physical screen pixel.
- dpi (dots per inch): measures screen density.
- dp (density-independent pixels): equivalent to 1px on medium-density screens, scaled for other densities.
- sp (scale-independent pixels): scaled with the Large Text option in Accessibility settings, equivalent to dp on standard settings.

Use sp for text size and dp for other elements.

Extractive summary:
Definitions
<strong>px</strong> or dot is a <em>pixel</em> on the physical screen. <strong>sp</strong> or <strong>sip</strong> is a <em>scale-independant pixel</em>. They are scaled when the <em>Large Text</em> option is turned on in Settings &gt; What to use?

Use <strong>sp</strong> for Text size.

Ground truth:
Definitions
<strong>px</strong> or dot is a <em>pixel</em> on the physical screen. <strong>dpi</strong> are pixels per inch on the physical screen and represent the density of the display. Android gives alias names to several densities <strong>dip</strong> or <strong>dp</strong> are <em>density-indenpendant pixels</em>, i.e. they correspond to more or less pixels depending on the physical density.

I strongly recommend every developer to start using strict mode now. There are enough browsers supporting it that strict mode will legitimately help save us from errors we didn’t even know were in your code.

The difference between px, dip, dp, and sp in Android is that they represent various units of measurement for screen density and size. 

- **px** (Pixels) corresponds to actual screen pixels, but is not recommended due to varying pixel density across devices.
- **dp** (Density-independent Pixels) is scaled based on screen density, providing consistent UI element sizes across devices.
- **sp** (Scale-independent Pixels) is like dp, but also scales with the user's font size preference.
- **pt** (Points) is 1/72 of an inch based on physical screen size.
- **mm** (Millimeters) and **in** (Inches) are based on physical screen size.

Extractive summary:
A dimension is specified
with a number followed by a unit of measure. <strong>sp</strong>
Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. <strong>pt</strong>
Points - 1/72 of an inch based on the physical size of the screen. <strong>mm</strong>
Millimeters - Based on the physical size of the screen. <strong>in</strong>
Inches - Based on the physical size of the screen.

<strong>Note:</strong>

Ground truth:
These are dimension values defined in XML. A dimension is specified
with a number followed by a unit of measure. The following units of measure are supported by Android:
<strong>dp</strong>
Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the
physical density of the screen. Using dp
units (instead of px units) is a simple solution to making the view
dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen
densities. In other words, it provides consistency for the real-world
sizes of your UI elements across different devices. <strong>sp</strong>
Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended that you use
this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for
both the screen density and the user's preference. This unit of
measure is not recommended because the actual representation can vary
across devices; each device may have a different number of pixels per
inch and may have more or fewer total pixels available on the screen. A dimension is a simple resource that is referenced using the value provided in the name attribute (not the name of the XML file).

The key differences between px, dip, dp, and sp are: px is equivalent to 1 pixel, while dip and dp are density-independent pixels that scale with screen density, and sp is a scaling-independent pixel that is used for font sizes.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Basically the only time where px applies is one px, and that's if you want exactly one pixel on the screen like in the case of a divider: 
On &gt;160 dpi, you may get 2-3 pixels, 
On &gt;120 dpi, it rounds to 0.

To summarize the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch':

Git fetch downloads changes made to the origin/main branch that are not present in your local branch, allowing you to monitor and modify your local files before merging. Git pull updates your local branch with the origin/main branch, effectively combining a fetch and merge, but may cause conflicts.

Extractive summary:
This will update your local branch with the origin/main branch i.e. actually what it does is a combination of Git Fetch and Git merge one after another.

<em>(Keeping in mind that pictures speak louder than words!, I have provided pictorial representation)</em>
Let's take an example that you are working on a project with your team members. So there will be one main Branch of the project and all the contributors must fork it to their own local repository and then work on this local branch to modify/Add modules then push back to the main branch. To avoid such issues and to work parallel with the original progress of the project there are Two ways:

In simple terms, if you were about to hop onto a plane without any Internet connection… before departing you could just do <code>git fetch origin &lt;branch&gt;</code>. It would fetch all the changes into your computer, but keep it separate from your local development/workspace. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody <em>else</em> has
been working on. You can consider
<code>git fetch</code> the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download
the remote content, but not update your local repository's working state,
leaving your current work intact. <em>Any</em> <code>git fetch</code> that you do will update the pointer in the <code>/.git/refs/remotes</code> directory. It <strong>won't</strong> update anything in the <code>/.git/refs/heads</code> directory. <em>Any</em> <code>git pull</code> will first do the <code>git fetch</code> and update items in the <code>/.git/refs/remotes</code> directory.

Here's a concise summary of the given answer:

The "use strict" directive in JavaScript is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 5 that enables strict mode, which eliminates language deficits and features more stringent error checking and higher security. It can be used at the beginning of a script or a function and indicates that the following code is strict code. Strict mode has several restrictions and differences compared to normal mode, including:

* No implicit global variable declaration
* The "this" keyword has a value of undefined in functions
* No use of the "with" statement
* More stringent error checking and handling
* Restrictions on property deletion and object modification
* Restrictions on function parameter names and object literals
* Disallowance of octal literals
* Treatment of "eval" and "arguments" as keywords

Overall, using "use strict" can help prevent common programming mistakes and improve code quality.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would like to offer a somewhat more founded answer complementing the other answers. The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important): You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode. In strict mode all variables have to be declared: if you assign a value to an identifier that has not been declared as variable, function, function parameter, catch-clause parameter or property of the global <code>Object</code>, then you will get a <code>ReferenceError</code>. In strict mode the keyword <code>this</code> has the value <code>undefined</code> in functions that were invoked as functions (not as methods). In strict mode, when passing code to <code>eval()</code>, you cannot declare or define variables or functions in the scope of the caller (as you can do it in normal mode).

Summary: The difference between px, dp, and sp is as follows: 

- **dp (Density-independent pixel)**: a virtual pixel unit used for defining UI layout dimensions, equivalent to 1 physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen. It scales automatically based on screen density.
- **px**: a physical pixel unit, not recommended for layout files but can be used in specific cases, such as a one-pixel line.
- **sp (Scaled pixel)**: used for font sizes, allowing the font to change with the device's font size setting, but remaining static in the app if set in dp.

sp
Use sp for font sizes.

Ground truth:
A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure

The "use strict" directive in JavaScript is a mode that enables strict parsing and runtime checking of the code, helping developers catch errors and silent behavior issues earlier. It prevents certain bad practices such as:

- Global variable declarations
- Use of the "with" statement
- Duplicate property declarations in object literals

When enabled, "use strict" throws exceptions for these issues, making it easier to identify and fix errors.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
<em>My two cents:</em>
One of the goals of strict mode is to allow for faster debugging of issues. It helps the developers by throwing exception when certain wrong things occur that can cause silent &amp; strange behaviour of your webpage. The moment we use <code> use strict</code>, the code will throw out errors which helps developer to fix it in advance. Few important things which I have learned after using <code> use strict</code> :
<em><strong>Prevents Global Variable Declaration:</strong></em> When we implement <code>use strict</code> the code would throw error. They're also deprecated and removed from future JavaScript versions. <em><strong>Prevents Duplicates :</strong></em> When we have duplicate property, it throws an exception Duplicate data property in object literal not
allowed in strict mode

The key difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch' is that 'git pull' automatically merges the fetched data, while 'git fetch' requires a separate 'git merge' to update the local code.

Extractive summary:
If you run <code>git pull</code>, you do not need to merge the data to local. If you run <code>git fetch</code>, it means you must run <code>git merge</code> for getting the latest code to your local machine. Fetch itself won't make the code changes at your local.

Ground truth:
If you run <code>git pull</code>, you do not need to merge the data to local. If you run <code>git fetch</code>, it means you must run <code>git merge</code> for getting the latest code to your local machine. So in the Git Gui, when you do fetch, you have to merge the data. Fetch itself won't make the code changes at your local. You will see the changed code.

The difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch' lies in their individual functions: 'git fetch' downloads changes from the remote repository, while 'git merge' applies those changes to the local branch. 'git pull' combines 'fetch' and 'merge' to update the local branch with the latest changes.

Extractive summary:
<strong>Git Fetch</strong>
You download changes to your local branch from origin through fetch. Fetch downloads these commits and adds them to the local repository. <strong>Git Merge</strong>
You can apply changes downloaded through fetch using the merge command. Merge will take the commits retrieved from fetch and try to add them to your local branch. Pull does a fetch and then a merge to add the downloaded commits into your local branch.

Ground truth:
<strong>Git Fetch</strong>
You download changes to your local branch from origin through fetch. <strong>Git Merge</strong>
You can apply changes downloaded through fetch using the merge command. <strong>Git Pull</strong>
Fetch and merge run together often enough that a command that combines the two, pull, was created.

The differences between px, dip, dp, and sp are:

- sp: scale-independent pixel (avoid using)
- dp (or dip): density-independent pixel
- dpi: dots per inch
- Android supports multiple screen resolutions, including ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, and xxxhdpi.
- A conversion formula is used to calculate pixels: pixel = dp * (density / 160)
- The formula can be used to design layouts for different screen densities.
- To check screen parameters, use `DisplayMetrics` and `getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getMetrics(metrics)`.

Extractive summary:
Android supports different screen resolutions

Ground truth:
We should avoid to use <strong>sp</strong>. We should use <strong>dp</strong> to support multiple screens. Android supports different screen resolutions We as software engineers should use this conversion formula:

pixel = dp * (density / 160) Using this 1.5 and 3 pixels knowledge, a software engineer can design layouts for different densities.

The main point is: The best open source game to learn from is Rogue, Hack, or Nethack, as it's a seminal influence behind the hack-and-slash dungeon-crawling genre.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
If part of the reason for open-source code is for code to be reused and recycled as it evolves, then I think influence and legacy would be two large factors in this decision. On this basis, I would probably vote Rogue / Hack / Nethack.

The HTTP 1.1 specification does not place an a priori limit on URL length, but servers should be able to handle URIs of any length and return a 414 status if they cannot handle a URL.

Extractive summary:
The HTTP protocol does not place
  any a priori limit on the length of
  a URI.

Ground truth:
The HTTP 1.1 specification says:

URIs in HTTP can be represented in
  absolute form or relative to some
  known base URI The two
  forms are differentiated by the fact
  that absolute URIs always begin
  with a scheme name followed by a
  colon. The HTTP protocol does not place
  any a priori limit on the length of
  a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
  the URI of any resource they    serve,
  and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
  unbounded length if they    provide
  GET-based forms that could generate
  such URIs.*</strong> A server    SHOULD return
  414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
  URI is longer    than the server can
  handle (see section 10.4.15). Note: Servers ought to be cautious about depending on URI
  lengths
        above 255 bytes, because some older client or proxy
        implementations might not properly support these lengths. As mentioned by @Brian, the HTTP clients (e.g. browsers) may have their own limits, and HTTP servers will have different limits.

The differences between px, dip, dp, and sp are:

- px: Not specified in the answer, but generally refers to pixels.
- dp: Density-independent pixels, used for layout bounds.
- sp: Scale-independent pixels, used for text size, but can break layouts if used carelessly.
- dpi: Density pixels, not directly mentioned in the answer, but implied to be related to device density.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Most Android developers miss this while developing apps, so I am adding these points. sp for text size, dp for layout bounds - standard. But <strong>sp for text size will break the layout if used carelessly</strong> in most of the devices. No standard app use sp for whole text</strong>
Use sp and dp for text size considering UX. Put sp for text where necessary, but make sure it won't break the layout when the user changes his settings. But now xxxhdpi phones are common so we have to include xxxhdpi assets at least for icons in the sidebar, toolbar, and bottom bar. It's better to move to vector images to have a uniform and better quality images for all screen sizes.

Here's a concise summary of the given answer:

The difference between px, dip, dp, and sp in Android is as follows:

- **px**: Screen pixel, the usual standard unit.
- **dp** (Density Independent Pixel): Varies based on screen density, equivalent to 1 pixel on a 160 dpi screen.
- **dip**: Same as dp, used in earlier Android versions and later replaced by dp.
- **sp** (Scale Independent Pixel): Scaled based on user's font size preference, used for font sizes.

The formula to convert dp to px is: `px = dp * (dpi / 160)`. The recommended design ratio for different screen densities is 3:4:6:8:12 for ldpi:mdpi:hdpi:xhdpi:xxhdpi. A DPI calculator in Java is provided to help with uniform UI design across devices.

Extractive summary:
<strong>dp:</strong> Density Independent Pixel, varies based on screen density. In 160 dpi screen, 1 dp = 1 pixel. Scale Independent Pixel, scaled based on user’s font size preference. <strong>px:</strong> our usual standard pixel which maps to the screen pixel.

Ground truth:
Screen Size</strong> in <code>Android</code> is grouped into categories <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>, <code>large</code>, <code>extra large</code>, <code>double-extra</code> and <code>triple-extra</code>. Screen density is the number of pixels within an area (like an inch) of the screen. Screen density is grouped as low, medium, high, and extra high. Resolution is the total number of pixels on the screen. <strong>dp:</strong> Density Independent Pixel, varies based on screen density. Except for font size, use dp always. Scale Independent Pixel, scaled based on user’s font size preference. Fonts should use sp. The scaling occurs based on bucket sizes of 120(ldpi), 160(mdpi), 240(hdpi), 320(xhdpi), 480(xxhdpi), and 640(xxxhdpi). The Google suggested ratio for designing is 3:4:6:8:12 for ldpi:mdpi:hdpi:xhdpi:xxhdpi

To sanity check a date in Java, a basic approach is to test the conversion from string to date using SimpleDateFormat.parse, but this is not enough due to its liberal behavior. A strict solution involves a combination of regex to match the date string format and a forced date conversion. This can be achieved with the standard library, or alternatively, by using the Joda Time library, which is better at being strict about invalid characters but does not currently support enforcing 4-digit years.

Ground truth:
<code>"use strict"</code> makes JavaScript code to run in <em>strict mode</em>, which basically means everything needs to be defined before use. The main reason for using strict mode is to avoid accidental global uses of undefined methods. Also in strict mode, things run faster, some warnings or silent warnings throw fatal errors, it's better to always use it to make a neater code. <code>"use strict"</code> is widely needed to be used in ECMA5, <strong>in ECMA6 it's part of JavaScript by default</strong>, so it doesn't need to be added if you're using ES6.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

The key differences between px, dp, and sp are:

- **px**: represents physical pixels on the screen
- **dp (density-independent pixels)**: a scaling unit that adapts to different screen densities (1dp = 1px on a 160dpi device)
- **sp (scaled pixels)**: a scaling unit that adapts to different screen sizes and densities, introduced by the SDP library.

The Android screen size guideline defines minimum required space for each screen size in dp, while the density guideline defines the four generalized densities (ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi) with a 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio.

Extractive summary:
Android defines a

It remained unclear to me how to design layouts capable to handle different screen sizes. Designing flexible UI in Android is not an easy thing (at the best). Many designers have problems designing Android app UI in photoshop or another pixel
based graphic design tools because of the density-independent unit, dp. Google also doesn’t give
a clear Android UI design guide for them, though they give a basic
formula for dp and pixel translation. This size unit scales with the screen size (this also mentioned in an answer here, about <code>SDP</code> library) Google has finally understood the usefulness of the iOS Storeboard UI concept, and here goes <code>ConstraintLayout</code> for Android world: Build a Responsive UI with ConstraintLayout

Git obtains the branch of the latest version from the remote to the local using two commands: git fetch: Git is going to get the latest version from remote to local,  but it do not automatically merge. git pull: Git is going to get the latest version from the remote and merge into the local. The command above is the equivalent to <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code>. In practice, <code>git fetch</code> maybe more secure because before the merge we can see the changes and decide whether to merge.

The code provided demonstrates how to use AES encryption in C# and JavaScript to achieve interoperability between the two languages. 

To achieve this, the code uses a custom AES implementation in a Windows Script Component (WSC) called slowAES, which is called from the C# code and the JavaScript code. 

The C# code encrypts and decrypts a string using the slowAES component, and the JavaScript code does the same using the ActiveXObject to instantiate the slowAES component. 

The key size used is 256 bits, and the mode is CBC. The code also includes a function to convert a byte array to a hexadecimal string. 

The provided code produces the same ciphertext in both C# and JavaScript for a given plaintext and passphrase, demonstrating the interoperability between the two languages.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I took your C# code and modified it slightly. The C# code I use, in its entirety, is: If I then run this code, the Javascript and C# produces the same cipher text for a plaintext of "watson?", using AES256, passphrase of 12345678901234567890123456789012, and an IV of 16 bytes of zero. It successfully decrypts in both cases. The source code that demonstrates AES interop between Javascript or VBScript and .NET is available. I extended the basic example given here to produce test apps in 3 languages: C#, Javascript and VBScript. You can easily verify that the ciphertext is the same for each of these test programs.

Here's a concise summary of the given answer:

`git pull` is equivalent to running `git fetch` followed by `git merge`, while `git fetch` only retrieves data from the remote repository without making any changes to local branches.

Extractive summary:
git pull == ( git fetch + git merge)
git fetch does not changes to local branches.

Ground truth:
git pull == ( git fetch + git merge)
git fetch does not changes to local branches. If you already have a local repository with a remote set up for the desired project, you can grab all branches and tags for the existing remote using git fetch . Fetch does not make any changes to local branches, so you will need to merge a remote branch with a paired local branch to incorporate newly fetch changes.

px, dp, and sp are units of measurement for screen sizes in Android development. 

- dp (density-independent pixels) is a relative unit that scales with screen resolution (1 dp = a certain number of pixels at 160 dpi).
- sp (scale-independent pixels) scales with both screen dpi and user font size preference.
- px (pixels) represents actual screen dots.

For more information, see the Android Developer Guide.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
1) <strong><code>dp: (density independent pixels)</code></strong> The number of pixels represented in one unit of dp will increase as the screen resolution increases (when you have more dots/pixels per inch). Conversely on devices with lower resolution, the number of pixels represented in on unit of dp will decrease. This is the equation: <code>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</code>

2) <strong><code>sp: (scale independent pixels)</code></strong>
This unit scales according to the screen dpi (similar to dp) as well as the user’s font size preference. 3) <strong><code>px: (pixels)</code></strong> 
Actual pixels or dots on the screen.

Screen size in Android is categorized into groups (ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, etc.) and density is measured in dots-per-inch (dpi). The differences between px, dp, and sp are:

- **PX (Pixels):** Absolute pixels, not recommended for dynamic sizing.
- **DP (Density Pixels / Density Independent Pixels):** Alternative to PX, recommended for dynamic sizing, automatically calculates pixel size based on a 160 pixel screen.
- **SP (Scale Independent Pixels):** Scaled based on user's font size preference, recommended for font sizes to grow/shrink dynamically based on screen sizes.

Ground truth:
Screen size</strong> in Android is grouped into categories <code>ldpi</code>, <code>mdpi</code>, <code>hdpi</code>, <code>xhdpi</code>, <code>xxhdpi</code> and <code>xxxhdpi</code>. Screen density</strong> is the amount of pixels within an area (like inch) of the screen.

Android Documentation says:

when specifying dimensions, always use either <code>dp</code> or <code>sp</code> units. A <code>dp</code> is
  a density-independent pixel that corresponds to the physical size of a
  pixel at 160 <code>dpi</code>. An <code>sp</code> is the same base unit, but is scaled by the
  user's preferred text size (it’s a scale-independent pixel), so you
  should use this measurement unit when defining text size

git pull and git fetch differ in their functionality. 

git fetch updates your local information about remote branches without merging or rebasing changes into your local branch. 

In contrast, git pull performs both a fetch and a merge or rebase of the remote changes into your local branch.

Extractive summary:
git fetch will work with the remote branch and update your information.

Ground truth:
One must keep in mind the nature of git. You have remotes and your local branches ( not necessarily the same ) . Usually when you checkout a remote a local copy is created that tracks the remote. In order to bring the changes to your local branch you have to merge/rebase the changes from the remote branch. git pull does exactly these two steps ( i.e. --rebase to rebase instead of merge ) Thus it really depends on the nature of your work environment and experience what to use.

Pixel density refers to the number of pixels per inch on a screen. It varies between devices, with high-density screens having more pixels per inch than low-density ones. To calculate pixel density, use the equation: Screen density = Screen width (or height) in pixels / Screen width (or height) in inches. Density-independent pixels (dp) are flexible units that scale uniformly on screens with different densities, ensuring consistent display of UI elements.

Extractive summary:

To recover SVN history on a file, use TortoiseSVN to repair the move operation by marking the old and new file names, right-clicking, and selecting "Repair Move". Alternatively, resurrect the old file, merge the new file's history, delete the new file, and then move the old file to the new name.

Extractive summary:
Right click this selection and chose "Repair Move".

Ground truth:
The SVN way to do this is actually to have SVN rename the file (<code>svn move</code> or using TortoiseSVN's "Rename"). However, if you absolutely <em>must</em> have some external tool to perform the rename operation, you can <strong><em>use TortoiseSVN to repair the move operation</em></strong>. The following will tell SVN that the new file is actually the renamed old one: If you already lost the history on a file where you miss it badly, you could resurrect the old file (you do this by <code>svn copy</code>ing an old revision's version into its old place), merge the new file's history into it, then delete the new file, and <code>svn move</code> the old file to the new file's name.

The table view must be updated with index paths that correspond to the data added to the datasource. 

Here's how to do it:

- Build the index paths for insertion by looping through the new data and adding each index path to an array.
- Add the new data to the datasource.
- Tell the table view to update at the inserted index paths by calling `insertRowsAtIndexPaths` with the array of index paths.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The code is close, but the table view needs to be updated with index paths in exact correspondence with what's added to the datasource. You want a weakSelf to avoid cycle where the block owner retains the block and the block (by using the block owner "self") retains the owner. There's no need for the weakSelf pattern here since the view controller is not retaining a copy of the dispatched block.

The key differences between px, dp, and sp are:

- **Pixels (px)**: Measure screen resolution, but not physical size, making them less useful for designing for Android devices.
- **Density Independent Pixels (dp or dip)**: Allow designers to create assets that appear as expected across different resolutions and device densities. 1 dp is equal to 1 pixel at the baseline density (160 dpi).
- **Scale Independent Pixels (sp)**: Preferred unit for font size, allowing for customization of font size on Android devices, ensuring a better experience for users with impaired eyesight.

Extractive summary:
Screen resolution is measured in terms of number of pixels on the screen. A density independent pixel (dp or dip) is equal to one pixel at the baseline density or 160 dpi (dots per inch). <strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size. For accessibility purposes, Android allows users to customize their device's font size. Users that have trouble reading text can increase their device's font size. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.

Ground truth:
The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as <strong>pixels (px)</strong>. A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important. <strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device. Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone. <strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size. With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.

Pixels (px) correspond to actual screen pixels, while dp (density-independent pixels) and sp (scale-independent pixels) are relative units based on screen density and user preferences. Use dp for layout dimensions and sp for font sizes to ensure Android UI compatibility.

Extractive summary:
<strong>Pixels(px)</strong> – corresponds to actual pixels on the screen.

Ground truth:
<strong>Pixels(px)</strong> – corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. <strong>Density-independent Pixels (dp or dip)</strong> – an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. <strong>Scale-independent Pixels(sp)</strong> – this is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user’s font size preference. Always use dp and sp only. It will make UI compatible for Android devices with different densities.

WCF Messaging Patterns: Synchronous, Asynchronous Send, and Asynchronous Request-Response. 

Three messaging patterns are available in WCF: synchronous request-response, asynchronous send (one-way service), and asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service). The choice of pattern depends on the application's needs. 

For returning a success response to the client when data is persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are suitable. Option 1 returns a 200 response on the same HTTP connection, blocking the client until the service completes its tasks. Option 3 uses a duplex service call with a one-way service, returning a 202 response and allowing the client to continue execution while awaiting a callback with the service response.

Extractive summary:
There are three messaging patterns mentioned here: Asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service) For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate.

Ground truth:
There are three messaging patterns mentioned here: All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate. Option 2
Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not. Option 3
Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. As Whisk mentioned, Juval Lowy has an article covering a lot this detail (and more!) One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown.

The @ symbol in C# should generally be avoided, except for specific cases such as:

- Dealing with external libraries from other languages that have classes or methods with the same name as C# keywords.
- Code generation, where prefixing with @ can simplify naming conventions.
- Verbatim string literals, which are more useful.

Extractive summary:
The @ symbol's other use (verbatim string literals) is @"much more useful".

Ground truth:
Indeed, it is almost always worth avoiding this. The main <strong>valid</strong> time it might be useful is when dealing with an external library (from another language) that has a class / etc that happens to be a C# keyword, but I'll admit I've <strong>never</strong> had this problem in reality. The @ symbol's other use (verbatim string literals) is @"much more useful".

It's just convenient for us to write <code>50dp</code>, <code>60dp</code> rather than <code>50/160 inch</code> or <code>60/160 inch</code>, because one <code>dp</code> is just <code>1/160 inch</code> whatever the screen size or resolution is. The only problem is that, the android dpi of some screens are not accurate. So the computation result of <code>dp</code> is fuzzy.

<strong>SDP</strong> - a scalable size unit - basically it is not a unit, but dimension resources for different screen size. Try the sdp library from Intuit.

Ground truth:
<strong>SDP</strong> - a scalable size unit - basically it is not a unit, but dimension resources for different screen size. Try the sdp library from Intuit. It's very handy to solve unit problems, and you can <em>quickly support multiple screens</em>. In most cases you still need to design a different layout for tablets.

Instead of requesting all GHC extensions, specify the used extensions using the LANGUAGE pragma mechanism. Parallel list comprehensions are not standard in Haskell 98, but can be simulated using the zip function. Extensions are not inherently bad, but some are not recommended unless you know what you're doing; those with support from two or more compilers are generally safe to use.

Extractive summary:
Instead of requesting <em>all</em> GHC extensions, specify which ones are used using the <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma mechanism: The problem is that parallel comprehensions are not defined in the Haskell 98 standard.

Ground truth:
Instead of requesting <em>all</em> GHC extensions, specify which ones are used using the <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma mechanism: Parallel iteration over the same list is allowed. The problem is that parallel comprehensions are not defined in the Haskell 98 standard. Extensions themselves are not bad -- much of the standard library uses extensions, of one sort or another.

When building a web spider, using recursion is not recommended due to the potential for infinite loops and the web's complex structure. Instead, use a queue-based iterative approach to handle links and avoid revisiting processed pages.

Ground truth:
Definitely not, you're going to run into problems very quickly because of the actual nature of the world wide web. The second you hit a site with a main navigation section, where each page links to each other page, you've entered an infinite loop. You're better off finding all links on the current page and adding those links (if they don't already exist) to a central queue, and proceeding iteratively through the queue processing every link as you come to it (remember to keep track of links that you've finished processing, or you'll add them to the end of the queue again)

Python decompression relative performance can be improved by using `numpy.savez_compressed` for a 2.3x speedup over PIL-based code.

According to the zstd benchmarks, when optimizing for decompression lz4 is a good choice. Just plugging this into pickle gives another 2.4x gain and is only 30% slower than uncompressed pickling. The load time was measured inside Python (3.7.3), using the minimum wall-clock time over 20 runs on my desktop.

To resolve CLion's inability to link with OpenCV for Windows, you may need to build OpenCV from source. This is because CLion's build toolchain (MinGW or Cygwin) is incompatible with the MSVC-built OpenCV binaries. To link OpenCV, you must specify it in your project's CMakeLists.txt file, and ensure that the OpenCV_DIR environment variable is set to the build folder beneath the OpenCV installation. Additionally, you may need to modify OpenCVConfig.cmake or FindOpenCV.cmake to point to the MSVC binaries, but this is not a solution due to compiler incompatibility.

Extractive summary:
The short answer is, <strong>you will probably need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</strong>. To make use of <em>OpenCV</em> in your build you must specify it in your project's <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> file. To link with OpenCV, CMake uses either <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> or <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> compatibility problems.

The short answer is, <strong>you will probably need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</strong>. But given the number and range of partially answered and unanswered questions here* and elsewhere on using JetBrains' CLion IDE with the OpenCV library, I think an overview is needed (my notes are from CLion 2016.3 and OpenCV 3.1, YMMV): This probably means <strong><em>you will need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</em></strong>. Hopefully this provides some general guidance on resolving <em>CLion / CMake / OpenCV</em>

Python decompression relative performance can be improved using Python-blosc, a very fast and easy-to-use library for compressing and decompressing arrays. It offers two compression modes: 'lz4' and 'zstd', with 'lz4' being faster but less compressible. The library provides functions for compressing and decompressing contiguous and non-contiguous arrays, including those over 2GB.

Extractive summary:
You can use Python-blosc
It is very fast and for small arrays (&lt;2GB) also quite easy to use. It does handle f-contiguous, c-contiguous and non-contiguous arrays and arrays &gt;2GB.

Ground truth:
You can use Python-blosc
It is very fast and for small arrays (&lt;2GB) also quite easy to use. On easily compressable data like your example, it is often faster to compress the data for IO operations. In the decompression step the array allocation is the most costly part. If your images are of similar shape you can avoid repeated memory allocation. It does handle f-contiguous, c-contiguous and non-contiguous arrays and arrays &gt;2GB.

Ground truth:
As mentioned by others, this is because the loader can't be found, not your executable file. You can fix it by changing the loader that your executable uses, see my thorough answer in this other question: Multiple glibc libraries on a single host

Generated abstractive summary:
Hash tables may require resizing as elements are added, which takes linear time, but can be done infrequently to maintain an average constant insertion time.

Extractive summary:
If you want to keep fast access, you need to resize the table from time to time as the number of element grows.

Ground truth:
For some uses of hash tables, it's impossible to create them of the "right" size in advance, because it is not known how many elements will need to be held simultaneously during the lifetime of the table. If you want to keep fast access, you need to resize the table from time to time as the number of element grows. These resizing operations can be made seldom enough that the amortized cost of insertion is still constant (by following a geometric progression for the size of the table, for instance doubling the size each time it is resized). In practice, this is not a problem unless you are building hard real-time applications.

"Strict mode in JavaScript aims to amend poor design decisions and un-intuitive syntax by creating an alternative interpretation of code while maintaining backward compatibility. It affects how the 'this' keyword behaves, resolving to 'undefined' in global functions, rather than the global object, as seen in non-strict mode."

Extractive summary:
Strict mode aims to amend some of these mistakes.

Ground truth:
JavaScript was designed and implemented hastily because of the browser wars and bad management. Strict mode aims to amend some of these mistakes. But fixing these mistakes without creating alternative interpretation breaks backward compatibility. So, <code>"use strict"</code> directive creates that alternative interpretation of the code while communicating it to the programmer. In strict mode <code>this</code> in a global function resolves to undefined, which is what we expect. Some mistakes can not be fixed even in strict mode because syntax should be valid for older browsers since they ignore <code>"strict mode"</code> directive.

Using instanceof and cast can be considered "evil" because it is an obscure and tricky way of doing something simple, and can lead to performance issues due to unnecessary reflection and method calls.

Extractive summary:
It is an obscure and tricky way of doing something very simple. Unnecessary use of reflection is evil. IMO, the "simple way" is better from both the readability and performance perspectives.

Ground truth:
Now, I was told that using this castOrNull function in that way is an evil thing do to. It is an obscure and tricky way of doing something very simple. Obscure and tricky code is hard to read, hard to maintain, a potential source of errors (when someone doesn't understand it) and <em>therefore</em> evil. Unnecessary use of reflection is evil.

PostgreSQL displays intervals in different formats depending on the operation performed. When an interval is a difference between two timestamps, it is displayed in a standard format with hours. However, calculations on intervals can lead to non-standard formats. To standardize these formats, PostgreSQL provides the `justify_hours` function. A reverse function, `unjustify_hours`, can be created to convert a date part of an interval to hours.

Extractive summary:
For such cases Postgres developers provided the appropriate function for the <em>format standardization</em>:

Ground truth:
When an interval is <strong>a difference between two timestamps</strong> <strong>Calculations on intervals</strong> are executed on date part and time part separately, so they may lead to strange formats. However they did not think that the reverse operation would be needful. In this answer I proposed a function to convert a date part of an interval to hours. Per the documentation:

According to the SQL standard all fields of an interval value must
  have the same sign, so a leading negative sign applies to all fields;
  for example the negative sign in the interval literal '-1 2:03:04'
  applies to both the days and hour/minute/second parts. PostgreSQL
  allows the fields to have different signs, and traditionally treats
  each field in the textual representation as independently signed, so
  that the hour/minute/second part is considered positive in this
  example. and

Internally interval values are stored as months, days, and seconds.

"Strict mode in JavaScript eliminates errors that would be ignored in non-strict mode, making code more secure. It's considered best practice to use strict mode, which is enabled by adding 'use strict'; to the code. Strict mode prevents errors such as using undeclared variables, deleting variables or functions, duplicating parameter names, and using reserved words like 'let' and 'private'. This helps maintain code quality and prevents bugs from arising later."

Extractive summary:
Strict mode eliminates errors that would be ignored in non-strict mode, thus making javascript “more secured”. Is it considered among best practices?

<strong>Yes</strong>, It's considered part of the best practices while working with javascript to include <em>Strict mode</em>. <code>'use strict'; </code>
in your code. And that's where strict mode helps out. <em>Deleting a variable or a function or an argument</em> is a no-no in strict mode. <em>Duplicating a parameter name</em> is <strong>not</strong> allowed in strict mode.

To get started in modern game programming and application programming, familiarize yourself with various specialties within the field, such as game physics, artificial intelligence, graphics, sound, scripting, UI, and network programming. Consider using an open-source game engine like OGRE 3D to gain experience in multiple areas. Develop a portfolio of small games to demonstrate your abilities, and consider starting as a tools programmer to gain experience and advance in the field.

Extractive summary:
Develop a medium sized game using it and you will get a good taste of many of the above mentioned game programming specialties.

Ground truth:
Modern game programming is tremendously complex as a whole Modern games are usually too complicated and large for one person to have a detailed and in-depth knowledge of the entire process. Recently, for my Computer Graphics course in College we used the open source OGRE 3D engine. Develop a medium sized game using it and you will get a good taste of many of the above mentioned game programming specialties. I've often heard and read articles surrounding the industry talking about the long hours, the crunch time, the unpaid overtime and the relatively lower pay when compared to other types of programming. Game programming is one area where Math is used extensively in several phases of development. Most of the articles I have read involving the industry suggest that someone with no professional experience looking to get break into gaming should put together a portfolio of small games you have written demonstrating your abilities.

Without knowing the user's intent, the best approach is to OR the terms and take the highest ranking hits. However, this may not be ideal without pre-processing the input to divine the user's intent. A possible solution is to redesign the GUI to separate the input into Name and Address, or enforce a syntax rule to differentiate between the two. Alternatively, the query can be modified to OR the terms against each table, union the results, aggregate them, and compute the highest rank.

Extractive summary:
Without knowing the user's intent, the best you can hope for is to OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits. etc...
I guess I would redesign the GUI to separate the input into Name and Address, at a minimum.

Ground truth:
This is more of a syntax problem. Without knowing the user's intent, the best you can hope for is to OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits. etc...
I guess I would redesign the GUI to separate the input into Name and Address, at a minimum. If that is not possible, enforce a syntax rule to the effect "First words will be considered a name until a comma appears, any words after that will be considered addresses"
<strong> EDIT:</strong>
Your best bet is still OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits. This is less than ideal, here's what you get for the example (in your case, you would have wanted John Doe from Hamburg to show up first): But that is the best you can do without parsing the input before submitting it to SQL to make a "best guess" at what the user wants.

To sanity check a date in Java, create a SimpleDateFormat with the desired pattern, attempt to parse the user input, and then compare the reformatted date with the original input.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
An alternative strict solution using the standard library is to perform the following:
1) Create a strict SimpleDateFormat using your pattern
2) Attempt to parse the user entered value using the format object
3) If successful, reformat the Date resulting from (2) using the same date format (from (1))
4) Compare the reformatted date against the original, user-entered value. If they're equal then the value entered strictly matches your pattern. This way, you don't need to create complex regular expressions - in my case I needed to support all of SimpleDateFormat's pattern syntax, rather than be limited to certain types like just days, months and years.

So, you are not alone, and it doesn't seem to be a problem with your install <em>(I've tried 5.1.x, but as you highlighted, it should be the same for 5.0.x)</em>
Looking at the "<code>mysqldumpslow</code>" I have under Linux, it appears it is a Perl script ; and Perl is not often installed on a Windows machine. Well, after a bit more testing, when installing MySQL, it seems <strong>you have to select "Developpers Components &gt; Scripts, examples"</strong>, which is not installed by default (at least on windows) -- no need to reinstall everything : you can "modify" the installation, to add this option. In this directory, there are some scripts ; one of them is <strong>mysqldumpslow.pl</strong> ; which is what you are looking for ;-)
Now, you "just" have to get Perl installed and running on your machine (sorry, I've never installed Perl on windows ; but you can find some informations here) Hope this helps better than what I posted before !

Rails Async Active Job doesn't execute code, while inline does, due to the way rake tasks end when they're over, causing jobs to be lost when the process crashes or is reset.

Extractive summary:
If the process crashes or the machine is reset,
  then all outstanding jobs are lost with the default async back-end. Rake processes end when they're over.

Ground truth:
With the advent of concurrent-ruby, rake tasks aren't set up to handle this. If the process crashes or the machine is reset,
  then all outstanding jobs are lost with the default async back-end. So, if you're doing any sort of data changes, rake tasks won't be open long enough to run a job, which is why they run <code>:inline</code> just fine, but not <code>:async</code>. It's why it works fine with <code>:sidekiq</code> or <code>:resque</code>, because those applications keep the job information in memory and do not release when the rake task is over. locally, there's not much you can do other than run tasks as <code>:inline</code> if you're local until rake (as a task runner) understands how to stay open while asynchronous tasks have been launched (or not). As a development only feature, this isn't really high priority, but, if you're bashing your head on the table not understanding why <code>:async</code> by default tasks that run jobs won't actually run, that's why.

The problem with using "this" in Angular's controller as syntax is not because it's a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, "this" is reserved in the context of Angular's template expressions, where it refers to the current scope. To use the controller instance, you can access it through the scope object, like this: `{{log(this.this)}}`.

Extractive summary:
Yes.
<code>this</code> is, however, reserved in the context of angular's own template expressions. It's used to refer to the current <code>scope</code> of the expression.

Ground truth:
The problem is certainly <strong>not</strong> that <code>this</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript. There's a simple way to test that JavaScript reserved words are not the issue here. Yes.
<code>this</code> is, however, reserved in the context of angular's own template expressions. And sure enough, change the template expression to <code>{{log(this.this)}}</code> and it will log the controller instance just fine.

The PHP `date()` function does not support microseconds, but they can be achieved using the following workarounds:

1. To display milliseconds: Use `microtime(true)` to get the current time in seconds and microseconds, then use `date()` to format the seconds and append the microseconds.
2. To display microseconds: Use `microtime()` to get the current time in seconds and microseconds, then use `date()` to format the seconds and append the microseconds, taking care to remove the extra space in the microseconds value.

PHP's <code>date()</code> function does not behave entirely as expected with milliseconds or microseconds as it will only except an integer, as explained in the php date docs under format character 'u'. These also eliminate race conditions and correctly formats the seconds. PHP Date with <strong>milli</strong>seconds Output = <code>2016-07-12 16:27:08.5675</code>
PHP Date with <strong>micro</strong>seconds

Question: How to make sense of this scala stacktrace?
Answer: 
The stacktrace decomposes into three parts: 
- "Subject": a description of the error, including the method and its valid signatures.
- "Verb": the problem, which is that the method cannot be applied.
- "Object": the reason, which is that the method was called with no arguments, not matching any of the valid signatures.

Extractive summary:
The verb gives you the problem, it "cannot be applied". The object gives you the why : you called it with no arguments, and this doesn't match any of the valid signatures which you were reminded of in the "Subject" part.

Ground truth:
So the whole first part is the subject, aka a description of what is concerned by the error. This subject is indeed the <code>overloaded method value split</code> followed by a reminder of the different valid signatures for this mehod. Don't search for what you did wrong here, it's only a description of the object concerned by the error ! The verb gives you the problem, it "cannot be applied". The object gives you the why : you called it with no arguments, and this doesn't match any of the valid signatures which you were reminded of in the "Subject" part.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

For a large Rails app, it's recommended to isolate concerns into separate apps, but initially start with 2-4 apps accessing the same database. This simplifies maintenance and development, but may lead to scaling issues. Consider using a master-slave database setup and caching to improve performance. Separate apps can be refactored to use Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) later on.

Extractive summary:
SOA I think is the way to go after a certain point, but SOA might be premature when you first start out. At any rate, having separate apps sets you up for SOA but you don't have to jump beyond a single db to start.

Ground truth:
I believe the benefits of isolating your concerns into separate apps outweigh the costs. Having separate apps will make each app smaller and easier to maintain. Better isolation, separate db's and inter-app communication through web APIs (SOA) and you don't have to worry about that. At any rate, having separate apps sets you up for SOA but you don't have to jump beyond a single db to start.

To open a "nul" file, specify "nul" when calling CreateFile or use the Invalid_Handle_Value constant.

Extractive summary:
To open a "nul" file, you simply specify <code>"nul"</code> when you call <code>CreateFile</code>.

Ground truth:
To open a "nul" file, you simply specify <code>"nul"</code> when you call <code>CreateFile</code>. It only looks weird because hardly anyone ever uses that file name. It's perfectly valid, though. But if you've found that <code>Invalid_Handle_Value</code> works, too, then go ahead and use that instead.

To pass a class of objects between two views in Three20, use a category to automatically add the object's userInfo property as a URL parameter. This can be retrieved in the mapped view controller using the initWithNavigatorURL:query: method.

Extractive summary:
And then you use this to retrieve it in your mapped view controller.

Ground truth:
The big problem with directly using <code>TTURLAction</code> is that you can't really use them with <code>TTTableViewItem</code>. The only way to really do it is override <code>-didSelectObject:atIndexPath:</code> and build your custom <code>TTURLAction</code> with your desired object in the <code>query</code> dictionary. But this breaks the nice separation of Model and View Controller, and gets complicated once you have multiple objects to pass. Instead of this, I've been using a small category which automatically takes the <code>userInfo</code> property of the table item (which I set to whatever I need), and automatically adds it as a URL parameter.

location ~ /users/.*/public/ {
    allow all;
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}

location /users/ {
    deny all;
}
```

This configuration uses a regular expression location to block access to any subdirectory of `/users/public/`, while the second location blocks access to the `/users/` directory itself.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Read the official docs to see difference between the modifier before the uri, You first location is a regular expression location and should use <code>~</code> or <code>*~</code> for case-sensitive and case-insensitive matches. A location can either be defined by a prefix string, or by a regular expression. Then your second location is a common location defined by a prefix string <code>/users/</code>, the modifier <code>^~</code> you use means skip the regular expression check and use the current longest matching prefix, here is the <code>/users/</code> one, so with your config you will always get a 403 return. If the longest matching prefix location has the “^~” modifier then regular expressions are not checked.

The implementation of map on a custom List type is not correct due to a misunderstanding of the filter function's signature and the use of List in the type declaration. The natural implementation of map for List would use pattern matching to handle the Nil case and the case of a non-empty list. 

A correct implementation of map for List would be:

```haskell
mapList :: (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
mapList f Nil = Nil
mapList f (t :. ls) = f t :. mapList f ls
```

This implementation correctly handles both the Nil case and the case of a non-empty list.

Ground truth:
First, to explain the error message: you can't use <code>filter</code> in your definition, since Similarly <code>filter</code> returns a Prelude list of something, but the signature requires that it return a <code>List</code> of something. Note that the program you wrote is perfectly valid, it just conflicts with the signature you gave it: Of course, if you have your own <code>filterList</code> for <code>List</code>s it will also typecheck What this function does is delete null elements from a List of Lists, like <code>Prelude.filter (not .

To add a filename column when using Pentaho data integration with a CSV input, use the Text File Input step instead, which offers more options, including adding a field for the filename.

Extractive summary:
Text File Input CSV Input

Ground truth:
but you probably will want to use the <strong>Text File Input</strong> step to parse your CSV file, rather than the <strong>CSV Input</strong> which is a subset of options from the Text File Input with some performance advantages for delimited files. With <strong>Text File Input</strong> there are a lot more options available to you for reading the file. Using this step would solve your problem because in the <em>Additional output fields</em> tab you can specify a field in the stream to put your filename, extension, file path, etc. The advantages you gain when using the <strong>CSV Input</strong> are: If you need those advantages then you'll have to get at your file name another way, such as passing it as a named parameter and adding it to the stream with the Get Variables step.

In Convolutional Neural Networks, "activations" refer to the output of an activation function, which takes input and outputs a value based on a threshold. "Activation gradients" are the slopes of these activation functions, indicating areas of interest in the image. "Weights" are the values used to calculate the output of a node, while "weight gradients" are the slopes of the cost-weight curve, representing the relationship between the loss value and the weight values.

Extractive summary:
An activation function is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some "threshold" (this is specific for each different activation function). A gradient is essentially the slope of the activation function.

Ground truth:
An activation function is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some "threshold" (this is specific for each different activation function). This comes from how neurons work, where they take some electrical input and will only activate if they reach some threshold. A gradient is essentially the slope of the activation function. This article may clear up some confusion on weights and activation functions. The "max activation" and "min activation" values make sense for a ReLu: the minimum value will be zero and the max is whatever the maximum value is.

To save memory space, store the counter in an extra int variable. Consider creating a method like GetNextFileName() that generates the next filename.

Extractive summary:
I think you should just store the counter in an int.

Ground truth:
I think you should just store the counter in an int. I understand that you want to save memory space but to be honest, an extra int is really in the "acceptable" category. <strong>EDIT</strong>: You probably want to have a method like GetNextFileName() in your class that generates you the next filename (being able to refactor your code into small bits is important, much more important than saving memory space):

Bundle multiple related applications into one Rails app to avoid duplicating classes, reduce memory consumption, and simplify database sharing. Use subdomain routing (e.g., subdomain-fu) to handle different subdomains (e.g., sales, users) with unique roots.

Extractive summary:
Compiling it into one application eliminates this issue. For the issue between the sales site and the users site having to have different roots that can be solved, as mentioned earlier, by subdomain_fu.

Ground truth:
I would bundle this all into the same app because you won't be duplicating the classes (models, plugins, etc.) across all the apps. Also: running 4 apps means that you'll have 4 processes all consuming memory due to the 4 separate Rails stacks they have loaded. Compiling it into one application eliminates this issue. For the issue between the sales site and the users site having to have different roots that can be solved, as mentioned earlier, by subdomain_fu. Lastly, compiling it all into one mega-super-hyper-app will eliminate the database-sharing issues.

Java singletons can make testing difficult due to their static nature, making it hard to mock or replace them in tests.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
All Java singleton patterns (both this and the standard with private constructor and static accessor) have this bad property that if you to test them (or test anything that even remotely depends on them) can use this and only this object. For example if you want to test <code>PrintingService</code> class that depends on <code>PrintingSingleton</code> you will not be able to replace this printing singleton with a mock because it is bound statically. Personally, I would just avoid using singletons that way but rather introduce dependency injection, via Guice, Spring or Pico Container. That way you ensure existence of only one object, while not limiting yourself to not being able to mock the object out for example for tests.

Ground truth:
A property list can only handle specific classes (see "What is a Property List?"), which <code>GKAchievement</code> is not one of. <code>NSUserDefaults</code> uses property lists, so that's also out. <code>GKAchievement</code> does, however, conform to the <code>NSCoding</code> protocol, which means you can easily save them to disk using an <code>NSKeyedArchiver</code>.

However, you are passing the object you've already told <code>Gson</code> to serialize. which I hope you can see is going into recursive loop.

Recursion is not recommended for web spiders due to the risk of infinite loops, but can be used if only a certain level of links is needed.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Recursion seems to be appropriate - until you think a bit more about it. you're stuck in an endless cycle. Recursion is not any more CPU intensive than doing it in a "normal" way. You have to ask yourself whether you need all the links or if it's suffice to only grab links down to a certain level. In the latter case this also solves your endless cycle problem.

In Java, instanceof and casts are generally not necessary in well-designed code due to the use of generics. However, they may still occur in some cases. A castOrNull method can be seen as unnatural and hiding temporary variables, suggesting that code should be examined to remove unnecessary casts.

Extractive summary:
With the addition of generics many cases of casts (and thus instanceof) are not needed. They do, on occasion still occur.

Ground truth:
In most well written/designed Java code the use of instanceof and casts never happens. With the addition of generics many cases of casts (and thus instanceof) are not needed. The biggest problem when changing from one language to another is adopting the conventions of the new language. Generally speaking casts are "evil" in Java because they are usually not needed. Your method is more "evil" because it is not written in the way most people would expect Java to be written.

It is not recommended to call the class that created you due to tight coupling. Instead, consider the following alternatives: 

1. Get the required data from the child and pass it to the parent.
2. Pass data from the parent to the child and put the method there.
3. Call the method in the parent and pass the result to the child.
4. Use inheritance if it makes sense.

Extractive summary:
Get needed data from the 'child' and call the method in the 'parent' with that data Pass the data the 'parent' holds to the 'child' and put the method there so the 'child' can call it Call the method in the 'parent' and pass the result to the 'child'

Ground truth:
I think what you call a parent-child relationship is just a composition (the 'parent' holds an instance of an unrelated in the hierarchy class, the 'child'). If my assumption is correct, then this smells bad because the two classes would be tightly coupled and that points to bad design somewhere (the 'parent', the 'child' or both). Less smelly alternatives:

We don't have covariance of generic types yet, I'm afraid. You can do <code>IQueryable&lt;Tax&gt;</code>, but not <code>IQueryable&lt;ITax&gt;</code>. You could introduce a conversion, but it'll probably break composability, rendering it useless.

To map classes in NHibernate using roles or composition, define a Person class with common properties and a Role superclass with sub-classes (e.g. DoctorRole, PatientRole, EmployeeRole). Establish a many-to-many relationship between Person and Role using an Association class (e.g. PeopleRole) or collections in both classes.

Extractive summary:
So a Role will have a set of Persons. Or a Person will have a set of Roles or both. The Person class can have a Collection of roles defined and the Role class can have a Collection of people defined.

Ground truth:
You probably want to consider using the Roles. This would probably imply that there is an Association class that maps persons to roles. Define a Person class with all properties that are common to people. Then define a Role super class and DoctorRole, PatientRole and EmployeeRole sub classes (Assuming that each role has different properties). The Person class can have a Collection of roles defined and the Role class can have a Collection of people defined. This page explains how to do the mapping so that PeopleRole is a composite element. Your Person is like Order, PeopleRole is like LineItem and Role is like Product.

The ternary operator (?:) can be chosen over a traditional if-else block for improved readability, especially in complex decision trees. It allows for a more concise and chained expression of multiple conditions, making the code easier to understand.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The real difference is that it selects a final result. Really, just syntactic sugar that improves readability. It can be argued that it is just a matter of style, thus subjective. But, the legibility becomes even greater when you have a more complex decision tree, such as: You can chain together many decisions in one place instead of writing a bunch of nested if-then-else clauses: This is somewhat following a code pattern called method chaining.

Creating a Calendar object is slow and complex due to handling date/time oddities. Using a Date object is more economical for getting a date in string format.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Creating a Calendar object is a relatively slow and complex action, it has to compensate for all the oddities that are inherent to dates and times such as timezones, daylight savings etc. Your best bet is to use the Date object as your first example, see here for a comparison on performance metrics of Date, Calendar and SimpleDateFormat. Whilst the difference between Java Date and JodaTime is probably negligible in performance terms, JodaTime is generally agreed to be a better way of handling dates and times. For your purpose, importing JodaTime just for a timestamp may well be overkill though.

Since the port is completely random, there are certainly no forwarding rules for that port on the firewall, so connection is denied.

To insert form data into two different tables on a database through a JSP page, two approaches are possible: 

1. Create two separate Statement instances for each insert operation.
2. Reuse a single Statement instance, closing resources in a Finally block or using a try-catch-resource block (Java 7+).

Additionally, best practices include avoiding Java code in JSP files, using PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection attacks, and ensuring foreign keys in reference tables are not auto-incrementing.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Solution 1
Create two different Statement instances for your two insert operations. Solution 2
If you want to reuse one single Statement instance, close the resources in a <strong>Finally</strong> block. It is highly recommended that you avoid using java code in jsp file. Use PreparedStatement instead of Statement to avoid sql injection attack. Please make the foreign keys not auto_increment and when you insert to the reference table <strong>Dest_has_Categories</strong>, please insert existing <strong>Categories</strong>'s id and <strong>Dest</strong>'s id.

Generated abstractive summary:
The NHibernate mapping of classes can be approached by first modeling the domain well, considering concepts such as roles and composition. This involves separating the identity of a participant from the role they play in an activity, using separate objects to capture additional information for each role. For example, a Person object can be used to capture the identity of a person, while separate objects like Student and Tutor can capture additional details for each role, allowing for flexibility and easy introduction of new roles.

Extractive summary:
For example, you might have a Person object that captures the identify of a particular person.

Ground truth:
It seems to me that this is more a question around how to model a domain well, rather than an NHibernate mapping issue. Once you've sorted out your domain modelling, I think you'll find the NHibernate mapping falls out relatively easily. One place to look to get your head around the idea of modeling Roles is to look for "Color Modeling" - Jeff de Luca has some resources, though the idea originated with Peter Coad
The basic idea is to separate the identity of a participant from the role they play in an activity. This structure gives you great flexibility - one person (Joe Bloggs) may just be a student, another person (Jane Doe) may just be a tutor, and a third (Chuck Norris) may be both. Also, introducing another role (Lecturer, Marker, Administrator) becomes easier because the additions don't require changes to existing objects.

TortoiseSVN's "modified file" status doesn't necessarily mean svn diff will show differences, as it looks at changes from the previous version in your working copy, not the actual modified files.

Ground truth:
Diff with previous is a different command than looking what changed in your workingcopy. Previous is defined to be the version before the version you have in your workingcopy: If you don't see changes against PREVIOUS, your workingcopy reverted the changes of COMMITTED

Cannot use polymorphism because of generic base class: This is not possible in C# as it would create a circular reference. To solve this, move the type parameter to the factory method and restrict its usage to the base class type.

Extractive summary:
The logic has been swapped around so the derived type is given to the factory method instead of the factory method being called on it.

Ground truth:
you're using Derived1 in two different ways according to the base class. This is not wrong (if that's what you really want), but it's unusual for most programming scenarios; you normally choose one or the other. However the benefit of your logic is: not only do you have an implicit instance of Derived1 through inheritance (same for any other derived class), but the base class can <em>also</em> handle other external instances of that same derived type through the type parameter <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> One Solution...
One possible (and strong solution) is to move the Type parameter from the class to the factory Create method and restrict its usage to the Base class type like so: Your factory method is restricted to create only instances of derived types.

Use a single Rails application with roles for user filtering and consider using authorization frameworks like declarative_authorization or cancan for future scalability and flexibility.

Extractive summary:
I'd keep everything on single application - and use roles for filtering what each user can see and do. Have a look at authorization frameworks, such as declarative_authorization or cancan.

Ground truth:
The biggest issue I see with separating into several apps is that you lose flexibility. I'd keep everything on single application - and use roles for filtering what each user can see and do. It might be a bit more difficult at the begining, but it pays up in the near future.

Local variables in Magento have an underscore prefix as a coding convention to indicate they are loosely coupled with an object and owned by something else.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
No certain answer here, but I believe it's just an internal magento team coding convention. I'm sure you're aware of the underscore prefix's history in programming in general. It's not too much of a stretch to think that 

local variables used in a view script that are loosely coupled with an object are similar to private or protected variables  

In other words, the underscore serves as a warning that 

hey, the contents of this variable doesn't just belong to this view, it's owned by something else  

Part of the problem is there's no "official" recommendations from Zend, or anyone else, what sort of naming conventions should be used in phtml files.

To insert multiple rows in a UITableView, use `insertRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation:` and modify the data model between `beginUpdates` and `endUpdates`. 

Here is an example implementation: 

- Create an array of indexPaths to insert
- Modify the data model (e.g. add or remove objects)
- Call `beginUpdates`
- Call `insertRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation:` or `deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation:`
- Call `endUpdates`

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The <code>insertRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation:</code> AND the changes to your data model <strong>both need to occur in-between</strong> <code>beginUpdates</code> and <code>endUpates</code>
I've created a simple example that should work on its own. I spent a week fiddling around trying to figure this out since I couldn't find any simple examples, so I hope this saves someone time and headache!

If you have the Mapping Toolbox installed, it provides a function called <code>polyxpoly</code> that allows you to intersect polylines, so you can find the intersection of the whole rectangle against every wall, and you will not have to worry about splitting every edge of the rectangle. Here you have a full working example of a collision with one wall: You can try with different positions of the bird to test the collision detection:

To schedule actions at various timings from a list in Python, use the `viztask.schedule` function to schedule a function that uses `viztask.waitTime` to wait for each specified time, and then execute the scheduled function with `viz.go()`. 

Here is an example of the code:
```python
import viz
import viztask

def myfunc():
    for cuetime in (2, 3, 4):
        mydata = yield viztask.waitTime(cuetime)
        print('Wait time: ', cuetime, ' - Elapsed time: ', mydata.elapsed)

viz.go()
viztask.schedule(myfunc)
```
This will output the wait time and elapsed time for each specified time. Note that the timing differences may be related to the frame rate.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
busfault is correct about your use of the FOR loop. To test it using <code>yield</code>, you need to <code>schedule</code> the called function. You'll find that the timing mismatch is usually related to your frame rate ( 60 Hz ~ 16.7ms) Following edit by OP:
.. an easy way to test if the timing differences are due to the frame syncing is to turn off Vertical sync (V-Sync) for your graphics card and re-run it - I suspect you'll get much better timings, however you might get frame tearing on your display  - then it's your call as to what is more important to you, image quality or timing accuracy. I notice you've gone back to using time.time() - this will be LESS accurate than using the return object from waitTime as per my demo  (ie <code>mydata = yield viztask.waitTime( cuetime)</code> ... )

It is beneficial to implement AutoCloseable in a Java class if it has a close operation, as it allows for the use of try-with-resource syntax.

Extractive summary:
If your class has some semantic of <code>close</code>ing it, you should probably have it implement <code>AutoClosable</code>.

Ground truth:
There's no problem in having a class implement <code>AutoClosable</code> even if it's super class doesn't. If your class has some semantic of <code>close</code>ing it, you should probably have it implement <code>AutoClosable</code>. It costs almost nothing to do so, if at all, and it allows you to use Java 7's neat syntactic sugaring of the try-with-resource syntax.

There is no way to ignore a component's PreferredSize in GridBagLayout. However, there are alternative options to achieve relative sizing, including using the "weightx" constraint or the Relative Layout.

Extractive summary:
You could use the "weightx" constraint.

Ground truth:
There is no such concept as "units" in GridBagLayout. A GBL uses cells. Each component will originally be sized at its preferred size. If you want truly relative sizes then you can use the Relative Layout. It allows you to specify the size of components relative to the total space available, so the preferred size can be ignored.

Ground truth:
This will allow <code>1000 / 4</code> numbers or <code>250</code>. Another bug: You were never filling the first element of <code>array</code>. Another [minor] bug is that you're relying on <code>$t2</code> to have a zero value without explicitly setting it. Here's the cleaned up code. I added a limit check on the user's count Printing the array is similar to the input of the array. I've reworked the previous example code. I removed the hardwired limit value of 250 in favor of using a new label: <code>arrend</code> [so, have a look]
Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array.

Question: SQL Server : query with multiple LEFT OUTER JOIN and WHERE conditions
Answer: The placement of conditions in a LEFT OUTER JOIN affects the result. Conditions in the ON clause preserve all rows from the driving table with NULLs for unmatched rows in the slave table, while conditions in the WHERE clause filter out unmatched rows.

Extractive summary:
<strong>Left Outer Join - ON clause vs WHERE clause</strong>
For a left outer join, for the same condition, there is a big difference depending on where it is placed - the join clause or the where clause. <strong>Condition in ON clause</strong> Here, the columns of the driving table is preserved but the join clause NULLs the non-matched row(s) in the slave table.

Ground truth:
<strong>Left Outer Join - ON clause vs WHERE clause</strong>
For a left outer join, for the same condition, there is a big difference depending on where it is placed - the join clause or the where clause. As expected, all rows from driving table with NULLs for no match from slave table. <strong>Condition in ON clause</strong> Here, the columns of the driving table is preserved but the join clause NULLs the non-matched row(s) in the slave table. <strong>Condition in WHERE clause</strong> This gives only the matched row(s) because the where clause filters out all rows that do not match the conditions which are applied after the join clause on a row by row basis.

Extractive summary:
Make sure your new field is displayed in this list. 3) Make sure you are trying to output this value in the right place of XSLT template.

Ground truth:
Your approach is okey, couple of things to check:
1) Each Data View Web Part has the DataFields tag, it looks like this: Make sure your new field is displayed in this list. 2) Also there is difference between internal field name and field name. In the example above <strong>Comments</strong> is internal name but name is <strong>Notes</strong>. So to display Notes field correctly you should use: 3) Make sure you are trying to output this value in the right place of XSLT template. The easiest way to find the place is to look for existing fields and just add the new one along these.

Ground truth:
The problem is that there's no such class as Class (and as a side note, this nonexistent class also doesn't respond to <code>classNamed:</code>). It's not quite clear whether you want to <em>create</em> a class or get a <em>reference</em> to a class. If the latter, you want the function <code>NSClassFromString()</code>. If you want to dynamically create a class at runtime, you'll need to use the Objective-C runtime functions to create a class, register it and add methods as appropriate.

The 'Unknown key(s)' ArgumentError occurs when trying to use a nested hash in the params. To fix it, use `params[:name_ids].keys` to get the array of IDs and `params[:name_ids][name.id.to_s].reject { |k,v| v.blank? }` to update the attributes. The issue arises from a misunderstanding of how `fields_for` creates the params hash, resulting in a nested hash instead of an array of IDs.

Extractive summary:
EDIT (brief-ish explanation):
What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids]. which is what calling params[:name_ids].keys gives you.

Ground truth:
Likely you need to get just the keys from the name_ids hash. A separate problem is your reference to params[:name], which is nil. EDIT (brief-ish explanation):
What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids]. An ActiveRecord 'find' method can take an array of ids, but not a hash of values. There was no value ':name' in params, so calling 'reject' on it cause the 'no method' error -- there is no 'reject' method on the nil object. What you wanted was to update the attributes for the 'name' that corresponded to the particular name in the loop. meant that params would contain a hash called 'name_ids', with keys corresponding to name.id, that themselves would contain hashes of attributes that ActiveRecord could use in the update_attributes method.

To prevent losing SVN history during file refactoring, use a Subversion client like AnkhSVN or VisualSVN, which can track file renames and maintain version history.

Extractive summary:
This will track your file-renames and you won't lose the history in subversion. File renames are tracked by the subversion client.

Ground truth:
You could install the (free) visual studio add-in AnkhSVN. This will track your file-renames and you won't lose the history in subversion. If you rename files without using the subversion client (using windows explorer or visual studio solution explorer instead of TortoiseSVN or AnkhSVN), then subversion won't recognise the rename operation (only a delete and an add operation). BTW: using AnkhSVN gives you some other advantages, such as the displaying the subversion status of files directly in the solution explorer. Alternatively there's also VisualSVN, which is comparable to AnkhSVN, but is commercial.

For a three-table database system, use separate tables for articles, tags, and a link table relating articles and tags. For searching, use "like" with percents, regex, or full text search.

Extractive summary:
Q1 - you're better off with three separate tables for articles, tags, and a link table relating articles and tags.

Ground truth:
Q1 - you're better off with three separate tables for articles, tags, and a link table relating articles and tags. You could also do it with two tables for articles and an articles_tags table. Either two or three tables makes it easy to find which articles have a given tag and which tags are assigned to a given article. Q2 - title and description searches could be done using "like" with percents or with regex or full text search. Q3 - don't worry about joining the tags tables with the others. Q4 - It depends what you want to get out of the results. Q5 - again, you'd have to use "like" syntax and maybe some creative regex on the PHP side before the query is handed off to the database.

DataOutputStream may not guarantee that all data is available at once, as its available() method does not guarantee the total number of bytes in the stream. To ensure all data is received, consider sending the total number of bytes before the data and using that to allocate the buffer.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The contract of <code>in.available()</code> does not guarantee anything. It is never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream. Your code basically rely on / assume that all data sent, will be available immediately and reported accordingly by <code>in.available()</code>. To make sure you get all data, you could, on the sender side, start by sending an integer, telling how many bytes will be sent: You could for instance use <code>str.getBytes("UTF-8")</code> and <code>new String(bytes, "UTF-8")</code> to be sure the receiver interprets the bytes the way the sender intended.

To troubleshoot intermittent "No application is associated" errors when launching .DOC files with Process.Start(), check the file association settings in Windows Explorer under Tools->Folder Options->File Types->DOC->Advanced->Open->Edit, ensuring the Application path and DDE settings are correct.

Extractive summary:
Open Windows Explorer, and check what is defined under Tools-&gt;Folder Options-&gt;File Types-&gt;DOC-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Open-&gt;Edit.

Ground truth:
I would suspect that the file association on your system is somewhat broken. </li>

It might be that there is no <em>Advanced</em> button on the <em>File Types</em> dialog when DOC is selected, and that instead a <em>Restore</em> button is present. This is the case if a user has manually changed the file association using the <em>Open With...</em> option from the context menu of .doc files. Try if clicking on restore solves your problem.

It seems like the provided answer is more of a statement about memory usage rather than a solution to an automatic incrementing filename question. However, I can create a summary based on the context of the answer.

### Example
Question: automatic incrementing filename
Answer: <p>"least amount of memory" is NOT equals to "no or little variables"</p>

<p>Local variables only takes little memory itself.
But object creation in heap takes a lot more, and they require GC to do cleanup.</p>

<p>In your example, your ToCharArray() and ToString() have created 4 object (indirect created object not included).</p>

Summary: Local variables use little memory, but object creation in the heap takes more memory and requires garbage collection.

Extractive summary:
"least amount of memory" is NOT equals to "no or little variables"

To enable WTP translation output in Eclipse, add the automated tests download in the 3.1 branch and use Ctrl+Shift+9 to generate the translation, noting that the output may not be 100% accurate.

Right now you'd have to add the separate automated tests download to do this, and only in the 3.1 branch, but it enables a "Show Translation" command through Ctrl+Shift+9. Beware that the translation generated isn't 100% the same as the server would create at runtime--it's not intended to be executed. Also, the most recent 3.0.3 builds contain fixes to the translator that should clear up these kinds of problems (NESTED variables + self-closing tags).

Client customizations can be achieved by separating the main application from customer-specific features, which are stored in text-form configuration files (e.g., XML). A build system gathers the application and customer repository to create a customized version.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I would be tempted to arrange things so that customization is in text-form (possibly XML, but I guess that's not the only option), and the main application is generic, and gets the customer specific features by parsing those configuration files. You could then have a repository for each customer, containing configuration files (and possibly resources, like logos, and/or custom scripts), and a repository for the main application. For a given customer version, your build system then automatically gathers the application and the customer's repository, and builds the custom version. It makes things a little bit more complex on the application side at first, because you need to add parsing functionality, but it makes management of various customer versions a lot simpler, and somewhat less error prone.

Here's a concise summary of the answer:

To maintain cache state across different servers, consider using consistent hashing, which maps keys to specific servers in a cluster, minimizing data replication and disruption when servers are added or removed. This approach is suitable for large-scale applications, but a replicated cache may be a simpler starting point.

Extractive summary:
This would be a alternative to a replicated cache. Consistent hashing is used at large scale. A replicated cache is possibly a good idea to <em>start with</em>.

Ground truth:
If you ultimately decide to move the cache outside your main webserver process, then you could also take a look at consistent hashing. This would be a alternative to a replicated cache. The problem with replicated caches, is they scale inversely proportional to the number of nodes participating in the cache. So each caching server is responsible for a fraction of the overall keys, the client can determine which server will contain the sought data without any lookup, and data and eviction messages do not need to be replicated between caching servers. Consistent hashing is used at large scale.

Yes, it is perfectly legal to declare a pure virtual function twice in a class hierarchy. This redundancy does not change the program's meaning and leaves the option to provide a definition for the function in the subclass.

Ground truth:
Yes, it is perfectly legal. In most situations the declaration on f() in B doesn't change the meaning of the program in any way, but there's nothing wrong with a little redundancy. Recall that the "= 0" means only that the class may not be instantiated directly; that all pure virtual function must be overridden before an object can be instantiated. You can even provide a definition for a pure virtual function, which can be called on an instance of a subclass. By explicitly declaring B::f(), you leave open the option of giving a definition for B::f().

Summary: The query with multiple LEFT OUTER JOIN and WHERE conditions is interpreted differently by SQL Server, and expressions on columns in outer joined tables are only meaningful in the ON clause.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
No DB engine would interpret the queries the same unless you have some kind of ANSI NULLS switch confusing the issue in your 2005 DB. They are different and expressions on columns in outer joined tables are meaningless outside of the ON clause (whether you understand it or agree with it or not). The confusion lies with you, not SQL Server. What you are questioning is as expected. Fix your query!

Creating another index on `col5` may improve query performance, as MySQL can use the index for LIKE comparisons when the argument is a constant string starting with a non-wildcard character.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
I doubt that rewriting the query would help. The second part of your condition requires to read the whole content of the table anyway. You could try to <strong>create another index</strong> on <code>col5</code>, since documentation states that

The index also can be used for LIKE comparisons if the argument to LIKE is a constant string that does not start with a wildcard character.

Valgrind reports memory leaks in a program due to two main reasons: the program's use of GLib's slab memory allocator, which can be disabled by setting the environment variable `G_SLICE=always-malloc`, and static memory allocation by GTK and its underlying libraries, which is not a real leak but can be ignored via a suppressions file.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You're not doing anything wrong. GTK widgets use reference counting, but in your programme all the references are taken care of, so you're not (manually) leaking anything. Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, Valgrind will still report that your app leaks memory. The reason for this is that GTK (and its underlying libraries) allocate some "static" memory at start-up that doesn't get freed until the programme quits. This isn't really a problem, because typically the programme ends as soon as <code>gtk_main()</code> returns, and then the OS frees any remaining resources, so you're not <em>really</em> leaking anything. Valgrind thinks you are though, and for this reason it would be nice to have a <code>gtk_deinit()</code> function, but sadly there isn't one. The best you can do instead is to teach Valgrind to ignore these things, via a suppressions file.

.then() can only be used on functions that return a Promise. It cannot be used on any function.

Extractive summary:
<code>.then()</code> can't be used on any function. Only a function that returns some form of a Promise.

Ground truth:
<code>.then()</code> can't be used on any function. Only a function that returns some form of a Promise. I would review the MDN docs on Promises, Promise.prototype.then, and Promises in Angular using $q.
In your case, only <code>commentsService.getComments($routeParams.id)</code> returns a Promise, so <code>.then()</code> can be called on it. <code>commentsService.getComments($routeParams.id).then()</code> also returns a Promise that resolves after the function in the <code>.then()</code> block runs, therefore you can simply add a <code>return</code> to chain the Promise created.

Closes this resource, relinquishing any underlying resources. This method is invoked automatically on objects managed by the try-with-resources statement.

The user's original method for resetting a pointer to an array of chars is correct but can be improved. A simpler way to reset the pointer is to use the base address of the array directly (e.g., `nR = newResBuffer`). Alternatively, the code can be rewritten to use a variable `j` to index the array, eliminating the need for a pointer altogether. Additionally, the `sscanf` function can be replaced with `atoi` or `strtol` for converting the string buffer to an integer.

Extractive summary:
Your method of resetting the pointer is correct, although there are some easier ways to achieve it. <strong>19432</strong>
  MAXCNT: 38863
  nR address before reset: <strong>0x10779f065</strong>
  nR address after reset: <strong>0x10779f060</strong> 

I mentioned earlier that there are some easier ways for you to reset the pointer. You can also use <code>atoi()</code> or <code>strtol()</code> instead of <code>sscanf()</code> to convert the string buffer to an <code>int</code> (or <code>long</code>).

Ground truth:
Your method of resetting the pointer is correct, although there are some easier ways to achieve it. I assume that your error must be somehow related setting the MAXCNT register or reading new data from the receive register. I tested your code by replacing the Raspberry Pi specific register usage with standard C functions for reading from stdin and printing to <code>stdout</code>. It's easy to test and see that the part of the code that involves receiving an individual char digit, storing it in a string buffer, converting that buffer to an int, and reusing the buffer, are all correct. <strong>19432</strong>
  MAXCNT: 38863
  nR address before reset: <strong>0x10779f065</strong>
  nR address after reset: <strong>0x10779f060</strong> 

I mentioned earlier that there are some easier ways for you to reset the pointer. You can actually do it without using <code>nRreset</code>; since the base address for <code>newResBuffer</code> never changes, you can simply reset it with <code>nR = newResBuffer</code>. An even easier way to do it would be not to use a moving pointer at all and simply use the variable <code>j</code> You can also use <code>atoi()</code> or <code>strtol()</code> instead of <code>sscanf()</code> to convert the string buffer to an <code>int</code> (or <code>long</code>).

Java Multithreading Synchronization with Locks uses a queue implemented as a linked list to manage waiting threads, with "fair" locks adding threads to the end of the queue and "unfair" locks allowing a thread to acquire the lock immediately if it's free.

Extractive summary:
The short answer is that each lock has a queue of waiting threads that is implemented as a linked list. In the "fair" case, a thread that tries to acquire the lock when the queue is non-empty is added to the end of the queue.

Ground truth:
The details are in the source code. And the source code can be found by Googling for: The code is exceptionally well commented. The short answer is that each lock has a queue of waiting threads that is implemented as a linked list. In the "unfair" case, a thread may barge in if the lock is currently free.

The issue of saving a pandas DataFrame from Google Colab to Google Drive takes a long time, with a workaround being to save the file locally in /content/ and then copy it to the Google Drive mount directory.

Extractive summary:
<strong>Workaround</strong>: First save to /content/, the colab's host machine's local dir. Then copy the file from /content to your gdrive mount dir.

Ground truth:
If you find calling df.to_feather("somewhere on your gdrive") from google colab and it is on the order of ~X00mb, you may find sporadic performance. It can take anywhere between a few min to a whole hour to save a file. First save to /content/, the colab's host machine's local dir. This seems to work much more consistently and faster for me.

Extractive summary:
You are mixing concepts. You don't make branches into bare repositories. Branches exist within a repository (independently of it being bare or not). Bare repositories are used for specific use cases, but in normal development, you wouldn't use them.

Ground truth:
You are mixing concepts.

In Django code, it's recommended to disconnect signals and do monkey-patching in the `ready()` method of the application's `AppConfig` class.

Extractive summary:
My opinion is that if the recommended way to connect signals is to do it in the <code>ready()</code> method of your <code>AppConfig</code>, disconnecting signals and related monkeypatching should also be done in this method.

Ground truth:
I would say yes, but I think there is no clear right or wrong here, with regards to connecting signals, the Django docs state the following:

Strictly speaking, signal handling and registration code can live
  anywhere you like, although it’s recommended to avoid the
  application’s root module and its models module to minimize
  side-effects of importing code. In practice, signal handlers are usually defined in a signals
  submodule of the application they relate to. My opinion is that if the recommended way to connect signals is to do it in the <code>ready()</code> method of your <code>AppConfig</code>, disconnecting signals and related monkeypatching should also be done in this method. Write some sort of unit tests or integration tests to ensure that my code does what I want it to do, even when updating dependencies etc.

To find vulnerabilities in code, use a combination of compiler options, static source code analyzers, and dynamic analyzers. Increase the warning level of your compiler and use options like -pedantic for GCC. Analyze control and data flows, considering potential issues with functions like scanf(), and review documentation and the C standard.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
How can I find vulnerabilities in this code? With experience, a good set of compiler options, a static source code analyzer, a dynamic analyzer, ... anything you know how to use. If you don't know how to use such, I'm afraid that you have to learn. You can find the worst problems by raising the warning level of your compiler to the max and even give option like <code>-pedantic</code> for GCC. The same applies to the analyzers of which the static kind is quite simple to use. Then think about what will happen further down the control flow. Do this for every function call, every assignment, and every instruction. Yes, a lot of people know this.

The provided code has a deadlock issue due to a non-blocking `recv()` call followed by a `send()` call on a `ZMQ_REP` socket. To resolve this, use a blocking `recv()` call, a non-blocking `poll()` call, or a `recv()` call with a timeout before attempting to send data.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Welcome to the domain of the Zen-of-Zero
<strong>Suspect #1:</strong> the code jumps straight into an unresolveable live-lock due to a move into ill-directed state of the distributed-Finite-State-Automaton: While I since ever advocate for preferring non-blocking .<code>recv()</code>-s, the code above simply commits suicide right by using this step:
<strong><code>socket.recv( request, zmq::recv_flags::dontwait ); // socket being == ZMQ_REP</code></strong>
kills all chances for any other future life but the very error  <em><code>The zmq_send() operation cannot be performed on this socket at the moment due to the socket not being in the appropriate state.</code></em>
as
going into the <strong><code>.send()</code></strong>-able state is possible <strong>if and only if</strong> a previous <code>.recv()</code>-ed has delivered a real message. The Best Next Step :
Review the code and may either use a blocking-form of the <code>.recv()</code> before going to <code>.send()</code> or, better, use a { blocking | non-blocking }-form of <code>.poll( { 0 | timeout }, ZMQ_POLLIN )</code> before entering into an attempt to <code>.recv()</code> and keep doing other things, if there is nothing to receive yet ( so as to avoid the self suicidal throwing the dFSA into an uresolvable collision, flooding your <code>stdout/stderr</code> with a second-spaced flow of <code>printf(" ERROR: The Problem 1 :
On the contrary to the suicidal <code>::dontwait</code> flag in the Problem 2 root cause, the Problem 2 root cause is, that a blocking-form of the first <code>.recv()</code> here moves all the worker-threads into an undeterministically long, possibly infinite, waiting-state, as the <code>.recv()</code>-blocks proceeding to any further step until a real message arrives ( which it does not seem from the MCVE, that it ever will ) and so your pool-of-threads remains in a pool-wide blocked-waiting-state and nothing will ever happen until any message arrived. Update on how the <code>REQ/REP</code> works :
The <strong><code>REQ/REP</code></strong> The code is not a reproducible MCVE. Persevere, ZeroMQ took me some time of scratching my own head, yet the years after I took a due care to learn the Zen-of-Zero are still a rewarding eternal walk in the Gardens of Paradise. No localhost serial-code IDE will ever be able to "debug" a distributed-system (unless a distributed-inspector infrastructure is inplace, a due architecture for a distributed-system monitor/tracer/debugger is another layer of distributed messaging/signaling layer atop of the debugged distributed messaging/signaling system - so do not expect it from a trivial localhost serial-code IDE.

GNOME keyrings can be accessed from Ruby using the keyring gem or gir_ffi-gnome_keyring gem. The keyring gem allows you to interact with the default keyring, while gir_ffi-gnome_keyring provides more control over keyring usage, including the ability to use other keyrings and unlock them if necessary.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Unfortunately the <code>keyring</code> gem does not allow you to use anything other than the default keyring. To use other keyrings, or if you just want to cut out the middle-man: If the keyring is unlocked (which it probably will be, because by default it uses your login keyring which is automatically unlocked when you log in) then reads and writes will work without any issues. If the keyring is locked, then you will be prompted to supply a password to unlock the keyring, before any reading or writing can happen. Then you probably need to install the gnome-keyring headers (<code>apt install libgnome-keyring-dev</code>)

The MVC 5 BeginCollectionItem Model Always Null issue is caused by incorrect usage of the BeginCollectionItem method and hidden input fields. To fix this, pass the correct name to the BeginCollectionItem method, and remove hidden inputs for each property.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Your collection property is named <code>mylist</code> therefore you must pass that name to the <code>BeginCollectionItem</code> method However, you have other issues with your code. The <code>DefaultModelBinder</code> binds the first name/value pair matching a model property and ignores any subsequent name/value pairs with the same name. Because you have a hidden input for each property before the textbox, only the initial values you sent to the view will be bound when you submit, not the edited values. You including 2 inputs and a button, but that will not bind to your model and will not correctly add items to your collection (your add button needs to use ajax to call a server method that returns another partial view and append it to the DOM)

When sending a large amount of data to SQL Server, it may appear that nothing is happening, but the data is actually being processed. This can be due to a timeout setting, which can be adjusted to allow for more time to process the data.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When sending a large amount of data to Sql Server to be saved this is most likely what you are observing, it appears that nothing is happening when in fact this data has to be sent to the server and then processed and<code>500 MB</code> could take a while for that to happen. after 200 seconds due to a time out. If this is not desirable then you need to figure out good balance between time and batch size based on the amount of time it takes per XX MB. The only way you can measure that is by testing with various batch sizes as it is dependent on your environment (network capacity, sql server load, client load among other things).

There are three methods to reset JTable cells to their previous values: 

1. Create a new TableModel and reset the table's model to it.
2. Track changes using a HashMap to store original cell values and restore them when needed.
3. Use a Table Cell Listener to save original values when changes occur.

Extractive summary:
You can use the Table Cell Listener to listen for changes to the TableModel.

Ground truth:
You can just create a new TableModel using this data and reset the model of the table. However the problem is that you need two copies of the data.

one which doesn't require creating two identical data arrays. So you could keep a <code>HashMap</code> where the key is the row/column and the data is the original value. So on a "Cancel" you would just iterate through the <code>HashMap</code> and restore the data for each key found in the Map. You can use the Table Cell Listener to listen for changes to the TableModel.

Here's a concise summary of the given answer:

Autocomplete algorithms are an open problem with various strategies, each with their pros and cons. Some well-known strategies include:

- **Brute Force**: Simple to implement but has a high time complexity.
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Simple and efficient, but requires small data size.
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Reduces space complexity by merging similar subpaths.
- **Other Tree options**: Radix Tree, Suffix Tree, Suggest Tree, and Merkle Tree, which offer trade-offs between space and time complexity.
- **Prioritizing Offers**: Markov Chain can be used to prioritize next states, offering more accurate results.
- **Artificial Intelligence strategies**: Good models are small, fast, and store discriminative features, but require understanding input topology and have long training times.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Can be used for time series problems, offering long-term learning power.
- **Transformers**: Highly promising for predicting future sequences, with models like Google BERT being game-changers.

Extractive summary:
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is one of the options.

Ground truth:
based on my knowledge, I list a short highlights of some of well known Auto Completion strategies and their corresponding data structures. also I tried to summarizing their major <em><strong>pros</strong></em> and <em><strong>cons</strong></em> related to <strong>Auto Completion</strong> problem. <strong>Brute Force</strong> : <strong>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</strong> :
Trie has space problem so other data structures main goal is reducing the space complexity. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is one of the options. linear search is the worst case option so most strategies improved their search time by using either sorting( <em>O(nlog(n)</em> ) and then using Binary search( <em>O(log(n)</em>) ) or using a hashtable ( <em>O(1)</em>, fast but has more space complexity). Prioritizig Offers</strong> :
Markov Chain can be used to prioritize next states. it stores connection probabilities which leads to more accurate results. <strong>Long short term memory (LSTM )</strong> :
there are so many useful Machine Learning and Deep Learning strategies. <strong>Transformers</strong> :
The last but not least, I recommend Transformer models. currently they are game changers.

To compile .cs from .Net Applications, use the CSharpCodeProvider.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
As Franci has pointed out, the CSharpCodeProvider is what you want. While writing my C# book I built "Snippy" which is a quick'n'dirty way of building and running snippets of C# - it's a simple enough project to make it quite easy to see how to use CSharpCodeProvider. The full source is available - take a look.

There are two ways to handle confirmations in WCF: return a value indicating success or failure, or use a one-way service call with a duplex service and a callback contract to notify the client of failure.

Extractive summary:
There's 2 ways you could do this - return a value from your wcf call indicating success or failure, or assume success and use a callback to tell the client if there's a problem.

Ground truth:
There's 2 ways you could do this - return a value from your wcf call indicating success or failure, or assume success and use a callback to tell the client if there's a problem. My preference would be to use a one-way service call with a duplex service and use a callback contract for the service to notify the client of a failure. I think you get a nicer, more asynchronous architecture if you follow the second path, but for simple applications just returning success or failure may be easier.

Ground truth:
Instead of using a running counter, consider using <code>datetime of creation</code> as the changing part of your filename. This way, you don't have to store and retrieve the previous value. Using the <code>ToBinary()</code> method, you can get a numeric representation of the time.

There is a potential problem with persisting long-running workflows in a database, causing a catch-22 where the workflow cannot trigger an event to reload itself until it is reloaded. To solve this, use an external service to execute asynchronous operations, separating the workflow's responsibility for the "why" and "when" from the service's responsibility for the "how".

Extractive summary:
There is a potential problem here with regard to workflow persistence. As there they are responsible for triggering the event themselves but cannot until they are reloaded. And we have a catch 22 :-(
The proper way to do this is using an external service.

Ground truth:
There is a potential problem here with regard to workflow persistence. And we have a catch 22 :-(
The proper way to do this is using an external service. The reason is that the workflow is responsible for the big picture, IE what should be done. That way you can change the how without changing the why and when part.

Generated abstractive summary:
Commenting out Unicode sequences in PHP can be problematic when embedded in JavaScript code, as PHP interprets the comment before JavaScript generation. To work around this, use a class definition to temporarily comment out the Unicode sequence, allowing for easier searching.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This sometimes happens when needing to embed something using PHP code into Javascript, such as an integer value, and need to comment some illegal value temporarily but PHP still gives error because the PHP code is run before the JS code is generated and as treated as comment.

In Python 2.5, you can't override `reversed(...)`, but you can implement the sequence protocol by adding `__len__` and `__getitem__` to make it work. Alternatively, you can create a custom function to replace the built-in `reversed`, but this is not recommended.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Creating a custom <code>__reversed__</code> is only possible since 2.6, so you can't simply implement that and have <code>reversed</code> working in 2.5. In 2.5 and below, you can however make your custom class still working with <code>reversed</code> by implementing the sequence protocol (i.e. implement both <code>__len__</code> and <code>__getitem__</code>). However, I wouldn't recommend that as it changes the normal behaviour of built-in functions (obviously) and might confuse other users.. So you should rather implement the sequnce protocol to make <code>reversed</code> working.

Generated abstractive summary:
To design a 9-key keyboard layout similar to the QWERTY keyboard, the keyboard input routine should handle key presses and releases, manage cursor placement, and advance to the next position after a short delay or when the enter key is pressed.

Extractive summary:
If no key is pushed for a second or so, advance the cursor to the next position.

Ground truth:
To do a really good design, you'll need a keyboard input routine which can tell when keys have been held for awhile, and when they have been released for awhile. For a short time after a digit is pressed, you should keep the cursor on the newly-typed character; if the same digit is pushed again, you should change the newly-typed character. If another digit is typed, make the selected digit 'permanent' and show the cursor on the character for the new key. If no key is pushed for a second or so, advance the cursor to the next position. If enter is pushed when the cursor is on a newly-typed digit, just advance the cursor.

Recursion in a web spider is not recommended due to the risk of exceeding the call stack limit, leading to a stack overflow error, even with a relatively small number of recursive calls.

Extractive summary:

To fix predeclaration in C++, declare the array as a static member in the class declaration and define it in the implementation file.

Extractive summary:
separately as a static member of the class:

Ground truth:
GCC is right, this is not standard-compliant C++ code (seeing as even a for loop variable "i" is not redeclared sometimes). PS
However, I'd mention that the design of the class is questionable. A class should encapsulate some single responsibility and should not manipulate collections of itself, this functionality belongs to outside of the class.

Avoid using uncommon Haskell extensions like `ParallelListComp`, `TypeFamilies`, and `FunctionalDependencies` as they can decrease code readability. Consider using alternative approaches like `zip` or refactor the code instead.

Extractive summary:
Examples for those would be <code>ParallelListComp</code>, <code>TypeFamilies</code>, <code>FunctionalDependencies</code>.

Ground truth:
So in addition to portability, you should consider readability too. Usage of uncommon extensions may make your code more difficult to read (for people who are unfamiliar with the extensions). In this case, I would recommend to try to avoid these extensions unless they bring a benefit. Haskell 2010 is due to be released in late 2009. The set of changes to be incorporated will be announced at the Haskell Symposium, September 3 2009.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You can safely avoid anything that creates confusion. The only place i use @ is with strings. From MSDN:
The advantage of @-quoting is that escape sequences are not processed, which makes it easy to write, for example, a fully qualified file name:
<code>@"c:\Docs\Source\a.txt"  // rather than "c:\\Docs\\Source\\a.txt"</code>

To improve the performance of a custom form shape that is slow to load, store the region on disk. This can be achieved by serializing the GraphicsPath object, which is not directly serializable, and storing it in a file. The GraphicsPath can then be recreated from the serialized data when the form loads.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The region object can't be directly serialized as it isn't marked with Serializable. However, you can easily serialize it anyways The method shown below will probably be enough for you and shows the idea but it would make more sense in production code to save <code>region.dat</code> as a resource and compile it with your application.

Passing SQL Server connections around is discouraged due to their resource cost and limited availability. Instead, use the 'using' statement to ensure timely disposal of connections, typically by wrapping the connection and command execution within a 'using' block.

Extractive summary:
It is a bad idea to pass SqlConnections around. partly because they are a relatively expensive resource and you may have a limited number of them available.

Ground truth:
It is a bad idea to pass SqlConnections around. You should also use the using statement to ensure SqlConnections are disposed in a timely fashion, when you no longer need them.

It is not possible to pass complex objects via URL. A simpler approach is to pass a string representing the property name to sort by, or consider alternative solutions like using a library for sorting tables, such as sorttable.

Extractive summary:
As far as I know you can't pass complex objects via URL. You can pass for example string with name of property. However if you want to just sort table maybe you should think about another approach to this problem.

Question: Querying values in multiple databases
Answer: 

To query multiple databases efficiently, consider using SQL Adapters (ADO.Net) for speed or LINQ for cleaner and quicker code. If performance issues persist, check for slow databases, complex queries, or external factors like network latency and hardware limitations.

Extractive summary:
It's possible that the databases that you're querying against are slow (shared hosting, network latency, number of executions, hardware on the server, and other issues).

Ground truth:
From speed tests that have been done, using SQL Adapters (ADO.Net) is the fastest way to get your information. However, considering you're on .Net, I'd recommend using LINQ if possible - it's much much cleaner and quicker to work with. That being said, unless your queries are massive, what you're using should be extremely fast.

The problem is caused by using 'pageinit' instead of 'document.ready' and the element '#mowingmaster' must exist when the script is run to bind events.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This is the first time I have used pageinit instead of document.ready document.ready is used differently – you normally use that to just start executing code when the document is ready, and then you bind your events within that code. Please look at the docs for pageinit:

iOS7 compatibility with App on iPad: The issue is with the 'width=device-width' viewport setting returning 768 instead of 320 in iOS7, causing compatibility mode problems. To fix, edit the viewport on the remote page, or use one of the following native solutions: build as a Universal app, or use JavaScript to decrease the scale.

Extractive summary:
<strong>Fixing natively:</strong> 
Few options...
1) Build the app as 'Universal' 
2) I found <em>somewhat passable</em> results by executing javascript on webViewDidFinishLoad to decrease the scale

Just updating my answer based on what we've found last week and implemented for our app as a solution. Although not entirely clear I believe the Question in hand above has to do with an HTML application running in webview vs. a web application in safari. <strong>Issue:</strong>
Is not due to media Query but the viewport <strong>width=device-width</strong> is returning 768 instead of the 320 it returned in &lt;= iOS6.x, when running an iPhone application in 'Compatibility Mode' on an iPad. Fixing on the remote page</strong>
The best solution is to edit the viewport on the remote page by modifying the value of the 'width' attribute or removing it all together. <strong>Fixing natively:</strong>

When opening a UTF-8 file with the `codecs` module, its contents are automatically decoded into Unicode strings, so no additional decoding is necessary. To write a file, use Unicode literals or the `codecs` module with the specified encoding.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
When opening a UTF-8 file with the <code>codecs</code> module, as you did, the contents of the file are automatically decoded into Unicode strings, so you must not try to decode them again. The same is true when writing the file; if you write it using the <code>codecs</code> module, the Unicode string you're passing will automatically be encoded to whatever encoding you specified. If the application doesn't recognize the UTF-8 file, it might help saving it with a BOM (Byte Order Mark) (which is generally discouraged, but if the application can't recognize a UTF-8 file otherwise, it's worth a try):

Ground truth:
You can't set the foreground of an image. The color of the image is imbedded in the png file. What you could do is create a filter and put it over a colored backgroud. If you want the book to be blue (foreground) you first create a filter with a white background and a transparant foreground. If you have to support both black and white theme's you'll need to creat a filter with a black background and a transparant foreground as well.

MySQL Workbench offers the option to review the generated SQL script before sending it to the server. The DELIMITER command is necessary to switch the current delimiter, but is not required in MySQL Workbench's object editors.

Extractive summary:
1) MySQL Workbench offers the option to review the generated SQL script before it is sent to the server.

Ground truth:
1) MySQL Workbench offers the option to review the generated SQL script before it is sent to the server. The <code>DELIMITER</code> command is usually necessary to switch the current delimiter that ends a single statement (which is by default a semicolon) to something else because the stored procedure code itself needs the semicolon to separate individual commands. However the sp code must be sent as a whole to the server. A few more details: the <code>DELIMITER</code> keywword is a client keyword only, that means the server doesn't know it and doesn't need it. It's an invention for clients to properly separate sql commands before sending them to the server (you cannot send a list of commands to a server, only individual statements). This might disappear in future version but for now just ignore it.

Ground truth:
Using the $1 will work, however be aware that you should probably use quotation marks when passing a number like 003 in stead of 3 as in some cases the two zeros in front might be dropped. Also I recommend wrapping the string in quotation marks as well, avoiding accidental command calls.

Filtering involves finding potential matches and then applying a sequential algorithm.

Extractive summary:
Autocomplete is usually implemented using one of the following: one can execute very fast searches at the expense of memory storage. Find a set of potential matches and then apply a sequential algorithm to check each candidate.

Ground truth:
Autocomplete is usually implemented using one of the following: one can execute very fast searches at the expense of memory storage. The tree traversal can be adapted for approximate matching. By partitioning the text into tokens (ngrams) one can execute searches for pattern occurrences using a simple hashing scheme. Find a set of potential matches and then apply a sequential algorithm to check each candidate.

DateTime microseconds always returns 0 due to overlapping issues when combining timestamps. To resolve this, use DateTime::createFromFormat() with 'U.u' format or a custom function like udate() that formats the timestamp to include microseconds before creating a DateTime object.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Some answers make use of several timestamps, which is conceptually wrong, and overlapping issues may occur: seconds from <code>21:15:05.999</code> combined by microseconds from <code>21:15:06.000</code> give <code>21:15:05.000</code>. Apparently the simplest is to use <code>DateTime::createFromFormat()</code> with <code>U.u</code>, but as stated in a comment, it fails if there are no microseconds. So, I'm suggesting this code:

Ground truth:
To achieve the desired result in Access, I would try to un-pivot the first table and get the min and max of each agency as such: I might save this query as "MinMaxAgencyQuery" and then use it to create my "Letter Type" column. If I needed to do this all in the same query, I would substitute my first query in each of the three unioned queries like so: You never specified what becomes of account#'s that have no values for Agency1, Agency2, and Agency3, and so they would not be shown given this solution.

Ground truth:
This implementation is not the Factory because it doesn't create new instances. It isn't Service Locator either, because it is not locating services - now this requires a few words of explanation.

The user encountered a "No such file or directory" error when trying to launch a Django server with gunicorn on an Ubuntu 20.04 server. The issue was caused by the shebang in the Python scripts in the virtual environment directory pointing to a different Python interpreter than the one on the production server. To fix the issue, the user ran gunicorn using the Python interpreter directly: `python3 env/bin/gunicorn`.

Extractive summary:
For future readers, I had this issue when trying to launch a Django server using gunicorn. It was just Python scripts with a shebang of the path to the Python interpreter on the build machine. I was able to fix this problem by starting gunicorn using <code>python3 env/bin/gunicorn</code> instead of <code>env/bin/gunicorn</code>.

Ground truth:
For future readers, I had this issue when trying to launch a Django server using gunicorn. I was using AWS CodeBuild to build the virtual environment and run tests and using CodeDeploy to put the built artifacts onto the production server and launch the new version (all environments were Ubuntu 20.04). To be more specific, all of the files in <code>env/bin</code> had the shebang <code>#!/codebuild/output/src715682316/src/env/bin/python</code>, so of course running <code>env/bin/gunicorn</code> on the production server would fail. I was able to fix this problem by starting gunicorn using <code>python3 env/bin/gunicorn</code> instead of <code>env/bin/gunicorn</code>.

The `TryElementAtOrDefault` method checks if an element at a given index exists in an enumerable collection, returning the element and a boolean indicating success.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The issue the OP is trying to get at is that <code>Count()</code> will have to use the enumerator to <code>MoveNext()</code> through the whole <code>IEnumerator</code> collection. The benefit of IEnumerable is that we should be able to stop enumerating when we reach some predicate of known information. The problem I pointed out with the other answers is that <code>null</code> is a valid value in any collection. null</code> isn't reliable.

To render an Angular directive in a popup window and allow it to communicate with the main window, two possible approaches are:

1. Load the app in the new window, which is similar to opening it in a new tab, and use cache headers to prevent unnecessary file downloads.
2. Create a second top-level module that includes only the necessary components, but this requires additional work and additional file downloads for the user.

Extractive summary:
The correct way to handle this situatin it to load the app in the new window. An alternative would be to create a second top level module that pulling in only the components you need but again this is a lot of ectra work on your end and your users would need to download additional files.

Ground truth:
The correct way to handle this situatin it to load the app in the new window. This would be no different than someone doing a right-click open in new window.

To add margin between buttons, consider using Bootstrap's grid system and CSS to override default behaviors. You can use the `margin` property in CSS to add space between buttons.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You are apparently using Bootstrap so after removing all your CSS and just using basic bootstrap markup, buttons are evenly spaced. But Buttons are inline elements, if they are not being laid out correctly it's due to your combination of html/css overriding default behaviors. Also, keep in mind that the bootstrap <code>xs</code> grid classes (  <code>col-xs-*</code> ) keeps things horizontal at all times regardless of media size.

The issue with the modified ZeroMQ multi-threaded example was a misunderstanding of the code's purpose, which is a server-only application with a REP socket, waiting for client requests. The "hang" was normal behavior, and the code was correct all along. The solution involved adding a client to send requests to the server, making the code work as expected.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
About the hanging that I saw in my <strong>UPDATED</strong> question, I finally figured out what's going on. It's a false expectation on my part. So the "hang" that I was seeing is completely normal! As soon as I hook up a client app to it, things start rolling instantly. So to be fair the lack of visual cue and the compiler deprecation warning caused me to question the sample code as a new user, but the story that the code tells is valid. But all of a sudden all @user3666197 says in his answer starts to make sense.

There are two issues with the provided React code. 

1. The `filterGender` function uses `indexOf` to compare the gender, which is inefficient. Instead, it should directly compare the gender using `===`.
2. The `filterAge` function is filtering records from the same `this.state.list` variable it's trying to update, causing unexpected behavior. To fix this, a separate `this.list` variable should be defined in the constructor and used to filter records.

To align text in Illustrator CS5, select the text field and adjust its alignment to "justify (all characters)" or use alternative methods by adjusting tracking in the character panel or splitting the text field and distributing it equally using the align panel.

Extractive summary:
Or you can split the text field into one for each character and distribute that equally using the align panel.

Ground truth:
When you create a text field, you can set its adjustment to "justify (all characters)" (you have to expand the paragraph panel for that, it's the most right adjustment). Then the text you enter is automatically distributed. Otherwise, you can also emulate that behaviour in one of these two ways: You can either change the distance between the character manually by increasing the tracking in the character panel (I don't know its correct english name); it's the control with the "A V" and the arrow below. Or you can split the text field into one for each character and distribute that equally using the align panel.

The MMORPG Ryzom was open sourced a few days ago (blog post). While I'm not that well versed in game programming, paroneayea's comment on reddit makes me think it's worth a look:

It's hard to understate how big of a release this is. The fact that anyone can run their own MMORPG server, or contribute back useful assets to make it into the main server! Honestly I don't think I've been this excited about the freeing of a project since Blender was released as free and open source software nearly a decade ago.

To select records that sum to a target value in MySQL, you can use a JOIN statement to combine rows from the same table, but this approach has limitations. A more suitable solution involves retrieving all rows and calculating the sum programmatically. Alternatively, you can use a running total approach or sort the records by a specific date field and process them sequentially to achieve the desired result.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
This type of solution will only work if your expecting that you only need two rows ever to equal your target sum. Since this is most likely not the case, your best bet is probably to try and get all of the rows and do this programaticly on the returned data. Based on the updated information from this request, I have an alternate answer.

To clarify the $data findAll query in CakePHP, it involves linking models with a foreign key and using associations like HABTM or belongsTo, and the recursive property can affect the depth of model relations.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
Supernovah -
Please clarify one thing for me: you write that you want to only have values put into $data when table1.id is found in table2.sub_id. I think Beau is right -- if you have the models correctly linked, using a HABTM or belongsTo, etc., variable, the findAll should automatically pull the associated records from table2. If you have changed the value of the recursive property in your code, it would alter how deep the model relations are allowed to go on a given query.

Generated abstractive summary:
To manage bidirectional associations and inverse updates in Java, a package-private mechanism can be used to maintain consistency between classes A and B. Class A has a reference to B and vice versa, and updates to one class trigger changes in the other, ensuring they remain linked. This implementation is mostly exception-safe but may leak in exceptional cases, and further considerations such as thread safety, many-many relationships, and performance are left for the reader to explore.

Extractive summary:
Mostly exception safe (may leak in exception case).

Ground truth:
To make sense, these calsses will be peers. I suggest a package-private mechanism (in the absense of friend) to keep consistency. Thread safety, many-many, performance, libraryisation, etc., is left as an exercise to the interested reader.

Generated abstractive summary:
Unless you abstract out the setters, you'll need an event notification mechanism, such as PropertyChangeSupport for JavaBeans. Glazed Lists' ObservableElementList can handle association synchronization from the list end, and you can use property change monitoring for the other direction. A generic solution is not feasible without a special list implementation in the B class, but a foundation for one can be built. This is a complex problem, similar to the "holy grail" of data binding.

Extractive summary:
Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism. If your objects are JavaBeans, then you are looking at using PropertyChangeSupport and firing property change events. The other direction is easily handled using property change monitoring (or equivalent). Note that something like this would <em>require</em> a special list implementation in the B class - no way short of AOP type solutions that you could handle it in the general case (i.e. using ArrayList or something like that).

Ground truth:
Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism. If your objects are JavaBeans, then you are looking at using PropertyChangeSupport and firing property change events. If you do that (or have some other mechanism for detecting changes), then Glazed Lists provides an ObservableElementList that could easily be used to handle the association synchronization from the list end (i.e. adding A to List&lt; A&gt; automatically calls a.setB(b)). I realize that this isn't a generic solution, but it seems like it would be an easy foundation for one. We use both techniques in concert with each other in almost all of our applications, but have never tried to go quite as abstract as what you are asking about. With the above in place, it would be possible to have a number of pre-defined Connectors and Synchronizers that meet different binding criteria.

To restrict which tabs are selectable in a UITabBarController, set its delegate and implement the `tabBarController:shouldSelectViewController:` and `tabBarController:didSelectViewController:` methods to return valid values based on the user's log in status.

Extractive summary:
In the delegate, you should implement these two methods:
– tabBarController:shouldSelectViewController:
– tabBarController:didSelectViewController:
Returning valid values depending on log in status.

Ground truth:
Restricting which tabs are selectable, is achieved by setting a delegate of the UITabBarController (i.e. one that conforms to UITabBarControllerDelegate). In the delegate, you should implement these two methods:
– tabBarController:shouldSelectViewController:
– tabBarController:didSelectViewController:
Returning valid values depending on log in status.

To write multiple "if" statements in a batch file, follow these key rules: 

- The "if" command does not use the "then" word.
- The "do" word is used with the "for" command, not "if".
- Commands following an "if" statement must be in the same line or enclosed in parentheses.
- Multiple conditions cannot be combined with AND or OR, but nested "if" statements can be used.
- To combine multiple conditions, a trick with the "and" variable can be used, but this is equivalent to multiple individual "if" statements.

You could try something along these lines: The "sed" command removes the header line (line 1), and all spaces from alexa_products.csv. Then the remainder of the file is sorted using "sort" and saved as file "a". Likewise, file "data_products" has its header and spaces removed, gets sorted and stored in file "b". Then "join" uses field 1 of file "a" and matches it with field "2" in file b and prints where they match.

But as you said in comment, you didn't see a <em>repetitive structure</em> when trying to debug, then the problem possibly resides in the place where you use the <code>DataTemplate</code>.

MongoDB cannot sort by arbitrary query string values.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The database (MongoDB) can not sort by arbitrary value, so you will have to do this in your application. This is a very specific type of sorting, and I doubt you would fine any database that can do this—except for perhaps SQLite where you can call out into your (scripting) language to set your sorting comparison function.

To query the user_meta table to find a user's email in the wp_users table, use the following SQL queries:

1. Find the user ID by matching the meta key and value in the wp_usermeta table.
2. Use the user ID to retrieve the user's email from the wp_users table.

To open a new window in JavaScript, use `window.open(url, '', 'width=1000,height=700')`. When providing a relative URL, it will be resolved relative to the current URL, potentially resulting in a 404 error or redirect loop if the resulting URL is not found or redirects to the original page.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
You should provide the full url when possible, else it tries to use the relative url. <code>var printWindow = window.open('', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> would open a blank url
<code>var printWindow = window.open('print.aspx', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> opens page <em>print.aspx</em> relative to current url. So if current url is <em>www.google.com</em>, it opens <em>www.google.com/print.aspx</em>, which would be 404 page not found. For example if you run this on current stackoverflow page it would open this page itself because <em><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18633800/xxxxxx/print.aspx</code></em> would redirect to <em><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18633800/xxxxxx</code></em>
Also the jquery wont work because you cannot copy content from one window to another through javascript.

To send a custom message to one friend using the iOS Facebook Graph API, set up an XMPP server on your server and use their XMPP login, which can be obtained by requesting the "xmpp_login" permission.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
The way to do this is to set up a simple XMPP server on your server and send it using their XMPP login which you can get with the following code snippet. There are some nice frameworks that make XMPP really easy to implement on a simple level, such as SleekXMPP for python/django. It's definitely a little work to do this, but probably much more effective.

Null pointer exception occurs when accessing a resource (in this case, "highScores.DAT") outside of the IDE, due to the src folder not being present in the deployed application. To resolve this, use a relative or absolute path to access the resource, or consider using the Preferences API for persistent storage.

Extractive summary:
Your code refers to a src folder which ought to be not present anymore, if your code is deployed. But for things like highscores you should consider the Preferences API instead which gives you a persistent storage independent from your application’s location.

Ground truth:
Your code refers to a src folder which ought to be not present anymore, if your code is deployed. But if you deploy your application you have to care that the file is packaged with it. Note that the NullPointerException comes naturally as you are catching the IOException and then proceeding as nothing has happened with an uninitialized Reader. You should rather ensure the code dealing with the resource is not executed when the allocation fails. But for things like highscores you should consider the Preferences API instead which gives you a persistent storage independent from your application’s location.

The `DragDropEffect.Copy` property resets to `None` because it's not allowed in the `AllowedEffects` property enumeration. To use `Copy`, set the `DragDropEffects` enumeration when calling `DoDragDrop` or in the `BeginDragDrop` method.

Extractive summary:


Ground truth:
What is the <code>(DragEventArgs).AllowedEffects</code> property value? You can only set the <code>(DragEventArgs).Effects</code> property to one of the values specified by the <code>(DragEventArgs).AllowedEffects</code> property. Copy</code> is not an option found in the <code>(DragEventArgs).AllowedEffects</code> property enumeration, then you will <em>not</em> be able to use that function. UPDATE &gt;&gt;&gt;
As I said, normally, you set the allowable <code>DragDropEffects</code> enumeration when you call <code>DoDragDrop</code>... I'm guessing that the last parameter here is where you set the <code>DragDropEffects</code> allowable effect enumeration.

To sort a string alphabetically and get the position number in Java, two approaches can be used:

1.  **Using ASCII values**: A function can be implemented to sort the characters in the string by comparing their ASCII values. This involves iterating through the string and swapping characters if they are in the wrong order.
2.  **Using alphabet mapping**: Another approach is to map each character in the string to its corresponding position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26). Then, print the characters in the sorted order based on their alphabetical positions.
