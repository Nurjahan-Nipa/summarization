2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View). In some cases the model can also be used to turn a data source into a higher level abstraction as well. A good example of this is the MVC Storefront project. There is a discussion here regarding the differences between MVC vs MVP. The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view. Having said that, ASP.NET MVC is by these definitions an MVP framework because the Controller accesses the Model to populate the View which is meant to have no logic (just  displays the variables provided by the Controller). To perhaps get an idea of the ASP.NET MVC distinction from MVP, check out this MIX presentation by Scott Hanselman.","Both MVP and MVC frameworks separate concerns into three main parts: model (data source), controller/application logic (Presenter), and display code (View). The main difference is that MVC typically has the View and Controller interact directly with the Model, whereas MVP has the Presenter interact with both the Model and View.",,"Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View).

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Wikipedia Article. To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. Instead of your program explicitly controlling everything, your program sets up a class or library with certain functions to be called when certain things happen. It solves code duplication. For example, in the old days you would manually write your own event loop, polling the system libraries for new events. Nowadays, most modern APIs you simply tell the system libraries what events you're interested in, and it will let you know when they happen. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control. Inversion of control is made easy in many languages through the concept of delegates, interfaces, or even raw function pointers. It is not appropriate to use in all cases, because the flow of a program can be harder to follow when written this way. It's a useful way to design methods when writing a library that will be reused, but it should be used sparingly in the core of your own program unless it really solves a code duplication problem.","Inversion of Control is a programming technique that turns sequential code into a delegation structure, reducing code duplication by allowing the program to set up functions to be called when certain events occur, rather than manually controlling everything.",,"To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Inversion of Control is what you get when your program callbacks, e.g. like a gui program. For example, in an old school menu, you might have: thereby controlling the flow of user interaction. In a GUI program or somesuch, instead we say So now control is inverted... instead of the computer accepting user input in a fixed order, the user controls the order in which the data is entered, and when the data is saved in the database. Basically, anything with an event loop, callbacks, or execute triggers falls into this category.","Inversion of Control is a design pattern where the user controls the flow of interaction, rather than the program following a fixed sequence, often seen in GUI programs with event loops and callbacks.",,"Inversion of Control is what you get when your program callbacks, e.g. Basically, anything with an event loop, callbacks, or execute triggers falls into this category."
3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"The Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) patterns are all about removing dependencies from your code. For example, say your application has a text editor component and you want to provide spell checking. Your standard code would look something like this: What we've done here creates a dependency between the <code>TextEditor</code> and the <code>SpellChecker</code>. In an IoC scenario we would instead do something like this: In the first code example we are instantiating <code>SpellChecker</code> (<code>this.checker = new SpellChecker();</code>), which means the <code>TextEditor</code> class directly depends on the <code>SpellChecker</code> class. In the second code example we are creating an abstraction by having the <code>SpellChecker</code> dependency class in <code>TextEditor</code> constructor signature (not initializing dependency in class). This allows us to call the dependency then pass it to the TextEditor class like so: Now the client creating the <code>TextEditor</code> class has the control over which <code>SpellChecker</code> implementation to use because we're injecting the dependency to the <code>TextEditor</code> signature. This is just a simple example, there's a good series of articles by Simone Busoli that explains it in greater detail.","Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) patterns remove dependencies from code by injecting them, allowing for more flexibility and control over class dependencies.",,The Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) patterns are all about removing dependencies from your code.
9,How do I calculate someone's age in C#?,"This is the version we use here. It works, and it's fairly simple. It's the same idea as Jeff's but I think it's a little clearer because it separates out the logic for subtracting one, so it's a little easier to understand. You could expand the ternary operator to make it even clearer, if you think that sort of thing is unclear. Obviously this is done as an extension method on <code>DateTime</code>, but clearly you can grab that one line of code that does the work and put it anywhere. Here we have another overload of the Extension method that passes in <code>DateTime.Now</code>, just for completeness.","This is a simple version of an age calculator, separating logic for subtracting one year.",,This is the version we use here.
3881,IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?,"If it's a <code>setter</code> method and <code>null</code> is being passed to it, I think it would make more sense to throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"But I think you have to be very careful with it. If you will overuse this pattern, you will make very complicated design and even more complicated code.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"MVP: the view is in charge. The view, in most cases, creates its presenter. The presenter will interact with the model and manipulate the view through an interface. The view will sometimes interact with the presenter, usually through some interface. This comes down to implementation; do you want the view to call methods on the presenter or do you want the view to have events the presenter listens to? It boils down to this: The view knows about the presenter. The view delegates to the presenter. MVC: the controller is in charge. The controller is created or accessed based on some event/request. The controller then creates the appropriate view and interacts with the model to further configure the view. It boils down to: the controller creates and manages the view; the view is slave to the controller. The view does not know about the controller.","MVP: View is in charge, View knows and delegates to Presenter. MVC: Controller is in charge, Controller creates and manages the View.",,MVP: the view is in charge. MVC: the controller is in charge.
2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Also worth remembering is that there are different types of MVPs as well. Fowler has broken the pattern into two - Passive View and Supervising Controller. When using Passive View, your View typically implement a fine-grained interface with properties mapping more or less directly to the underlaying UI widget. For instance, you might have a ICustomerView with properties like Name and Address. Your implementation might look something like this: Your Presenter class will talk to the model and ""map"" it to the view. This approach is called the ""Passive View"". The benefit is that the view is easy to test, and it is easier to move between UI platforms (Web, Windows/XAML, etc.). The disadvantage is that you can't leverage things like databinding (which is really powerful in frameworks like WPF and Silverlight). The second flavor of MVP is the Supervising Controller. In that case your View might have a property called Customer, which then again is databound to the UI widgets. You don't have to think about synchronizing and micro-manage the view, and the Supervising Controller can step in and help when needed, for instance with compled interaction logic. The third ""flavor"" of MVP (or someone would perhaps call it a separate pattern) is the Presentation Model (or sometimes referred to Model-View-ViewModel). Compared to the MVP you ""merge"" the M and the P into one class. You have your customer object which your UI widgets is data bound to, but you also have additional UI-spesific fields like ""IsButtonEnabled"", or ""IsReadOnly"", etc. I think the best resource I've found to UI architecture is the series of blog posts done by Jeremy Miller over at The Build Your Own CAB Series Table of Contents. He covered all the flavors of MVP and showed C# code to implement them. I have also blogged about the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in the context of Silverlight over at YouCard Re-visited: Implementing the ViewModel pattern.","MVP and MVC are software design patterns. MVP has two sub-patterns: Passive View and Supervising Controller. Passive View has a fine-grained interface, making views easy to test but limiting databinding. Supervising Controller uses databinding and leverages interaction logic. The Presentation Model (Model-View-ViewModel) combines the model and presenter into one class, adding UI-specific fields.",,
3881,IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?,"I tend to follow the design of JDK libraries, especially Collections and Concurrency (Joshua Bloch, Doug Lea, those guys know how to design solid APIs). Anyway, many APIs in the JDK pro-actively throws <code>NullPointerException</code>. For example, the Javadoc for <code>Map.containsKey</code> states: @throws NullPointerException if the key is null and this map     does not permit null keys (optional). It's perfectly valid to throw your own NPE. The convention is to include the parameter name which was null in the message of the exception. The pattern goes: Whatever you do, don't allow a bad value to get set and throw an exception later when other code attempts to use it. That makes debugging a nightmare. You should always the follow the ""fail-fast"" principle.","Throw a NullPointerException with the parameter name in the message, following the ""fail-fast"" principle.",,It's perfectly valid to throw your own NPE.

6414,C# loop - break vs. continue,"There are more than a few people who don't like <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>. The latest complaint I saw about them was in <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em> by Douglas Crockford. But I find that sometimes using one of them really simplifies things, especially if your language doesn't include a <code>do-while</code> or <code>do-until</code> style of loop. I tend to use <code>break</code> in loops that are searching a list for something. Once found, there's no point in continuing, so you might as well quit. I use <code>continue</code> when doing something with most elements of a list, but still want to skip over a few. The <code>break</code> statement also comes in handy when polling for a valid response from somebody or something. Instead of: You could eliminate some duplication and use: The <code>do-until</code> loop that I mentioned before is the more elegant solution for that particular problem: No duplication, and no <code>break</code> needed either.","The author prefers using `break` to quit a loop when a condition is met, and `continue` to skip over certain elements in a list.

PS: My memory is a bit hazy on this so apologies if I'm wrong instead of break/continue, it has break/next, which behave the same in terms of loops Loops (like everything else) are expressions, and ""return"" the last thing that they did.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"MVP is not necessarily a scenario where the View is in charge (see Taligent's MVP for example). I find it unfortunate that people are still preaching this as a pattern (View in charge) as opposed to an anti-pattern as it contradicts ""It's just a view"" (Pragmatic Programmer). ""It's just a view"" states that the final view shown to the user is a secondary concern of the application. Microsoft's MVP pattern renders re-use of Views much more difficult and conveniently excuses Microsoft's designer from encouraging bad practice. To be perfectly frank, I think the underlying concerns of MVC hold true for any MVP implementation and the differences are almost entirely semantic. As long as you are following separation of concerns between the view (that displays the data), the controller (that initialises and controls user interaction) and the model (the underlying data and/or services)) then you are acheiving the benefits of MVC. If you are acheiving the benefits then who really cares whether your pattern is MVC, MVP or Supervising Controller? The only real pattern remains as MVC, the rest are just differing flavours of it. Consider this highly exciting article that comprehensively lists a number of these differing implementations. You may note that they're all basically doing the same thing but slightly differently. I personally think MVP has only been recently re-introduced as a catchy term to either reduce arguments between semantic bigots who argue whether something is truly MVC or not or to justify Microsofts Rapid Application Development tools. Neither of these reasons in my books justify its existence as a separate design pattern.","MVP and MVC are patterns with similar underlying concerns: separation of concerns between view, controller, and model. The main difference is semantic, and as long as you follow the MVC principles, the specific pattern (MVC, MVP, Supervising Controller) is less important.",,"To be perfectly frank, I think the underlying concerns of MVC hold true for any MVP implementation and the differences are almost entirely semantic."
27581,What issues should be considered when overriding equals and hashCode in Java?,"The theory (for the language lawyers and the mathematically inclined): <code>equals()</code> (javadoc) must define an equivalence relation (it must be <em>reflexive</em>, <em>symmetric</em>, and <em>transitive</em>).

Furthermore, <code>o.equals(null)</code> must always return false. <code>hashCode()</code> (javadoc) must also be <em>consistent</em> (if the object is not modified in terms of <code>equals()</code>, it must keep returning the same value). The <strong>relation</strong> between the two methods is: <em>Whenever <code>a.equals(b)</code>, then <code>a.hashCode()</code> must be same as <code>b.hashCode()</code>.</em> In practice: If you override one, then you should override the other. Use the same set of fields that you use to compute <code>equals()</code> to compute <code>hashCode()</code>. Use the excellent helper classes EqualsBuilder and HashCodeBuilder from the Apache Commons Lang library. An example: Also remember: When using a hash-based Collection or Map such as HashSet, LinkedHashSet, HashMap, Hashtable, or WeakHashMap, make sure that the hashCode() of the key objects that you put into the collection never changes while the object is in the collection. The bulletproof way to ensure this is to make your keys immutable, which has also other benefits.","When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the following:

34510,What is a race condition?,"A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are ""racing"" to access/change the data. Problems often occur when one thread does a ""check-then-act"" (e.g. ""check"" if the value is X, then ""act"" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the ""check"" and the ""act"". E.g: The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing. In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time. This would mean something like this:","A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data simultaneously, causing unpredictable results due to thread scheduling. It's often prevented by locking shared data to ensure only one thread can access it at a time.",,"A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time.

34510,What is a race condition?,"Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems. A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do. This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access. There's almost always a race condition when one thread calls sleep to give another thread time to finish a task (unless that sleep is in a loop, with some checking mechanism). Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals. Mutexes are good when you want to make sure you're the only one doing something. Signals are good when you want to make sure someone else has finished doing something. Minimizing shared resources can also help prevent unexpected behaviors Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs. Code which relies heavily on sleeps is prone to race conditions, so first check for calls to sleep in the affected code. Adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events. This can be useful for reproducing the behavior, seeing if you can make it disappear by changing the timing of things, and for testing solutions put in place. The sleeps should be removed after debugging. The signature sign that one has a race condition though, is if there's an issue that only occurs intermittently on some machines. Common bugs would be crashes and deadlocks. With logging, you should be able to find the affected area and work back from there.","A race condition occurs in multi-threaded applications, where an assumption about the order of events between threads or processes leads to unexpected behavior.

34510,What is a race condition?,"A ""race condition"" exists when multithreaded (or otherwise parallel) code that would access a shared resource could do so in such a way as to cause unexpected results. Take this example: If you had 5 threads executing this code at once, the value of x WOULD NOT end up being 50,000,000. It would in fact vary with each run. This is because, in order for each thread to increment the value of x, they have to do the following: (simplified, obviously) Any thread can be at any step in this process at any time, and they can step on each other when a shared resource is involved. The state of x can be changed by another thread during the time between x is being read and when it is written back. Let's say a thread retrieves the value of x, but hasn't stored it yet. Another thread can also retrieve the same value of x (because no thread has changed it yet) and then they would both be storing the same value (x+1) back in x! Example: Race conditions can be avoided by employing some sort of locking mechanism before the code that accesses the shared resource: Here, the answer comes out as 50,000,000 every time. For more on locking, search for: mutex, semaphore, critical section, shared resource.","A ""race condition"" occurs when multithreaded code accessing a shared resource can cause unexpected results due to threads interfering with each other's operations.

More formally, it is used by the compiler to generate code for an <em>iterator</em>. Iterators are functions that return <code>IEnumerable</code> objects.

39476,What is the yield keyword used for in C#?,"The yield keyword actually does quite a lot here. The function returns an object that implements the IEnumerable interface. If a calling function starts foreach-ing over this object the function is called again until it ""yields"". This is syntactic sugar introduced in C# 2.0. In earlier versions you had to create your own IEnumerable and IEnumerator objects to do stuff like this. The easiest way understand code like this is to type in an example, set some breakpoints and see what happens. Try stepping through this for example: BIGBLOCK When you step through the example you'll find the first call to Integers() returns 1. The second call returns 2 and the line ""yield return 1"" is not executed again.

27581,What issues should be considered when overriding equals and hashCode in Java?,One gotcha I have found is where two objects contain references to each other (one example being a parent/child relationship with a convenience method on the parent to get all children). These sorts of things are fairly common when doing Hibernate mappings for example. If you include both ends of the relationship in your hashCode or equals tests it's possible to get into a recursive loop which ends in a StackOverflowException. The simplest solution is to not include the getChildren collection in the methods.,"One gotcha is including self-referential objects (e.g. parent/child relationships) in equals and hashCode, which can cause a StackOverflowException.",If you include both ends of the relationship in your hashCode or equals tests it's possible to get into a recursive loop which ends in a StackOverflowException.,If you include both ends of the relationship in your hashCode or equals tests it's possible to get into a recursive loop which ends in a StackOverflowException.

3881,IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?,"You should be using <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> (IAE), not <code>NullPointerException</code> (NPE) for the following reasons: First, the NPE JavaDoc explicitly lists the cases where NPE is appropriate. Notice that all of them are thrown by the runtime when <code>null</code> is used inappropriately. In contrast, the IAE JavaDoc couldn't be more clear: ""Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument."" Yup, that's you! Second, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume? Probably that someone dereferenced a <code>null</code>. When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value. Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading. Third, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead? Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE's separately from IAE and do something different as a result? Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message? But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters. Fourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent? Why is it that an illegal <code>null</code> is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments? Finally, I accept the argument given by other answers that parts of the Java API use NPE in this manner. However, the Java API is inconsistent with everything from exception types to naming conventions, so I think just blindly copying (your favorite part of) the Java API isn't a good enough argument to trump these other considerations.","Use `IllegalArgumentException` instead of `NullPointerException` to indicate an invalid or inappropriate argument, as it's more specific and consistent with Java API guidelines.",,"You should be using <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> (IAE), not <code>NullPointerException</code> (NPE) for the following reasons:"

62814,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"The answer may depend on the target OS. For example, at least one RTOS implementation I'm familiar with will allow multiple sequential ""get"" operations against a single OS mutex, so long as they're all from within the same thread context. The multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex. This differs from binary semaphores, for which only a single get is allowed at a time, regardless of thread contexts. The idea behind this type of mutex is that you protect an object by only allowing a single context to modify the data at a time. Even if the thread gets the mutex and then calls a function that further modifies the object (and gets/puts the protector mutex around its own operations), the operations should still be safe because they're all happening under a single thread. Of course, when using this feature, you must be certain that all accesses within a single thread really are safe! I'm not sure how common this approach is, or whether it applies outside of the systems with which I'm familiar. For an example of this kind of mutex, see the ThreadX RTOS.","The key difference between a binary semaphore and a mutex is that a mutex allows multiple gets (locks) from the same thread context, whereas a binary semaphore only allows a single get (lock) at a time, regardless of thread context.",,"The multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex.

75191,What is an unsigned char?,"This is implementation dependent, as the C standard does NOT define the signed-ness of <code>char</code>. Depending on the platform, char may be <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>, so you need to explicitly ask for <code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code> if your implementation depends on it. Just use <code>char</code> if you intend to represent characters from strings, as this will match what your platform puts in the string. The difference between <code>signed char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code> is as you'd expect. On most platforms, <code>signed char</code> will be an 8-bit two's complement number ranging from <code>-128</code> to <code>127</code>, and <code>unsigned char</code> will be an 8-bit unsigned integer (<code>0</code> to <code>255</code>). Note the standard does NOT require that <code>char</code> types have 8 bits, only that <code>sizeof(char)</code> return <code>1</code>. You can get at the number of bits in a char with <code>CHAR_BIT</code> in <code>limits.h</code>. There are few if any platforms today where this will be something other than <code>8</code>, though.

It is common to see an RGB (or RGBA) colour represented as 24 (or 32) bits, each an unsigned char. Since unsigned char values fall in the range [0,255], the values are typically interpreted as 0 meaning a total lack of a given colour component 255 meaning 100% of a given colour pigment So you would end up with RGB red as (255,0,0) -> (100% red, 0% green, 0% blue). Why not use a signed char? Arithmetic and bit shifting becomes problematic. As explained already, a signed char's range is essentially shifted by -128. A very simple and naive (mostly unused) method for converting RGB to grayscale is to average all three colour components, but this runs into problems when the values of the colour components are negative. Red (255, 0, 0) averages to (85, 85, 85) when using unsigned char arithmetic. However, if the values were signed chars (127,-128,-128), we would end up with (-99, -99, -99), which would be (29, 29, 29) in our unsigned char space, which is incorrect.","`unsigned char` is often used in computer graphics to represent single bytes for color components (e.g. RGB), with values ranging from 0 (no color) to 255 (100% color).

86049,How do I ignore files in Subversion?,"(This answer has been updated to match SVN 1.8 and 1.9's behaviour) You have 2 questions: Marking files as ignored: By ""ignored file"" I mean the file won't appear in lists even as ""unversioned"": your SVN client will pretend the file doesn't exist at all in the filesystem. Ignored files are specified by a ""file pattern"". The syntax and format of file patterns is explained in SVN's online documentation: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.special.ignore.html ""File Patterns in Subversion"". Subversion, as of version 1.8 (June 2013) and later, supports 3 different ways of specifying file patterns. Here's a summary with examples: 1 - Runtime Configuration Area - <code>global-ignores</code> option: This is a client-side only setting, so your <code>global-ignores</code> list won't be shared by other users, and it applies to all repos you checkout onto your computer. This setting is defined in your Runtime Configuration Area file: Windows (file-based) - <code>C:\Users\{you}\AppData\Roaming\Subversion\config</code> Windows (registry-based) - <code>Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\global-ignores</code> in both <code>HKLM</code> and <code>HKCU</code>. Linux/Unix - <code>~/.subversion/config</code> 2 - The <code>svn:ignore</code> property, which is set on directories (not files): This is stored within the repo, so other users will have the same ignore files. Similar to how <code>.gitignore</code> works. <code>svn:ignore</code> is applied to directories and is non-recursive or inherited. Any file or immediate subdirectory of the parent directory that matches the File Pattern will be excluded. While SVN 1.8 adds the concept of ""inherited properties"", the <code>svn:ignore</code> property itself is ignored in non-immediate descendant directories: (So the file <code>./subdirectory/ignoreThis</code> is not ignored, even though ""<code>ignoreThis.txt</code>"" is applied on the <code>.</code> repo root). Therefore, to apply an ignore list recursively you must use <code>svn propset svn:ignore &lt;filePattern&gt; . --recursive</code>. This will create a copy of the property on every subdirectory. If the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> value is different in a child directory then the child's value completely overrides the parents, so there is no ""additive"" effect. So if you change the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> on the root <code>.</code>, then you must change it with <code>--recursive</code> to overwrite it on the child and descendant directories. I note that the command-line syntax is counter-intuitive. I started-off assuming that you would ignore a file in SVN by typing something like <code>svn ignore pathToFileToIgnore.txt</code> however this is not how SVN's ignore feature works. 3- The <code>svn:global-ignores</code> property. Requires SVN 1.8 (June 2013): This is similar to <code>svn:ignore</code>, except it makes use of SVN 1.8's ""inherited properties"" feature. Compare to <code>svn:ignore</code>, the file pattern is automatically applied in every descendant directory (not just immediate children). This means that is unnecessary to set <code>svn:global-ignores</code> with the <code>--recursive</code> flag, as inherited ignore file patterns are automatically applied as they're inherited. Running the same set of commands as in the previous example, but using <code>svn:global-ignores</code> instead: For TortoiseSVN users: This whole arrangement was confusing for me, because TortoiseSVN's terminology (as used in their Windows Explorer menu system) was initially misleading to me - I was unsure what the significance of the Ignore menu's ""Add  recursively"", ""Add *"" and ""Add "" options. I hope this post explains how the Ignore feature ties-in to the SVN Properties feature. That said, I suggest using the command-line to set ignored files so you get a feel for how it works instead of using the GUI, and only using the GUI to manipulate properties after you're comfortable with the command-line. Listing files that are ignored: The command <code>svn status</code> will hide ignored files (that is, files that match an RGA <code>global-ignores</code> pattern, or match an immediate parent directory's <code>svn:ignore</code> pattern or match any ancesor directory's <code>svn:global-ignores</code> pattern. Use the <code>--no-ignore</code> option to see those files listed. Ignored files have a status of <code>I</code>, then pipe the output to <code>grep</code> to only show lines starting with ""I"". The command is: For example: ta-da!","You can ignore files in Subversion using 3 methods: 

1. Runtime Configuration Area's global-ignores option (client-side only)
2. svn:ignore property (stored in the repo, applied to directories, non-recursive)

Beware character comparisons through inequalities - although if you limit yourself to ASCII (0-127) you're just about safe.

93539,What is the difference between Views and Materialized Views in Oracle?,"Views evaluate the data in the tables underlying the view definition at the time the view is queried. It is a logical view of your tables, with no data stored anywhere else. The upside of a view is that it will always return the latest data to you. The downside of a view is that its performance depends on how good a select statement the view is based on. If the select statement used by the view joins many tables, or uses joins based on non-indexed columns, the view could perform poorly. Materialized views are similar to regular views, in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement), however, the underlying query resultset has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view, you are querying a table, which may also be indexed. In addition, because all the joins have been resolved at materialized view refresh time, you pay the price of the join once (or as often as you refresh your materialized view), rather than each time you select from the materialized view. In addition, with query rewrite enabled, Oracle can optimize a query that selects from the source of your materialized view in such a way that it instead reads from your materialized view. In situations where you create materialized views as forms of aggregate tables, or as copies of frequently executed queries, this can greatly speed up the response time of your end user application. The downside though is that the data you get back from the materialized view is only as up to date as the last time the materialized view has been refreshed. Materialized views can be set to refresh manually, on a set schedule, or based on the database detecting a change in data from one of the underlying tables. Materialized views can be incrementally updated by combining them with materialized view logs, which act as change data capture sources on the underlying tables. Materialized views are most often used in data warehousing / business intelligence applications where querying large fact tables with thousands of millions of rows would result in query response times that resulted in an unusable application.","Views evaluate data on query, while Materialized Views store query results in a table, improving performance by pre-resolving joins and allowing for faster query optimization.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"So number 1 above. What is Inversion of Control? Maintenance is the number one thing it solves for me. It guarantees I am using interfaces so that two classes are not intimate with each other. In using a container like Castle Windsor, it solves maintenance issues even better. Being able to swap out a component that goes to a database for one that uses file based persistence without changing a line of code is awesome (configuration change, you're done). And once you get into generics, it gets even better. Imagine having a message publisher that receives records and publishes messages. It doesn't care what it publishes, but it needs a mapper to take something from a record to a message. I wrote it once, but now I can inject many types into this set of code if I publish different types of messages. I can also write mappers that take a record of the same type and map them to different messages. Using DI with Generics has given me the ability to write very little code to accomplish many tasks.

100003,What are metaclasses in Python?,"<em>Note, this answer is for Python 2.x as it was written in 2008, metaclasses are slightly different in 3.x, see the comments.</em> Metaclasses are the secret sauce that make 'class' work. The default metaclass for a new style object is called 'type'. Metaclasses take 3 args. '<strong>name</strong>', '<strong>bases</strong>' and '<strong>dict</strong>' Here is where the secret starts. Look for where name, bases and the dict come from in this example class definition. Lets define a metaclass that will demonstrate how '<strong>class:</strong>' calls it. And now, an example that actually means something, this will automatically make the variables in the list ""attributes"" set on the class, and set to None. Note that the magic behaviour that 'Initalised' gains by having the metaclass <code>init_attributes</code> is not passed onto a subclass of Initalised. Here is an even more concrete example, showing how you can subclass 'type' to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created. This is quite tricky:","Metaclasses are the secret sauce that make 'class' work, taking 3 args: 'name', 'bases', and 'dict'.

100003,What are metaclasses in Python?,"I think the ONLamp introduction to metaclass programming is well written and gives a really good introduction to the topic despite being several years old already. http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/04/17/metaclasses.html (archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20080206005253/http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/04/17/metaclasses.html) In short: A class is a blueprint for the creation of an instance, a metaclass is a blueprint for the creation of a class. It can be easily seen that in Python classes need to be first-class objects too to enable this behavior. I've never written one myself, but I think one of the nicest uses of metaclasses can be seen in the Django framework.

While the metaclass is creating the class, all members get the possibility to customize the class itself. <li>Creating a new model <li>The metaclass enabling this The thing that's left to say is: If you don't know what metaclasses are, the probability that you <strong>will not need them</strong> is 99%.","A class is a blueprint for an instance, a metaclass is a blueprint for a class, allowing classes to be first-class objects in Python.",,"In short: A class is a blueprint for the creation of an instance, a metaclass is a blueprint for the creation of a class."

100003,What are metaclasses in Python?,"A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves, a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows), the more useful approach is actually to make it an actual class itself. <code>type</code> is the usual metaclass in Python. In case you're wondering, yes, <code>type</code> is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won't be able to recreate something like <code>type</code> purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass <code>type</code>. A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. Like you create an instance of the class by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the 'class' statement) by calling the metaclass. Combined with the normal <code>__init__</code> and <code>__new__</code> methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to do 'extra things' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry, or even replace the class with something else entirely. When the <code>class</code> statement is executed, Python first executes the body of the <code>class</code> statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the <code>__metaclass__</code> attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the <code>__metaclass__</code> global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name, bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it. However, metaclasses actually define the <em>type</em> of a class, not just a factory for it, so you can do much more with them. You can, for instance, define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods, in that they can be called on the class without an instance, but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. <code>type.__subclasses__()</code> is an example of a method on the <code>type</code> metaclass. You can also define the normal 'magic' methods, like <code>__add__</code>, <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__getattr__</code>, to implement or change how the class behaves. Here's an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:","A metaclass is the class of a class, defining how a class behaves. It's usually an instance of the `type` class, which is also a class itself. Metaclasses can be used as class factories, allowing you to perform actions when creating a class, such as registering or replacing the class.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Model-View-Presenter In MVP, the Presenter contains the UI business logic for the View. All invocations from the View delegate directly to Presenter. The Presenter is also decoupled directly from the View and talks to it through an interface. This is to allow mocking of the View in a unit test. One common attribute of MVP is that there has to be a lot of two-way dispatching. For example, when someone clicks the ""Save"" button, the event handler delegates to the Presenter's ""OnSave"" method. Once the save is completed, the Presenter will then call back the View through its interface so that the View can display that the save has completed. MVP tends to be a very natural pattern for achieving separated presentation in Web Forms. The reason is that the View is always created first by the ASP.NET runtime. You can find out more about both variants. Two primary variations Passive View: The View is as dumb as possible and contains almost zero logic. The Presenter is a middle man that talks to the View and the Model. The View and Model are completely shielded from one another. The Model may raise events, but the Presenter subscribes to them for updating the View. In Passive View there is no direct data binding, instead the View exposes setter properties which the Presenter uses to set the data. All state is managed in the Presenter and not the View. Pro: maximum testability surface; clean separation of the View and Model Con: more work (for example all the setter properties) as you are doing all the data binding yourself. Supervising Controller: The Presenter handles user gestures. The View binds to the Model directly through data binding. In this case it's the Presenter's job to pass off the Model to the View so that it can bind to it. The Presenter will also contain logic for gestures like pressing a button, navigation, etc. Pro: by leveraging databinding the amount of code is reduced. Con: there's less testable surface (because of data binding), and there's less encapsulation in the View since it talks directly to the Model. Model-View-Controller In the MVC, the Controller is responsible for determining which View to display in response to any action including when the application loads. This differs from MVP where actions route through the View to the Presenter. In MVC, every action in the View correlates with a call to a Controller along with an action. In the web each action involves a call to a URL on the other side of which there is a Controller who responds. Once that Controller has completed its processing, it will return the correct View. The sequence continues in that manner throughout the life of the application: One other big difference about MVC is that the View does not directly bind to the Model. The view simply renders, and is completely stateless. In implementations of MVC the View usually will not have any logic in the code behind. This is contrary to MVP where it is absolutely necessary because, if the View does not delegate to the Presenter, it will never get called. Presentation Model One other pattern to look at is the Presentation Model pattern. In this pattern there is no Presenter. Instead the View binds directly to a Presentation Model. The Presentation Model is a Model crafted specifically for the View. This means this Model can expose properties that one would never put on a domain model as it would be a violation of separation-of-concerns. In this case, the Presentation Model binds to the domain model, and may subscribe to events coming from that Model. The View then subscribes to events coming from the Presentation Model and updates itself accordingly. The Presentation Model can expose commands which the view uses for invoking actions. The advantage of this approach is that you can essentially remove the code-behind altogether as the PM completely encapsulates all of the behaviour for the view. This pattern is a very strong candidate for use in WPF applications and is also called Model-View-ViewModel. There is a MSDN article about the Presentation Model and a section in the Composite Application Guidance for WPF (former Prism) about Separated Presentation Patterns","Model-View-Patterns (MVP and MVC) are software design patterns that separate presentation logic from business logic.

106508,What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer In computer science, a smart pointer   is an abstract data type that   simulates a pointer while providing   additional features, such as automatic   garbage collection or bounds checking.   These additional features are intended   to reduce bugs caused by the misuse of   pointers while retaining efficiency.   Smart pointers typically keep track of   the objects that point to them for the   purpose of memory management. The   misuse of pointers is a major source   of bugs: the constant allocation,   deallocation and referencing that must   be performed by a program written   using pointers makes it very likely   that some memory leaks will occur.   Smart pointers try to prevent memory   leaks by making the resource   deallocation automatic: when the   pointer to an object (or the last in a   series of pointers) is destroyed, for   example because it goes out of scope,   the pointed object is destroyed too.","A smart pointer is an abstract data type that simulates a pointer, providing features like garbage collection and bounds checking to reduce bugs caused by pointer misuse.",,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer Smart pointer is a pointer-like type with some additional functionality, e.g. automatic memory deallocation, reference counting etc."
106508,What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?,"A smart pointer is a class that wraps a 'raw' (or 'bare') C++ pointer, to manage the lifetime of the object being pointed to. There is no single smart pointer type, but all of them try to abstract a raw pointer in a practical way. Smart pointers should be preferred over raw pointers. If you feel you need to use pointers (first consider if you really do), you would normally want to use a smart pointer as this can alleviate many of the problems with raw pointers, mainly forgetting to delete the object and leaking memory. With raw pointers, the programmer has to explicitly destroy the object when it is no longer useful. A smart pointer by comparison defines a policy as to when the object is destroyed. You still have to create the object, but you no longer have to worry about destroying it. The simplest policy in use involves the scope of the smart pointer wrapper object, such as implemented by <code>boost::scoped_ptr</code> or <code>std::unique_ptr</code>. Note that <code>scoped_ptr</code> instances cannot be copied. This prevents the pointer from being deleted multiple times (incorrectly). You can, however, pass references to it around to other functions you call. Scoped pointers are useful when you want to tie the lifetime of the object to a particular block of code, or if you embedded it as member data inside another object, the lifetime of that other object. The object exists until the containing block of code is exited, or until the containing object is itself destroyed. A more complex smart pointer policy involves reference counting the pointer. This does allow the pointer to be copied. When the last ""reference"" to the object is destroyed, the object is deleted. This policy is implemented by <code>boost::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code>. Reference counted pointers are very useful when the lifetime of your object is much more complicated, and is not tied directly to a particular section of code or to another object. There is one drawback to reference counted pointers Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?the possibility of creating a dangling reference: Another possibility is creating circular references: To work around this problem, both Boost and C++11 have defined a <code>weak_ptr</code> to define a weak (uncounted) reference to a <code>shared_ptr</code>. UPDATE This answer is rather old, and so describes what was 'good' at the time, which was smart pointers provided by the Boost library. Since C++11, the standard library has provided sufficient smart pointers types, and so you should favour the use of <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, <code>std::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::weak_ptr</code>. There is also <code>std::auto_ptr</code>. It is very much like a scoped pointer, except that it also has the ""special"" dangerous ability to be copied Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?which also unexpectedly transfers ownership! It is deprecated in the newest standards, so you shouldn't use it. Use the <code>std::unique_ptr</code> instead.","A smart pointer is a class that manages the lifetime of an object, abstracting a raw C++ pointer. There are two main types:

109023,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"This is known as the 'Hamming Weight', 'popcount' or 'sideways addition'. The 'best' algorithm really depends on which CPU you are on and what your usage pattern is. Some CPUs have a single built-in instruction to do it and others have parallel instructions which act on bit vectors. The parallel instructions (like x86's <code>popcnt</code>, on CPUs where it's supported) will almost certainly be fastest. Some other architectures may have a slow instruction implemented with a microcoded loop that tests a bit per cycle (citation needed). A pre-populated table lookup method can be very fast if your CPU has a large cache and/or you are doing lots of these instructions in a tight loop. However it can suffer because of the expense of a 'cache miss', where the CPU has to fetch some of the table from main memory. If you know that your bytes will be mostly 0's or mostly 1's then there are very efficient algorithms for these scenarios. I believe a very good general purpose algorithm is the following, known as 'parallel' or 'variable-precision SWAR algorithm'. I have expressed this in a C-like pseudo language, you may need to adjust it to work for a particular language (e.g. using uint32_t for C++ and >>> in Java): This has the best worst-case behaviour of any of the algorithms discussed, so will efficiently deal with any usage pattern or values you throw at it. This bitwise-SWAR algorithm could parallelize to be done in multiple vector elements at once, instead of in a single integer register, for a speedup on CPUs with SIMD but no usable popcount instruction. (e.g. x86-64 code that has to run on any CPU, not just Nehalem or later.) However, the best way to use vector instructions for popcount is usually by using a variable-shuffle to do a table-lookup for 4 bits at a time of each byte in parallel. (The 4 bits index a 16 entry table held in a vector register). On Intel CPUs, the hardware 64bit popcnt instruction can outperform an SSSE3 <code>PSHUFB</code> bit-parallel implementation by about a factor of 2, but only if your compiler gets it just right. Otherwise SSE can come out significantly ahead. Newer compiler versions are aware of the popcnt false dependency problem on Intel.

109023,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"Also consider the built-in functions of your compilers. On the GNU compiler for example you can just use: In the worst case the compiler will generate a call to a function. In the best case the compiler will emit a cpu instruction to do the same job faster. The GCC intrinsics even work across multiple platforms. Popcount will become mainstream in the x86 architecture, so it makes sense to start using the intrinsic now. Other architectures have the popcount for years. On x86, you can tell the compiler that it can assume support for <code>popcnt</code> instruction with <code>-mpopcnt</code> or <code>-msse4.2</code> to also enable the vector instructions that were added in the same generation. See GCC x86 options. <code>-march=nehalem</code> (or <code>-march=</code> whatever CPU you want your code to assume and to tune for) could be a good choice. Running the resulting binary on an older CPU will result in an illegal-instruction fault. To make binaries optimized for the machine you build them on, use <code>-march=native</code>  (with gcc, clang, or ICC). MSVC provides an intrinsic for the x86 <code>popcnt</code> instruction, but unlike gcc it's really an intrinsic for the hardware instruction and requires hardware support. Using <code>std::bitset&lt;&gt;::count()</code> instead of a built-in In theory, any compiler that knows how to popcount efficiently for the target CPU should expose that functionality through ISO C++ <code>std::bitset&lt;&gt;</code>. In practice, you might be better off with the bit-hack AND/shift/ADD in some cases for some target CPUs. For target architectures where hardware popcount is an optional extension (like x86), not all compilers have a <code>std::bitset</code> that takes advantage of it when available. For example, MSVC has no way to enable <code>popcnt</code> support at compile time, and always uses a table lookup, even with <code>/Ox /arch:AVX</code> (which implies SSE4.2, although technically there is a separate feature bit for <code>popcnt</code>.) But at least you get something portable that works everywhere, and with gcc/clang with the right target options, you get hardware popcount for architectures that support it. See asm from gcc, clang, icc, and MSVC on the Godbolt compiler explorer. x86-64 <code>gcc -O3 -std=gnu++11 -mpopcnt</code> emits this: PowerPC64 <code>gcc -O3 -std=gnu++11</code> emits (for the <code>int</code> arg version): This source isn't x86-specific or GNU-specific at all, but only compiles well for x86 with gcc/clang/icc. Also note that gcc's fallback for architectures without single-instruction popcount is a byte-at-a-time table lookup. This isn't wonderful for ARM, for example.","To count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer, consider using built-in functions like GCC's `popcnt` intrinsic or MSVC's `__popcnt` intrinsic for x86 architecture, or the `std::bitset::count()` method, which may use hardware popcount if available.",,

That means that in MVP standard web form page life cycle is just enhanced by extracting the business logic from code behind. In other words, page is the one servicing http request. In other words, MVP IMHO is web form evolutionary type of enhancement. MVC on other hand changes completely the game because the request gets intercepted by controller class before page is loaded, the business logic is executed there and then at the end result of controller processing the data just dumped to the page (""view"") In that sense, MVC looks (at least to me) a lot to Supervising Controller flavor of MVP enhanced with routing engine Both of them enable TDD and have downsides and upsides. Decision on how to choose one of them IMHO should be based on how much time one invested in ASP NET web form type of web development.

This is a slight variation on Jon's comments. First add this interface to your codebase. Its implementers can answer when a certain predicate is true of a certain type. E.g. If <code>T</code> were <code>User</code> and <code>AuthorizedUserPredicate&lt;User&gt;</code> implements <code>IPredicate&lt;T&gt;</code>, then <code>AuthorizedUserPredicate#apply</code> returns whether the passed in <code>User</code> is authorized.

The domain object that has the target collection would have filtering logic for the methods that initialize, add and set the target collection.

If you want to simply collect all the users which match the predicate, then use the <code>Collectors</code> to terminate the stream in the desired collection.

The semaphore advertises that a resource is available, and it provides the mechanism to wait until it is signaled as being available.

129329,Optimistic vs. Pessimistic locking,Optimistic locking is used when you don't expect many collisions. It costs less to do a normal operation but if the collision DOES occur you would pay a higher price to resolve it as the transaction is aborted. Pessimistic locking is used when a collision is anticipated. The transactions which would violate synchronization are simply blocked.

129329,Optimistic vs. Pessimistic locking,"Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, take note of a version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or checksums/hashes) and check that the version hasn't changed before you write the record back. When you write the record back you filter the update on the version to make sure it's atomic. (i.e. hasn't been updated between when you check the version and write the record to the disk) and update the version in one hit. If the record is dirty (i.e. different version to yours) you abort the transaction and the user can re-start it. This strategy is most applicable to high-volume systems and three-tier architectures where you do not necessarily maintain a connection to the database for your session. In this situation the client cannot actually maintain database locks as the connections are taken from a pool and you may not be using the same connection from one access to the next. Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it. It has much better integrity than optimistic locking but requires you to be careful with your application design to avoid Deadlocks. To use pessimistic locking you need either a direct connection to the database (as would typically be the case in a two tier client server application) or an externally available transaction ID that can be used independently of the connection. In the latter case you open the transaction with the TxID and then reconnect using that ID. The DBMS maintains the locks and allows you to pick the session back up through the TxID. This is how distributed transactions using two-phase commit protocols (such as XA or COM+ Transactions) work.","Optimistic Locking checks for changes before updating a record, using a version number or timestamp, and re-tries if the record has changed.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"Paraphrased from Brian Button: They are generally used as a global instance, why is that so bad? Because you hide the dependencies of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces. Making something global to avoid passing it around is a code smell. They violate the single responsibility principle: by virtue of the fact that they control their own creation and lifecycle. They inherently cause code to be tightly coupled. This makes faking them out under test rather difficult in many cases. They carry state around for the lifetime of the application. Another hit to testing since you can end up with a situation where tests need to be ordered which is a big no no for unit tests. Why? Because each unit test should be independent from the other.","Singletons are problematic because they hide dependencies, violate the single responsibility principle, cause tight coupling, make testing difficult, and require test ordering.",,"Because you hide the dependencies of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces.

One thing to note, if you DO use singletons, try to pass them in to whoever needs them rather than have them access it directly...

The problem is that the pattern is often used by people developing software with object-oriented tools without having a solid grasp of OO concepts.

This happens because arrays in PHP are not linear structures like they are in most languages. They are more like hash tables that may or may not have keys for all stored values. Hence foreach doesn't use indexes to crawl over them because they only have an index if the array is defined.

141525,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"Let's say we have a single byte: Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte. The bits don't rollover; they are discarded. That means if you left shift 1101100 and then right shift it, you won't get the same result back. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N. Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2N and rounding to zero. Bitshifting can be used for insanely fast multiplication and division, provided you are working with a power of 2. Almost all low-level graphics routines use bitshifting. For example, way back in the olden days, we used mode 13h (320x200 256 colors) for games. In Mode 13h, the video memory was laid out sequentially per pixel. That meant to calculate the location for a pixel, you would use the following math: Now, back in that day and age, speed was critical, so we would use bitshifts to do this operation. However, 320 is not a power of two, so to get around this we have to find out what is a power of two that added together makes 320: Now we can convert that into left shifts: For a final result of: Now we get the same offset as before, except instead of an expensive multiplication operation, we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this (note, it's been forever since I've done assembly (editor's note: corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example)): Total: 28 cycles on whatever ancient CPU had these timings. Vrs 12 cycles on the same ancient CPU. Yes, we would work this hard to shave off 16 CPU cycles. In 32 or 64-bit mode, both versions get a lot shorter and faster. Modern out-of-order execution CPUs like Intel Skylake (see http://agner.org/optimize/) have very fast hardware multiply (low latency and high throughput), so the gain is much smaller. AMD Bulldozer-family is a bit slower, especially for 64-bit multiply. On Intel CPUs, and AMD Ryzen, two shifts are slightly lower latency but more instructions than a multiply (which may lead to lower throughput): vs. Compilers will do this for you: See how gcc, clang, and MSVC all use shift+lea when optimizing <code>return 320*row + col;</code>. The most interesting thing to note here is that x86 has a shift-and-add instruction (<code>LEA</code>) that can do small left shifts and add at the same time, with the performance as and <code>add</code> instruction. ARM is even more powerful: one operand of any instruction can be left or right shifted for free. So scaling by a compile-time-constant that's known to be a power-of-2 can be even more efficient than a multiply. OK, back in the modern days... something more useful now would be to use bitshifting to store two 8-bit values in a 16-bit integer. For example, in C#: In C++, compilers should do this for you if you used a <code>struct</code> with two 8-bit members, but in practice don't always.","Bitwise shift operators shift the bits of a binary number to the left or right. A left shift by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2^N, while a right shift by N is equivalent to dividing by 2^N and rounding to zero. Bitshifting can be used for fast multiplication and division by powers of 2, and is commonly used in low-level programming for graphics and other applications.",,"Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte. The bits don't rollover; they are discarded. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N. Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2N and rounding to zero."

141525,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"The bit shifting operators do exactly what their name implies. They shift bits. Here's a brief (or not-so-brief) introduction to the different shift operators. The Operators <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the left shift operator, and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts. All of these operators can be applied to integer values (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, possibly <code>short</code> and <code>byte</code> or <code>char</code>). In some languages, applying the shift operators to any datatype smaller than <code>int</code> automatically resizes the operand to be an <code>int</code>. Note that <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> is not an operator, because it would be redundant. Also note that C and C++ do not distinguish between the right shift operators. They provide only the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator, and the right-shifting behavior is implementation defined for signed types. Left shift (&lt;&lt;) Integers are stored, in memory, as a series of bits. For example, the number 6 stored as a 32-bit <code>int</code> would be: Shifting this bit pattern to the left one position (<code>6 &lt;&lt; 1</code>) would result in the number 12: As you can see, the digits have shifted to the left by one position, and the last digit on the right is filled with a zero. You might also note that shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2. So <code>6 &lt;&lt; 1</code> is equivalent to <code>6 * 2</code>, and <code>6 &lt;&lt; 3</code> is equivalent to <code>6 * 8</code>. A good optimizing compiler will replace multiplications with shifts when possible. Non-circular shifting Please note that these are <em>not</em> circular shifts. Shifting this value to the left by one position (<code>3,758,096,384 &lt;&lt; 1</code>): results in 3,221,225,472: The digit that gets shifted ""off the end"" is lost. It does not wrap around. Logical right shift (>>>) A logical right shift is the converse to the left shift. Rather than moving bits to the left, they simply move to the right. For example, shifting the number 12: to the right by one position (<code>12 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1</code>) will get back our original 6: So we see that shifting to the right is equivalent to division by powers of 2. Lost bits are gone However, a shift cannot reclaim ""lost"" bits. For example, if we shift this pattern: to the left 4 positions (<code>939,524,102 &lt;&lt; 4</code>), we get 2,147,483,744: and then shifting back (<code>(939,524,102 &lt;&lt; 4) &gt;&gt;&gt; 4</code>) we get 134,217,734: We cannot get back our original value once we have lost bits. Arithmetic right shift (>>) The arithmetic right shift is exactly like the logical right shift, except instead of padding with zero, it pads with the most significant bit. This is because the most significant bit is the <em>sign</em> bit, or the bit that distinguishes positive and negative numbers. By padding with the most significant bit, the arithmetic right shift is sign-preserving. For example, if we interpret this bit pattern as a negative number: we have the number -2,147,483,552. Shifting this to the right 4 positions with the arithmetic shift (-2,147,483,552 >> 4) would give us: or the number -134,217,722. So we see that we have preserved the sign of our negative numbers by using the arithmetic right shift, rather than the logical right shift. And once again, we see that we are performing division by powers of 2.","Bit shifting operators in C++ shift bits in a binary number. There are three operators: 

* `>>` (arithmetic right shift) shifts bits to the right, preserving the sign bit.
* `>>>` (logical right shift) shifts bits to the right, padding with zeros.
* `<<` (left shift) shifts bits to the left, equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2.
 
These operators can be applied to integer values and are used for efficient multiplication and division by powers of 2.",,"The bit shifting operators do exactly what their name implies. They shift bits. <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the left shift operator, and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts.

141525,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming. If you read a specification for a device or even some binary file formats, you will see bytes, words, and dwords, broken up into non-byte aligned bitfields, which contain various values of interest. Accessing these bit-fields for reading/writing is the most common usage. A simple real example in graphics programming is that a 16-bit pixel is represented as follows: To get at the green value you would do this: <strong>Explanation</strong> In order to obtain the value of green ONLY, which starts at offset 5 and ends at 10 (i.e. 6-bits long), you need to use a (bit) mask, which when applied against the entire 16-bit pixel, will yield only the bits we are interested in. The appropriate mask is 0x7E0 which in binary is 0000011111100000 (which is 2016 in decimal). To apply a mask, you use the AND operator (&amp;). After applying the mask, you'll end up with a 16-bit number which is really just a 11-bit number since its MSB is in the 11th bit. Green is actually only 6-bits long, so we need to scale it down using a right shift (11 - 6 = 5), hence the use of 5 as offset (<code>#define GREEN_OFFSET  5</code>). Also common is using bit shifts for fast multiplication and division by powers of 2:","Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level programming, used for accessing specific bit-fields in bytes, words, or dwords.",,"Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming.

148747,What is the difference between a framework and a library?,"Actually these terms can mean a lot of different things depending the context they are used. For example, on Mac OS X frameworks are just libraries, packed into a bundle. Within the bundle you will find an actual dynamic library (libWhatever.dylib). The difference between a bare library and the framework on Mac is that a framework can contain multiple different versions of the library. It can contain extra resources (images, localized strings, XML data files, UI objects, etc.) and unless the framework is released to public, it usually contains the necessary .h files you need to use the library. Thus you have everything within a single package you need to use the library in your application (a C/C++/Objective-C library without .h files is pretty useless, unless you write them yourself according to some library documentation), instead of a bunch of files to move around (a Mac bundle is just a directory on the Unix level, but the UI treats it like a single file, pretty much like you have JAR files in Java and when you click it, you usually don't see what's inside, unless you explicitly select to show the content). Wikipedia calls framework a ""buzzword"". It defines a software framework as A software framework is a re-usable  design for a software system (or  subsystem). A software framework may  include support programs, code  libraries, a scripting language, or  other software to help develop and  glue together the different components  of a software project. Various parts  of the framework may be exposed  through an API.. So I'd say a library is just that, ""a library"". It is a collection of objects/functions/methods (depending on your language) and your application ""links"" against it and thus can use the objects/functions/methods. It is basically a file containing re-usable code that can usually be shared among multiple applications (you don't have to write the same code over and over again). A framework can be everything you use in application development. It can be a library, a collection of many libraries, a collection of scripts, or any piece of software you need to create your application. Framework is just a very vague term. Here's an article about some guy regarding the topic ""Library vs. Framework"". I personally think this article is highly arguable. It's not wrong what he's saying there, however, he's just picking out one of the multiple definitions of framework and compares that to the classic definition of library. E.g. he says you need a framework for sub-classing. Really? I can have an object defined in a library, I can link against it, and sub-class it in my code. I don't see how I need a ""framework"" for that. In some way he rather explains how the term framework is used nowadays. It's just a hyped word, as I said before. Some companies release just a normal library (in any sense of a classical library) and call it a ""framework"" because it sounds more fancy.","A framework and a library are often confused terms, but a library is a collection of re-usable code that can be shared among multiple applications, whereas a framework is a more general term that can include a library, a collection of libraries, or any software needed for application development.",,"The difference between a bare library and the framework on Mac is that a framework can contain multiple different versions of the library.

154577,Polymorphism vs Overriding vs Overloading,"<strong>Polymorphism</strong> is the ability of a class instance to behave as if it were an instance of another class in its inheritance tree, most often one of its ancestor classes. For example, in Java all classes inherit from Object. Therefore, you can create a variable of type Object and assign to it an instance of any class. An <strong>override</strong> is a type of function which occurs in a class which inherits from another class. An override function ""replaces"" a function inherited from the base class, but does so in such a way that it is called even when an instance of its class is pretending to be a different type through polymorphism. Referring to the previous example, you could define your own class and override the toString() function. Because this function is inherited from Object, it will still be available if you copy an instance of this class into an Object-type variable. Normally, if you call toString() on your class while it is pretending to be an Object, the version of toString which will actually fire is the one defined on Object itself. However, because the function is an override, the definition of toString() from your class is used even when the class instance's true type is hidden behind polymorphism. <strong>Overloading</strong> is the action of defining multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters. It is unrelated to either overriding or polymorphism.","Polymorphism allows a class instance to behave like another class in its inheritance tree. Overriding is a function in a subclass that replaces a function from its parent class, while polymorphism is in effect.

154577,Polymorphism vs Overriding vs Overloading,"Specifically saying overloading or overriding doesn't give the full picture. Polymorphism is simply the ability of an object to specialize its behavior based on its type. I would disagree with some of the answers here in that overloading is a form of polymorphism (parametric polymorphism) in the case that a method with the same name can behave differently give different parameter types. A good example is operator overloading. You can define ""+"" to accept different types of parameters -- say strings or int's -- and based on those types, ""+"" will behave differently. Polymorphism also includes inheritance and overriding methods, though they can be abstract or virtual in the base type. In terms of inheritance-based polymorphism, Java only supports single class inheritance limiting it polymorphic behavior to that of a single chain of base types. Java does support implementation of multiple interfaces which is yet another form of polymorphic behavior.","Polymorphism is the ability of an object to specialize its behavior based on its type, including overloading, inheritance, and method overriding.","Polymorphism also includes inheritance and overriding methods, though they can be abstract or virtual in the base type.","Polymorphism is simply the ability of an object to specialize its behavior based on its type.

However, it should not be normally used because it is invoked after the GC and you can't tell when that will happen (if ever).

171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"The closest equivalent to a destructor in Java is the finalize() method. The big difference to a traditional destructor is that you can't be sure when it'll be called, since that's the responsibility of the garbage collector. I'd strongly recommend carefully reading up on this before using it, since your typical RAIA patterns for file handles and so on won't work reliably with finalize().","The closest equivalent to a destructor in Java is the finalize() method, which is called by the garbage collector.",,The closest equivalent to a destructor in Java is the finalize() method.
171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"Nope, no destructors here. The reason is that all Java objects are heap allocated and garbage collected. Without explicit deallocation (i.e. C++'s delete operator) there is no sensible way to implement real destructors. Java does support finalizers, but they are meant to be used only as a safeguard for objects holding a handle to native resources like sockets, file handles, window handles, etc. When the garbage collector collects an object without a finalizer it simply marks the memory region as free and that's it. When the object has a finalizer, it's first copied into a temporary location (remember, we're garbage collecting here), then it's enqueued into a waiting-to-be-finalized queue and then a Finalizer thread polls the queue with very low priority and runs the finalizer. When the application exits, the JVM stops without waiting for the pending objects to be finalized, so there practically no guarantees that your finalizers will ever run.","Java does not have a destructor, instead using finalizers for native resource cleanup, which run with low priority and no guarantees of execution at application exit.",,"Nope, no destructors here. The reason is that all Java objects are heap allocated and garbage collected."
171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"Use of finalize() methods should be avoided. They are not a reliable mechanism for resource clean up and it is possible to cause problems in the garbage collector by abusing them. If you require a deallocation call in your object, say to release resources, use an explicit method call. This convention can be seen in existing APIs (e.g. Closeable, Graphics.dispose(), Widget.dispose()) and is usually called via try/finally. Attempts to use a disposed object should throw a runtime exception (see IllegalStateException). EDIT: I was thinking, if all I did was just   to dereference the data and wait for   the garbage collector to collect them,   wouldn't there be a memory leak if my   user repeatedly entered data and   pressed the reset button? Generally, all you need to do is dereference the objects - at least, this is the way it is supposed to work. If you are worried about garbage collection, check out Java SE 6 HotSpot[tm] Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning (or the equivalent document for your JVM version).","Use a try/finally block with an explicit method call (e.g. Closeable, Graphics.dispose()) for resource cleanup, as finalize() methods are unreliable and can cause garbage collector issues.",,"Generally, all you need to do is dereference the objects - at least, this is the way it is supposed to work."

171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"I fully agree to other answers, saying not to rely on the execution of finalize. In addition to try-catch-finally blocks, you may use Runtime#addShutdownHook (introduced in Java 1.6) to perform final cleanups in your program. That isn't the same as destructors are, but one may implement a shutdown hook having listener objects registered on which cleanup methods (close persistent database connections, remove file locks, and so on) can be invoked - things that would normally be done in destructors. Again - this is not a replacement for constructors but in some cases, you can approach the wanted functionality with this. The advantage of this is having deconstruction behaviorloosely coupled from the rest of your program.","Java does not have a traditional destructor, but you can use Runtime#addShutdownHook to perform cleanup tasks in a try-catch-finally block or through listener objects.",,"In addition to try-catch-finally blocks, you may use Runtime#addShutdownHook (introduced in Java 1.6) to perform final cleanups in your program."
171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"First, note that since Java is garbage-collected, it is rare to need to do anything about object destruction. Firstly because you don't usually have any managed resources to free, and secondly because you can't predict when or if it will happen, so it's inappropriate for things that you need to occur ""as soon as nobody is using my object any more"". You can be notified after an object has been destroyed using java.lang.ref.PhantomReference (actually, saying it has been destroyed may be slightly inaccurate, but if a phantom reference to it is queued then it's no longer recoverable, which usually amounts to the same thing). A common use is: Separate out the resource(s) in your class that need to be destructed into another helper object (note that if all you're doing is closing a connection, which is a common case, you don't need to write a new class: the connection to be closed would be the ""helper object"" in that case). When you create your main object, create also a PhantomReference to it. Either have this refer to the new helper object, or set up a map from PhantomReference objects to their corresponding helper objects. After the main object is collected, the PhantomReference is queued (or rather it may be queued - like finalizers there is no guarantee it ever will be, for example if the VM exits then it won't wait). Make sure you're processing its queue (either in a special thread or from time to time). Because of the hard reference to the helper object, the helper object has not yet been collected. So do whatever cleanup you like on the helper object, then discard the PhantomReference and the helper will eventually be collected too. There is also finalize(), which looks like a destructor but doesn't behave like one. It's usually not a good option.","Java does not have a destructor, but you can use PhantomReference to notify when an object is garbage-collected.",,"You can be notified after an object has been destroyed using java.lang.ref.PhantomReference (actually, saying it has been destroyed may be slightly inaccurate, but if a phantom reference to it is queued then it's no longer recoverable, which usually amounts to the same thing).

The downside is that doing this can cost a lot of overhead, especially if the data is very volatile.

184710,What is the difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy?,"In object oriented programming, a type includes a collection of member fields. These fields may be stored either by value or by reference (i.e., a pointer to a value). In a shallow copy, a new instance of the type is created and the values are copied into the new instance. The reference pointers are also copied just like the values. Therefore, the references are pointing to the original objects. Any changes to the members that are stored by reference appear in both the original and the copy, since no copy was made of the referenced object. In a deep copy, the fields that are stored by value are copied as before, but the pointers to objects stored by reference are not copied. Instead, a deep copy is made of the referenced object, and a pointer to the new object is stored. Any changes that are made to those referenced objects will not affect other copies of the object.","In object-oriented programming, a shallow copy creates a new instance with copied values and references to original objects, while a deep copy creates a new instance with copied values and copied referenced objects.",,"In a shallow copy, a new instance of the type is created and the values are copied into the new instance.

214741,What is a StackOverflowError?,"Stack overflow means exactly that: a stack overflows. Usually there's a one stack in the program that contains local-scope variables and addresses where to return when execution of a routine ends. That stack tends to be a fixed memory range somewhere in the memory, therefore it's limited how much it can contain values. If the stack is empty you can't pop, if you do you'll get stack underflow error. If the stack is full you can't push, if you do you'll get stack overflow error. So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion. Some implementations optimize out some forms of recursions. Tail recursion in particular. Tail recursive routines are form of routines where the recursive call appears as a final thing what the routine does. Such routine call gets simply reduced into a jump. Some implementations go so far as implement their own stacks for recursion, therefore they allow the recursion to continue until the system runs out of memory. Easiest thing you could try would be to increase your stack size if you can. If you can't do that though, the second best thing would be to look whether there's something that clearly causes the stack overflow. Try it by printing something before and after the call into routine. This helps you to find out the failing routine.","A StackOverflowError occurs when a program's stack is full due to excessive recursion or deep function calls, causing the program to run out of memory.",,"So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack.

Inside the $derek instance, we can refer to those as $this->first_name and $this->last_name ClassName:: is used to refer to that type of class, and its static variables, static methods. If it helps, you can mentally replace the word ""static"" with ""shared"". Because they are shared, they cannot refer to $this, which refers to a specific instance (not shared). Static Variables (i.e. static $db_connection) can be shared among all instances of a type of object. For example, all database objects share a single connection (static $connection). <strong>Static Variables Example:</strong>Pretend we have a database class with a single member variable: static $num_connections;Now, put this in the constructor: Just as objects have constructors, they also have destructors, which are executed when the object dies or is unset: Every time we create a new instance, it will increase our connection counter by one. Every time we destroy or stop using an instance, it will decrease the connection counter by one. In this way, we can monitor the number of instances of the database object we have in use with: Because $num_connections is static (shared), it will reflect the total number of active database objects. You may have seen this technique used to share database connections among all instances of a database class. This is done because creating the database connection takes a long time, so it's best to create just one, and share it (this is called a Singleton Pattern). Static Methods (i.e. public static View::format_phone_number($digits)) can be used WITHOUT first instantiating one of those objects (i.e. They do not internally refer to $this). <strong>Static Method Example:</strong> As you can see, public static function prettyName knows nothing about the object. It's just working with the parameters you pass in, like a normal function that's not part of an object. Why bother, then, if we could just have it not as part of the object? <li>First, attaching functions to objects helps you keep things organized, so you know where to find them. <li>Second, it prevents naming conflicts. In a big project, you're likely to have two developers create getName() functions. If one creates a ClassName1::getName(), and the other creates ClassName2::getName(), it's no problem at all. No conflict. Yay static methods! <strong>SELF::</strong>If you are coding <em>outside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you must call it using the object's name View::format_phone_number($phone_number);If you are coding <em>inside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to, you can <em>either</em> use the object's name View::format_phone_number($pn), OR you can use the self::format_phone_number($pn)  shortcut The same goes for static variables:<strong>Example:</strong> View::templates_path versus self::templates_path Inside the DB class, if we were referring to a static method of some other object, we would use the object's name:<strong>Example:</strong> Session::getUsersOnline(); But if the DB class wanted to refer to its own static variable, it would just say self:<strong>Example:</strong> self::connection; Hope that helps clear things up :)","Use `$this` to refer to a specific instance of a class's variables or methods, while `ClassName::` refers to the class itself and its static variables and methods. `self::` is a shortcut to the class itself when used inside the class.

224664,Difference between proxy server and reverse proxy server,"The difference is primarily in deployment. Web forward and reverse proxies all have the same underlying features, they accept requests for HTTP requests in various formats and provide a response, usually by accessing the origin or contact server. Fully featured servers usually have access control, caching, and some link-mapping features. A forward proxy is a proxy that is accessed by configuring the client machine. The client needs protocol support for proxy features (redirection, proxy auth, etc.). The proxy is transparent to the user experience, but not to the application. A reverse proxy is a proxy that is deployed as a web server and behaves like a web server, with the exception that instead of locally composing the content from programs and disk, it forwards the request to an origin server. From the client perspective it IS a web server, so the user experience is completely transparent. In fact, a single proxy instance can run as a forward and reverse proxy at the same time for different client populations. That's the short version, I can clarify if people want to comment.","The main difference between a proxy server and a reverse proxy server is their deployment: a forward proxy is accessed by the client, while a reverse proxy is deployed as a web server and forwards requests to an origin server, making it transparent to the user experience.",,"A forward proxy is a proxy that is accessed by configuring the client machine.

All I did was update the instance method to return the next connection from the pool - no other changes required. That would have been far harder if we had NOT been using a singleton. Singletons are just fancy globals Can't argue with that but so are all static fields and methods - anything that is accessed from the class rather than an instance is essentially global and I dont see so much pushback on the use of static fields?

255898,How to iterate over arguments in a Bash script,"Rewrite of a now-deleted answer by VonC. Robert Gamble's succinct answer deals directly with the question. This one amplifies on some issues with filenames containing spaces. See also: ${1:+""$@""} in /bin/sh Basic thesis: <code>""$@""</code> is correct, and <code>$*</code> (unquoted) is almost always wrong. This is because <code>""$@""</code> works fine when arguments contain spaces, and works the same as <code>$*</code> when they don't. In some circumstances, <code>""$*""</code> is OK too, but <code>""$@""</code> usually (but not always) works in the same places. Unquoted, <code>$@</code> and <code>$*</code> are equivalent (and almost always wrong). So, what is the difference between <code>$*</code>, <code>$@</code>, <code>""$*""</code>, and <code>""$@""</code>? They are all related to 'all the arguments to the shell', but they do different things. When unquoted, <code>$*</code> and <code>$@</code> do the same thing. They treat each 'word' (sequence of non-whitespace) as a separate argument. The quoted forms are quite different, though: <code>""$*""</code> treats the argument list as a single space-separated string, whereas <code>""$@""</code> treats the arguments almost exactly as they were when specified on the command line. <code>""$@""</code> expands to nothing at all when there are no positional arguments; <code>""$*""</code> expands to an empty string &mdash; and yes, there's a difference, though it can be hard to perceive it. See more information below, after the introduction of the (non-standard) command <code>al</code>. Secondary thesis: if you need to process arguments with spaces and then pass them on to other commands, then you sometimes need non-standard tools to assist. (Or you should use arrays, carefully: <code>""${array[@]}""</code> behaves analogously to <code>""$@""</code>.) Example: Why doesn't that work? It doesn't work because the shell processes quotes before it expands variables. So, to get the shell to pay attention to the quotes embedded in <code>$var</code>, you have to use <code>eval</code>: This gets really tricky when you have file names such as "" "" (with quotes and double quotes and spaces). The shells (all of them) do not make it particularly easy to handle such stuff, so (funnily enough) many Unix programs do not do a good job of handling them. On Unix, a filename (single component) can contain any characters except slash and NUL <code>'\0'</code>. However, the shells strongly encourage no spaces or newlines or tabs anywhere in a path names. It is also why standard Unix file names do not contain spaces, etc. When dealing with file names that may contain spaces and other troublesome characters, you have to be extremely careful, and I found long ago that I needed a program that is not standard on Unix. I call it <code>escape</code> (version 1.1 was dated 1989-08-23T16:01:45Z). Here is an example of <code>escape</code> in use - with the SCCS control system. It is a cover script that does both a <code>delta</code> (think check-in) and a <code>get</code> (think check-out). Various arguments, especially <code>-y</code> (the reason why you made the change) would contain blanks and newlines. Note that the script dates from 1992, so it uses back-ticks instead of <code>$(cmd ...)</code> notation and does not use <code>#!/bin/sh</code> on the first line. (I would probably not use escape quite so thoroughly these days - it is not needed with the <code>-e</code> argument, for example - but overall, this is one of my simpler scripts using <code>escape</code>.) The <code>escape</code> program simply outputs its arguments, rather like <code>echo</code> does, but it ensures that the arguments are protected for use with <code>eval</code> (one level of <code>eval</code>; I do have a program which did remote shell execution, and that needed to escape the output of <code>escape</code>). I have another program called <code>al</code> that lists its arguments one per line (and it is even more ancient: version 1.1 dated 1987-01-27T14:35:49). It is most useful when debugging scripts, as it can be plugged into a command line to see what arguments are actually passed to the command. [Added: And now to show the difference between the various <code>""$@""</code> notations, here is one more example: Notice that nothing preserves the original blanks between the <code>*</code> and <code>*/*</code> on the command line. Also, note that you can change the 'command line arguments' in the shell by using: This sets 4 options, '<code>-new</code>', '<code>-opt</code>', '<code>and</code>', and '<code>arg with space</code>'. ] Hmm, that's quite a long answer - perhaps exegesis is the better term. Source code for <code>escape</code> available on request (email to firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com). The source code for <code>al</code> is incredibly simple: That's all. It is equivalent to the <code>test.sh</code> script that Robert Gamble showed, and could be written as a shell function (but shell functions didn't exist in the local version of Bourne shell when I first wrote <code>al</code>). Also note that you can write <code>al</code> as a simple shell script: The conditional is needed so that it produces no output when passed no arguments. The <code>printf</code> command will produce a blank line with only the format string argument, but the C program produces nothing.","When iterating over arguments in a Bash script, use `""${1:+""$@""}` or `""@@""` to handle arguments with spaces correctly. Unquoted `$@` and `$*` are almost always wrong, while `""@@""` treats arguments as separate entities and `""*$""` treats them as a single space-separated string. If you need to process arguments with spaces and pass them to other commands, consider using non-standard tools or arrays.",,"Basic thesis: <code>""$@""</code> is correct, and <code>$*</code> (unquoted) is almost always wrong."
27581,What issues should be considered when overriding equals and hashCode in Java?,"There are some issues worth noticing if you're dealing with classes that are persisted using an Object-Relationship Mapper (ORM) like Hibernate, if you didn't think this was unreasonably complicated already! <strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return <code>false</code>. For example: <em>If you're dealing with an ORM, using <code>o instanceof Person</code> is the only thing that will behave correctly.</em> <strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong> ORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that <code>person.name</code> will be <code>null</code> if <code>person</code> is lazy loaded, even if <code>person.getName()</code> forces loading and returns ""John Doe"". In my experience, this crops up more often in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>. <em>If you're dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>.</em> <strong>Saving an object will change its state</strong> Persistent objects often use a <code>id</code> field to hold the key of the object. This field will be automatically updated when an object is first saved. Don't use an id field in <code>hashCode()</code>. But you can use it in <code>equals()</code>. A pattern I often use is But: you cannot include <code>getId()</code> in <code>hashCode()</code>. If you do, when an object is persisted, its <code>hashCode</code> changes. If the object is in a <code>HashSet</code>, you'll ""never"" find it again. In my <code>Person</code> example, I probably would use <code>getName()</code> for <code>hashCode</code> and <code>getId()</code> plus <code>getName()</code> (just for paranoia) for <code>equals()</code>. It's okay if there are some risk of ""collisions"" for <code>hashCode()</code>, but never okay for <code>equals()</code>. <em><code>hashCode()</code> should use the non-changing subset of properties from <code>equals()</code></em>","When overriding equals and hashCode in Java, consider the following issues:

1. Lazy loaded objects are subclasses and using `this.getClass() == o.getClass()` will return false.
2. Lazy loaded objects have null fields, so use getters in `hashCode()` and `equals()`.
3. Saving an object changes its state, so avoid using an id field in `hashCode()`, but use it in `equals()`.",,"<strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store.

214741,What is a StackOverflowError?,"Parameters and local variables are allocated on the stack (with reference types the object lives on the heap and a variable references that object). The stack typically lives at the upper end of your address space and as it is used up it heads towards the bottom of the address space (i.e. towards zero). Your process also has a heap, which lives at the bottom end of your process. As you allocate memory, this heap can grow towards the upper end of your address space. As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to ""collide"" with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!! ). The common cause for a stack overflow is a bad recursive call. Typically, this is caused when your recursive functions doesn't have the correct termination condition, so it ends up calling itself forever. However, with GUI programming, it's possible to generate indirect recursion. For example, your app may be handling paint messages, and, whilst processing them, it may call a function that causes the system to send another paint message. Here you've not explicitly called yourself, but the OS/VM has done it for you. To deal with them, you'll need to examine your code. If you've got functions that call themselves then check that you've got a terminating condition. If you have, then check that when calling the function you have at least modified one of the arguments, otherwise there'll be no visible change for the recursively called function and the terminating condition is useless. If you've got no obvious recursive functions then check to see if you're calling any library functions that indirectly will cause your function to be called (like the implicit case above).","A StackOverflowError occurs when the stack (where parameters and local variables are stored) collides with the heap (where objects are stored) due to infinite recursion, either explicit or indirect, such as in GUI programming.",,"The common cause for a stack overflow is a bad recursive call.

62814,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"Mutex work on blocking critical region, But Semaphore work on count.","Mutex blocks a critical region, Semaphore blocks based on a count.",,"Mutex work on blocking critical region, But Semaphore work on count."
62814,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"At a theoretical level, they are no different semantically. You can implement a mutex using semaphores or vice versa (see here for an example). In practice, the implementation is different and they offer slightly different services. The practical difference (in terms of the system services surrounding them) is that the implementation of a mutex is aimed at being a more lightweight synchronisation mechanism. In oracle-speak, mutexes are known as latches and semaphores are known as waits. At the lowest level, they use some sort of atomic test and set mechanism. This reads the current value of a memory location, computes some sort of conditional and writes out a value at that location in a single instruction that cannot be interrupted. This means that you can acquire a mutex and test to see if anyone else had it before you. A typical mutex implementation has a process or thread executing the test-and-set instruction and evaluating whether anything else had set the mutex. A key point here is that there is no interaction with the scheduler, so we have no idea (and don't care) who has set the lock. Then we either give up our time slice and attempt it again when the task is re-scheduled or execute a spin-lock. A spin lock is an algorithm like: When we have finished executing our protected code (known as a critical section) we just set the mutex value to zero or whatever means 'clear.' If multiple tasks are attempting to acquire the mutex they the next task that happens to be scheduled after the mutex is released will get access to the resource. Typically you would use mutexes to control a synchronised resource where exclusive access is only needed for very short periods of time, normally to make an update to a shared data structure. A semaphore is a synchronised data structure (typically using a mutex) that has a count and some system call wrappers that interact with the scheduler in a bit more depth than the mutex libraries would. Semaphores are incremented and decremented and used to block tasks until something else is ready. See Producer/Consumer Problem for a simple example of this. Semaphores are initialised to some value - a binary semaphore is just a special case where the semaphore is initialised to 1. Posting to a semaphore has the effect of waking up a waiting process. A basic semaphore algorithm looks like: In the case of a binary semaphore the main practical difference between the two is the nature of the system services surrounding the actual data structure. EDIT: As evan has rightly pointed out, spinlocks will slow down a single processor machine. You would only use a spinlock on a multi-processor box because on a single processor the process holding the mutex will never reset it while another task is running. Spinlocks are only useful on multi-processor architectures.","At a theoretical level, binary semaphores and mutexes are equivalent. However, in practice, mutexes are a lightweight synchronization mechanism, often implemented using atomic test and set operations, while semaphores are a data structure with a count that interacts with the scheduler to block tasks until they can proceed.",,The practical difference (in terms of the system services surrounding them) is that the implementation of a mutex is aimed at being a more lightweight synchronisation mechanism.

295579,Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer,"It's been pointed out that the last <code>d</code> digits of a perfect square can only take on certain values. The last <code>d</code> digits (in base <code>b</code>) of a number <code>n</code> is the same as the remainder when <code>n</code> is divided by <code>b</code><code>d</code>, ie. in C notation <code>n % pow(b, d)</code>. This can be generalized to any modulus <code>m</code>, ie. <code>n % m</code> can be used to rule out some percentage of numbers from being perfect squares. The modulus you are currently using is 64, which allows 12, ie. 19% of remainders, as possible squares. With a little coding I found the modulus 110880, which allows only 2016, ie. 1.8% of remainders as possible squares. So depending on the cost of a modulus operation (ie. division) and a table lookup versus a square root on your machine, using this modulus might be faster. By the way if Java has a way to store a packed array of bits for the lookup table, don't use it. 110880 32-bit words is not much RAM these days and fetching a machine word is going to be faster than fetching a single bit.","The last d digits of a perfect square can only take on certain values, which can be used to rule out possible squares by checking the remainder of n divided by b^d or m.",,"The last <code>d</code> digits (in base <code>b</code>) of a number <code>n</code> is the same as the remainder when <code>n</code> is divided by <code>b</code><code>d</code>, ie. in C notation <code>n % pow(b, d)</code>. 1.8% of remainders as possible squares.

295579,Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer,"Just for the record, another approach is to use the prime decomposition. If every factor of the decomposition is even, then the number is a perfect square. So what you want is to see if a number can be decomposed as a product of squares of prime numbers. Of course, you don't need to obtain such a decomposition, just to see if it exists. First build a table of squares of prime numbers which are lower than 2^32. This is far smaller than a table of all integers up to this limit. A solution would then be like this: BIGBLOCK I guess it's a bit cryptic. What it does is checking in every step that the square of a prime number divide the input number. If it does then it divides the number by the square as long as it is possible, to remove this square from the prime decomposition.If by this process, we came to 1, then the input number was a decomposition of square of prime numbers. If the square becomes larger than the number itself, then there is no way this square, or any larger squares, can divide it, so the number can not be a decomposition of squares of prime numbers. Given nowadays' sqrt done in hardware and the need to compute prime numbers here, I guess this solution is way slower. But it should give better results than solution with sqrt which won't work over 2^54, as says mrzl in his answer.","Another approach uses prime decomposition to check if a number can be a perfect square, by dividing the number by squares of prime numbers until it reaches 1 or exceeds the original number.",,"If every factor of the decomposition is even, then the number is a perfect square.

When finished, the person   gives (frees) the key to the next   person in the queue. Officially: ""Mutexes are typically   used to serialise access to a section   of  re-entrant code that cannot be   executed concurrently by more than one   thread. A mutex object only allows one   thread into a controlled section,   forcing other threads which attempt to   gain access to that section to wait   until the first thread has exited from   that section."" Ref: Symbian Developer   Library (A mutex is really a semaphore with   value 1.) Semaphore: Is the number of free identical toilet   keys. Example, say we have four   toilets with identical locks and keys.   The semaphore count - the count of   keys - is set to 4 at beginning (all   four toilets are free), then the count   value is decremented as people are   coming in. If all toilets are full,   ie. there are no free keys left, the   semaphore count is 0. Now, when eq.   one person leaves the toilet,   semaphore is increased to 1 (one free   key), and given to the next person in   the queue. Officially: ""A semaphore restricts the   number of simultaneous users of a   shared resource up to a maximum   number. Threads can request access to   the resource (decrementing the   semaphore), and can signal that they   have finished using the resource   (incrementing the semaphore).""

356645,Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.,"It runs successfully the first time,   but if I run it again, I keep getting   a System.OutOfMemoryException. What   are some reasons this could be   happening? Regardless of what the others have said, the error has nothing to do with forgetting to dispose your DBCommand or DBConnection, and you will not fix your error by disposing of either of them. The error has everything to do with your dataset which contains nearly 600,000 rows of data. Apparently your dataset consumes more than 50% of the available memory on your machine. Clearly, you'll run out of memory when you return another dataset of the same size before the first one has been garbage collected. Simple as that. You can remedy this problem in a few ways: Consider returning fewer records. I personally can't imagine a time when returning 600K records has ever been useful to a user. To minimize the records returned, try: Limiting your query to the first 1000 records. If there are more than 1000 results returned from the query, inform the user to narrow their search results. If your users really insist on seeing that much data at once, try paging the data. Remember: Google never shows you all 22 bajillion results of a search at once, it shows you 20 or so records at a time. Google probably doesn't hold all 22 bajillion results in memory at once, it probably finds its more memory efficient to requery its database to generate a new page. If you just need to iterate through the data and you don't need random access, try returning a datareader instead. A datareader only loads one record into memory at a time. If none of those are an option, then you need to force .NET to free up the memory used by the dataset before calling your method using one of these methods: Remove all references to your old dataset. Anything holding on to a refenence of your dataset will prevent it from being reclaimed by memory. If you can't null all the references to your dataset, clear all of the rows from the dataset and any objects bound to those rows instead. This removes references to the datarows and allows them to be eaten by the garbage collector. I don't believe you'll need to call <code>GC.Collect()</code> to force a gen cycle. Not only is it generally a bad idea to call <code>GC.Collect()</code>, because sufficient memory pressure will cause .NET invoke the garbage collector on its own. Note: calling Dispose on your dataset does not free any memory, nor does it invoke the garbage collector, nor does it remove a reference to your dataset. Dispose is used to clean up unmanaged resources, but the DataSet does not have any unmanaged resources. It only implements IDispoable because it inherents from MarshalByValueComponent, so the Dispose method on the dataset is pretty much useless.","A `System.OutOfMemoryException` occurs when a dataset of nearly 600,000 rows consumes too much memory, causing the application to run out of memory.

224664,Difference between proxy server and reverse proxy server,"The previous answers were accurate, but perhaps too terse. I will try to add some examples. First of all, the word ""proxy"" describes someone or something acting on behalf of someone else. In the computer realm, we are talking about one server acting on the behalf of another computer. For the purposes of accessibility, I will limit my discussion to web proxies - however, the idea of a proxy is not limited to websites. FORWARD proxy Most discussion of web proxies refers to the type of proxy known as a ""forward proxy."" The proxy event, in this case, is that the ""forward proxy"" retrieves data from another web site on behalf of the original requestee. A tale of 3 computers (part I) For an example, I will list three computers connected to the internet. X = your computer, or ""client"" computer on the internet Y = the proxy web site, proxy.example.org Z = the web site you want to visit, www.example.net Normally, one would connect directly from <code>X --&gt; Z.</code> However, in some scenarios, it is better for <code>Y --&gt; Z</code> on behalf of <code>X</code>, which chains as follows: <code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code>. Reasons why X would want to use a forward proxy server: Here is a (very) partial list of uses of a forward proxy server. 1) X is unable to access Z directly because a) Someone with administrative authority over <code>X</code>'s internet connection has decided to block all access to site <code>Z</code>. Examples: The Storm Worm virus is spreading by tricking people into visiting <code>familypostcards2008.com</code>, so the system administrator has blocked access to the site to prevent users from inadvertently infecting themselves. Employees at a large company have been wasting too much time on <code>facebook.com</code>, so management wants access blocked during business hours. A local elementary school disallows internet access to the <code>playboy.com</code> website. A government is unable to control the publishing of news, so it controls access to news instead, by blocking sites such as <code>wikipedia.org</code>. See TOR or FreeNet. b) The administrator of <code>Z</code> has blocked <code>X</code>. Examples: The administrator of Z has noticed hacking attempts coming from X, so the administrator has decided to block X's IP address (and/or netrange). Z is a forum website. <code>X</code> is spamming the forum. Z blocks X. REVERSE proxy A tale of 3 computers (part II) For this example, I will list three computers connected to the internet. X = your computer, or ""client"" computer on the internet Y = the reverse proxy web site, proxy.example.com Z = the web site you want to visit, www.example.net Normally, one would connect directly from <code>X --&gt; Z.</code> However, in some scenarios, it is better for the administrator of <code>Z</code> to restrict or disallow direct access and force visitors to go through Y first. So, as before, we have data being retrieved by <code>Y --&gt; Z</code> on behalf of <code>X</code>, which chains as follows: <code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code>. What is different this time compared to a ""forward proxy,"" is that this time the user <code>X</code> does not know he is accessing <code>Z</code>, because the user <code>X</code> only sees he is communicating with <code>Y</code>. The server <code>Z</code> is invisible to clients and only the reverse proxy <code>Y</code> is visible externally. A reverse proxy requires no (proxy) configuration on the client side. The client <code>X</code> thinks he is only communicating with <code>Y</code> (<code>X --&gt; Y</code>), but the reality is that <code>Y</code> forwarding all communication (<code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code> again). Reasons why Z would want to set up a reverse proxy server: 1) Z wants to force all traffic to its web site to pass through Y first. a) Z has a large web site that millions of people want to see, but a single web server cannot handle all the traffic. So Z sets up many servers and puts a reverse proxy on the internet that will send users to the server closest to them when they try to visit Z. This is part of how the Content Distribution Network (CDN) concept works. Examples: Apple Trailers uses Akamai Jquery.com hosts its javascript files using CloudFront CDN (sample). etc. 2) The administrator of Z is worried about retaliation for content hosted on the server and does not want to expose the main server directly to the public. a) Owners of Spam brands such as ""Canadian Pharmacy"" appear to have thousands of servers, while in reality having most websites hosted on far fewer servers. Additionally, abuse complaints about the spam will only shut down the public servers, not the main server. In the above scenarios, <code>Z</code> has the ability to choose <code>Y</code>.

**Reverse Proxy:**
- A reverse proxy server sits between the client (X) and the target website (Z), making Z invisible to the client.

It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript). As stated in the MDN, some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript. An example of  where this is used is web services responses. In the 'old' days, web services used XML as their primary data format for transmitting back data, but since JSON appeared (The JSON format is specified in RFC 4627 by Douglas Crockford), it has been the preferred format because it is much more lightweight You can find a lot more info on the official JSON web site. JSON is built on two structures: A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array. An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence. JSON Structure Here is an example of JSON data: JSON in JavaScript JSON (in Javascript) is a string! People often assume all Javascript objects are JSON and that JSON is a Javascript object. This is incorrect. In Javascript <code>var x = {x:y}</code> is not JSON, this is a Javascript object. The two are not the same thing. The JSON equivalent (represented in the Javascript language) would be <code>var x = '{""x"":""y""}'</code>. <code>x</code> is an object of type string not an object in it's own right. To turn this into a fully fledged Javascript object you must first parse it, <code>var x = JSON.parse('{""x"":""y""}');</code>, <code>x</code> is now an object but this is not JSON anymore. See Javascript object Vs JSON When working with JSON and JavaScript, you may be tempted to use the <code>eval</code> function to evaluate the result returned in the callback, but this is not suggested since there are two characters (U+2028 &amp; U+2029) valid in JSON but not in JavaScript (read more of this here). Therefore, one must always try to use Crockford's script that checks for a valid JSON before evaluating it. Link to the script explanation is found here and here is a direct link to the js file. Every major browser nowadays has its own implementation for this. Example on how to use the JSON parser (with the json from the above code snippet): The JSON parser also offers another very useful method, <code>stringify</code>. This method accepts a JavaScript object as a parameter, and outputs back a string with JSON format. This is useful for when you want to send data back to the server: The above two methods (<code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code>) also take a second parameter, which is a function that will be called for every key and value at every level of the final result, and each value will be replaced by result of your inputted function. (More on this here) Btw, for all of you out there who think JSON is just for JavaScript, check out this post that explains and confirms otherwise.

Your results may vary, especially because I don't know how the Java factor will play out. My approach is threefold: <li>First, filter out obvious answers. This includes negative numbers and looking at the last 4 bits. (I found looking at the last six didn't help.) I also answer yes for 0. (In reading the code below, note that my input is <code>int64 x</code>. )<code>if( x &lt; 0 || (x&2) || ((x & 7) == 5) || ((x & 11) == 8) )    return false;if( x == 0 )    return true;</code> BIGBLOCK <li>Next, check if it's a square modulo 255 = 3 * 5 * 17. Because that's a product of three distinct primes, only about 1/8 of the residues mod 255 are squares. However, in my experience, calling the modulo operator (%) costs more than the benefit one gets, so I use bit tricks involving 255 = 2^8-1 to compute the residue. (For better or worse, I am not using the trick of reading individual bytes out of a word, only bitwise-and and shifts. )<code>int64 y = x;y = (y & 4294967295LL) + (y &gt;&gt; 32); y = (y & 65535) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);y = (y & 255) + ((y &gt;&gt; 8) & 255) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);// At this point, y is between 0 and 511. More code can reduce it farther. BIGBLOCK </code>To actually check if the residue is a square, I look up the answer in a precomputed table.<code>if( bad255[y] )    return false;// However, I just use a table of size 512</code> BIGBLOCK <li>Finally, try to compute the square root using a method similar to Hensel's lemma. (I don't think it's applicable directly, but it works with some modifications.) Before doing that, I divide out all powers of 2 with a binary search:<code>if((x & 4294967295LL) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 32;if((x & 65535) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 16;if((x & 255) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 8;if((x & 15) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 4;if((x & 3) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 2;</code> BIGBLOCK At this point, for our number to be a square, it must be 1 mod 8.<code>if((x & 7) != 1)    return false;</code> BIGBLOCK The basic structure of Hensel's lemma is the following. (Note: untested code; if it doesn't work, try t=2 or 8. )<code>int64 t = 4, r = 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;// Repeat until t is 2^33 or so. Use a loop if you want.</code> BIGBLOCK The idea is that at each iteration, you add one bit onto r, the ""current"" square root of x; each square root is accurate modulo a larger and larger power of 2, namely t/2. At the end, r and t/2-r will be square roots of x modulo t/2. (Note that if r is a square root of x, then so is -r.  This is true even modulo numbers, but beware, modulo some numbers, things can have even more than 2 square roots; notably, this includes powers of 2.) Because our actual square root is less than 2^32, at that point we can actually just check if r or t/2-r are real square roots. In my actual code, I use the following modified loop:<code>int64 r, t, z;r = start[(x &gt;&gt; 3) & 1023];do {    z = x - r * r;    if( z == 0 )        return true;    if( z &lt; 0 )        return false;    t = z & (-z);    r += (z & t) &gt;&gt; 1;    if( r &gt; (t &gt;&gt; 1) )        r = t - r;} while( t &lt;= (1LL &lt;&lt; 33) );</code> BIGBLOCK The speedup here is obtained in three ways: precomputed start value (equivalent to ~10 iterations of the loop), earlier exit of the loop, and skipping some t values. For the last part, I look at <code>z = r - x * x</code>, and set t to be the largest power of 2 dividing z with a bit trick. This allows me to skip t values that wouldn't have affected the value of r anyway. The precomputed start value in my case picks out the ""smallest positive"" square root modulo 8192. Even if this code doesn't work faster for you, I hope you enjoy some of the ideas it contains. Complete, tested code follows, including the precomputed tables.

432763,What's the difference between fill_parent and wrap_content?,Either attribute can be applied to View's (visual control) horizontal or vertical size. It's used to set a View or Layouts size based on either it's contents or the size of it's parent layout rather than explicitly specifying a dimension. <strong><code>fill_parent</code></strong> (deprecated and renamed <code>MATCH_PARENT</code> in API Level 8 and higher) Setting the layout of a widget to fill_parent will force it to expand to take up as much space as is available within the layout element it's been placed in. It's roughly equivalent of setting the dockstyle of a Windows Form Control to <code>Fill</code>. Setting a top level layout or control to fill_parent will force it to take up the whole screen. <strong><code>wrap_content</code></strong> Setting a View's size to wrap_content will force it to expand only far enough to contain the values (or child controls) it contains. For controls -- like text boxes (TextView) or images (ImageView) -- this will wrap the text or image being shown. For layout elements it will resize the layout to fit the controls / layouts added as its children. It's roughly the equivalent of setting a Windows Form Control's <code>Autosize</code> property to True. <strong>Online Documentation</strong> There's some details in the Android code documentation here.,"`fill_parent` (deprecated, equivalent to `MATCH_PARENT` in API Level 8+) and `wrap_content` are layout attributes that determine a View's size based on its content or parent layout.

Just use the each_slice method and flatten the hash. Less monkey-patching required. However, this does cause problems when you have a recursive array or a hash with array values. In ruby 1.9 this problem is solved with a parameter to the flatten method that specifies how deep to recurse. As for the question of whether this is a code smell, I'm not sure.

75191,What is an unsigned char?,"Because i feel it's really called for, i just want to state some rules of C and C++ (they are the same in this regard). First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object. Second, <code>unsigned char</code> is explicitly stated unsigned. Now, i had a discussion with someone about what happens when you convert the value <code>-1</code> of type int to <code>unsigned char</code>. He refused the idea that the resulting <code>unsigned char</code> has all its bits set to 1, because he was worried about sign representation. But he don't have to. It's immediately following out of this rule that the conversion does what is intended: If the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or   subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type   until the value is in the range of the new type. (<code>6.3.1.3p2</code> in a C99 draft) That's a mathematical description. C++ describes it in terms of modulo calculus, which yields to the same rule. Anyway, what is not guaranteed is that all bits in the integer <code>-1</code> are one before the conversion. So, what do we have so we can claim that the resulting <code>unsigned char</code> has all its <code>CHAR_BIT</code> bits turned to 1? All bits participate in determining its value - that is, no padding bits occur in the object. Adding only one time <code>UCHAR_MAX+1</code> to <code>-1</code> will yield a value in range, namely <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> That's enough, actually! So whenever you want to have an <code>unsigned char</code> having all its bits one, you do It also follows that a conversion is not just truncating higher order bits. The fortunate event for two's complement is that it is just a truncation there, but the same isn't necessarily true for other sign representations.","An `unsigned char` in C/C++ has all its bits participating in determining its value and is explicitly unsigned. When converting an `int` value to `unsigned char`, the value is adjusted to fit the new range by adding or subtracting the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until it's within range.",,"First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object.

You will need to verify with your particular DBMS help documentation for specifics. As I am most familiar with SQL Server I will use that as my samples. To create a stored procedure the syntax is fairly simple: So for example: A benefit of stored procedures is that you can centralize data access logic into a single place that is then easy for DBA's to optimize. Stored procedures also have a security benefit in that you can grant execute rights to a stored procedure but the user will not need to have read/write permissions on the underlying tables. This is a good first step against SQL injection. Stored procedures do come with downsides, basically the maintenance associated with your basic CRUD operation. Let's say for each table you have an Insert, Update, Delete and at least one select based on the primary key, that means each table will have 4 procedures. Now take a decent size database of 400 tables, and you have 1600 procedures! And that's assuming you don't have duplicates which you probably will. This is where using an ORM or some other method to auto generate your basic CRUD operations has a ton of merit.","Stored procedures are a batch of SQL statements that can be executed, providing centralized data access and security benefits, but may require maintenance and can lead to a large number of procedures in a large database.",,Stored procedures are a batch of SQL statements that can be executed in a couple of ways.

461203,When to use virtual destructors?,"Virtual destructors are useful when you can delete an instance of a derived class through a pointer to base class: Here, you'll notice that I didn't declare Base's destructor to be <code>virtual</code>. Now, let's have a look at the following snippet: Since Base's destructor is not <code>virtual</code> and <code>b</code> is a <code>Base*</code> pointing to a <code>Derived</code> object, <code>delete b</code> has undefined behaviour: [In <code>delete b</code>], if the static type of the  object to be deleted is different from its dynamic type, the static  type shall be a base class of the dynamic type of the object to be  deleted and <strong>the static type shall have a virtual destructor or the  behavior is undefined</strong>. In most implementations, the call to the destructor will be resolved like any non-virtual code, meaning that the destructor of the base class will be called but not the one of the derived class, resulting in a resources leak. To sum up, always make base classes' destructors <code>virtual</code> when they're meant to be manipulated polymorphically. If you want to prevent the deletion of an instance through a base class pointer, you can make the base class destructor protected and nonvirtual; by doing so, the compiler won't let you call <code>delete</code> on a base class pointer.

487258,"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?","EDIT: Quick note, this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation (which is both an upper and lower bound). In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. In one sentence: As the size of your job goes up, how much longer does it take to complete it? Obviously that's only using ""size"" as the input and ""time taken"" as the output &mdash; the same idea applies if you want to talk about memory usage etc. Here's an example where we have N T-shirts which we want to dry. We'll <em>assume</em> it's incredibly quick to get them in the drying position (i.e. the human interaction is negligible). That's not the case in real life, of course... <li>Using a washing line outside: assuming you have an infinitely large back yard, washing dries in O(1) time. However much you have of it, it'll get the same sun and fresh air, so the size doesn't affect the drying time. <li>Using a tumble dryer: you put 10 shirts in each load, and then they're done an hour later. (Ignore the actual numbers here &mdash; they're irrelevant.) So drying 50 shirts takes <em>about</em> 5 times as long as drying 10 shirts. <li>Putting everything in an airing cupboard: If we put everything in one big pile and just let general warmth do it, it will take a long time for the middle shirts to get dry. I wouldn't like to guess at the detail, but I suspect this is at least O(N^2) &mdash; as you increase the wash load, the drying time increases faster. One important aspect of ""big O"" notation is that it <em>doesn't</em> say which algorithm will be faster for a given size. Take a hashtable (string key, integer value)  vs an array of pairs (string, integer). Is it faster to find a key in the hashtable or an element in the array, based on a string? (i.e. for the array, ""find the first element where the string part matches the given key."") Hashtables are generally amortised (~= ""on average"") O(1) &mdash; once they're set up, it should take about the same time to find an entry in a 100 entry table as in a 1,000,000 entry table. Finding an element in an array (based on content rather than index) is linear, i.e. O(N) &mdash; on average, you're going to have to look at half the entries. Does this make a hashtable faster than an array for lookups? Not necessarily. If you've got a very small collection of entries, an array may well be faster &mdash; you may be able to check all the strings in the time that it takes to just calculate the hashcode of the one you're looking at. As the data set grows larger, however, the hashtable will eventually beat the array.","Big O notation measures how long an algorithm takes to complete as its input size increases, with O(1) meaning constant time, O(N) meaning time increases linearly with the input size, and O(N^2) meaning time increases quadratically with the input size.",,"In one sentence: As the size of your job goes up, how much longer does it take to complete it?

In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: The simplest definition I can give for Big-O notation is this: <strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> There are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence: <li><strong>relative:</strong> you can only compare apples to apples. You can't compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers. But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful; <li><strong>representation:</strong> Big-O (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable. That variable is chosen based on observations or assumptions. For example, sorting algorithms are typically compared based on comparison operations (comparing two nodes to determine their relative ordering). This assumes that comparison is expensive. But what if comparison is cheap but swapping is expensive? It changes the comparison; and <li><strong>complexity:</strong> if it takes me one second to sort 10,000 elements how long will it take me to sort one million? Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else. Come back and reread the above when you've read the rest. The best example of Big-O I can think of is doing arithmetic. Take two numbers (123456 and 789012). The basic arithmetic operations we learnt in school were: <li>addition; <li>subtraction; <li>multiplication; and <li>division. Each of these is an operation or a problem. A method of solving these is called an <strong>algorithm</strong>. Addition is the simplest. You line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition in the result. The 'tens' part of that number is carried over to the next column. Let's assume that the addition of these numbers is the most expensive operation in this algorithm. It stands to reason that to add these two numbers together we have to add together 6 digits (and possibly carry a 7th). If we add two 100 digit numbers together we have to do 100 additions. If we add <strong>two</strong> 10,000 digit numbers we have to do 10,000 additions. See the pattern? The <strong>complexity</strong> (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits <em>n</em> in the larger number. We call this <strong>O(n)</strong> or <strong>linear complexity</strong>. Subtraction is similar (except you may need to borrow instead of carry). Multiplication is different. You line the numbers up, take the first digit in the bottom number and multiply it in turn against each digit in the top number and so on through each digit. So to multiply our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplications. We may need to do as many as 10 or 11 column adds to get the end result too. If we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10,000 multiplications and 200 adds. For two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (1012) multiplications and two million adds. As the algorithm scales with n-<em>squared</em>, this is <strong>O(n2)</strong> or <strong>quadratic complexity</strong>. This is a good time to introduce another important concept: <strong>We only care about the most significant portion of complexity.</strong> The astute may have realized that we could express the number of operations as: n2 + 2n. But as you saw from our example with two numbers of a million digits apiece, the second term (2n) becomes insignificant (accounting for 0.0002% of the total operations by that stage). One can notice that we've assumed the worst case scenario here. While multiplying 6 digit numbers if one of them is 4 digit and the other one is 6 digit, then we only have 24 multiplications. Still we calculate the worst case scenario for that 'n', i.e when both are 6 digit numbers. Hence Big-O notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm The Telephone Book The next best example I can think of is the telephone book, normally called the White Pages or similar but it'll vary from country to country. But I'm talking about the one that lists people by surname and then initials or first name, possibly address and then telephone numbers. Now if you were instructing a computer to look up the phone number for ""John Smith"" in a telephone book that contains 1,000,000 names, what would you do? Ignoring the fact that you could guess how far in the S's started (let's assume you can't), what would you do? A typical implementation might be to open up to the middle, take the 500,000th and compare it to ""Smith"". If it happens to be ""Smith, John"", we just got real lucky. Far more likely is that ""John Smith"" will be before or after that name. If it's after we then divide the last half of the phone book in half and repeat. If it's before then we divide the first half of the phone book in half and repeat. And so on. This is called a <strong>binary search</strong> and is used every day in programming whether you realize it or not. So if you want to find a name in a phone book of a million names you can actually find any name by doing this at most 20 times. In comparing search algorithms we decide that this comparison is our 'n'. <li>For a phone book of 3 names it takes 2 comparisons (at most). <li>For 7 it takes at most 3. <li>For 15 it takes 4. <li>For 1,000,000 it takes 20. That is staggeringly good isn't it? In Big-O terms this is <strong>O(log n)</strong> or <strong>logarithmic complexity</strong>. Now the logarithm in question could be ln (base e), log10, log2 or some other base. It doesn't matter it's still O(log n) just like O(2n2) and O(100n2) are still both O(n2). It's worthwhile at this point to explain that Big O can be used to determine three cases with an algorithm: <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> In the telephone book search, the best case is that we find the name in one comparison. This is <strong>O(1)</strong> or <strong>constant complexity</strong>; <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> As discussed above this is O(log n); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> This is also O(log n). Normally we don't care about the best case. We're interested in the expected and worst case. Sometimes one or the other of these will be more important. Back to the telephone book. What if you have a phone number and want to find a name? The police have a reverse phone book but such look-ups are denied to the general public. Or are they? Technically you can reverse look-up a number in an ordinary phone book. How? You start at the first name and compare the number. If it's a match, great, if not, you move on to the next. You have to do it this way because the phone book is <strong>unordered</strong> (by phone number anyway). So to find a name given the phone number (reverse lookup): <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> O(1); <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> O(n) (for 500,000); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> O(n) (for 1,000,000). The Travelling Salesman This is quite a famous problem in computer science and deserves a mention. In this problem you have N towns. Each of those towns is linked to 1 or more other towns by a road of a certain distance. The Travelling Salesman problem is to find the shortest tour that visits every town. Sounds simple? Think again. If you have 3 towns A, B and C with roads between all pairs then you could go: So the Big-O of the Travelling Salesman problem is <strong>O(n! )</strong> or <strong>factorial or combinatorial complexity</strong>. <strong>By the time you get to 200 towns there isn't enough time left in the universe to solve the problem with traditional computers.</strong> Something to think about. Polynomial Time Another point I wanted to make quick mention of is that any algorithm that has a complexity of <strong>O(na)</strong> is said to have <strong>polynomial complexity</strong> or is solvable in <strong>polynomial time</strong>. O(n), O(n2) etc are all polynomial time. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time. Certain things are used in the world because of this. Public Key Cryptography is a prime example. It is computationally hard to find two prime factors of a very large number. If it wasn't, we couldn't use the public key systems we use. Anyway, that's it for my (hopefully plain English) explanation of Big O (revised).",,Apologies for any confusion caused. Each of these is an operation or a problem. One can notice that we've assumed the worst case scenario here. How? Something to think about. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time.,"Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: <strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> You can't compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers. But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful; Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else."

487258,"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?","<strong>Big O describes the fundamental scaling nature of an algorithm.</strong> There is a lot of information that Big O does not tell you about a given algorithm. It cuts to the bone and gives only information about the scaling nature of an algorithm, specifically how the resource use (think time or memory) of an algorithm scales in response to the ""input size"". Consider the difference between a steam engine and a rocket. They are not merely different varieties of the same thing (as, say, a Prius engine vs. a Lamborghini engine) but they are dramatically different kinds of propulsion systems, at their core. A steam engine may be faster than a toy rocket, but no steam piston engine will be able to achieve the speeds of an orbital launch vehicle. This is because these systems have different scaling characteristics with regards to the relation of fuel required (""resource usage"") to reach a given speed (""input size""). Why is this so important? Because software deals with problems that may differ in size by factors up to a trillion. Consider that for a moment. The ratio between the speed necessary to travel to the Moon and human walking speed is less than 10,000:1, and that is absolutely tiny compared to the range in input sizes software may face. And because software may face an astronomical range in input sizes there is the potential for the Big O complexity of an algorithm, it's fundamental scaling nature, to trump any implementation details. Consider the canonical sorting example. Bubble-sort is O(n2) while merge-sort is O(n log n). Let's say you have two sorting applications, application A which uses bubble-sort and application B which uses merge-sort, and let's say that for input sizes of around 30 elements application A is 1,000x faster than application B at sorting. If you never have to sort much more than 30 elements then it's obvious that you should prefer application A, as it is much faster at these input sizes. However, if you find that you may have to sort ten million items then what you'd expect is that application B actually ends up being thousands of times faster than application A in this case, entirely due to the way each algorithm scales.","Big O notation describes how an algorithm's resource use (time or memory) scales with input size, giving insight into its fundamental nature and performance characteristics, crucial for choosing efficient algorithms when dealing with large input sizes.",,"<strong>Big O describes the fundamental scaling nature of an algorithm.</strong> It cuts to the bone and gives only information about the scaling nature of an algorithm, specifically how the resource use (think time or memory) of an algorithm scales in response to the ""input size"".

I mean, a view is effectively based off of what could be thought of as one or more database views, right? There might be connections between rows in different views. Alternatively, we can talk object-oriented instead of relational, but that actually doesn't change anything -- we still have one or more distinct data entities. If we view programming as data structures + algorithms, then wouldn't it be best to have the data structures made explicit as possible, and then develop algorithms that each depend on as small a piece of data as possible, with minimal coupling between the algorithms? I sense very Java-esque FactoryFactoryFactory thought patterns here -- we want to have multiple views, multiple models, multiple degrees of freedom all over the place. It's almost like that is the driving force behind MVC and MVP and whatnot. Now let me ask this: how often is the cost you pay for this (and there most definitely is a cost) worth it?

The chain consists of other objects. The prototype of a given instance can be accessed with the <code>__proto__</code> variable. Every object has one, as there is no difference between classes and instances in javascript. The advantage of adding a function / variable to the prototype is that it has to be in the memory only once, not for every instance. It's also useful for inheritance, because the prototype chain can consist of many other objects.","Javascript uses a prototype chain to inherit properties, where an object's properties are searched in its own object and then in its prototype chain.",,"The advantage of adding a function / variable to the prototype is that it has to be in the memory only once, not for every instance."
572897,How does JavaScript .prototype work?,"Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]]. If you look up a property via <code>obj.propName</code> or <code>obj['propName']</code> and the object does not have such a property - which can be checked via <code>obj.hasOwnProperty('propName')</code> - the runtime looks up the property in the object referenced by [[Prototype]] instead. If the prototype-object also doesn't have such a property, its prototype is checked in turn, thus walking the original object's prototype-chain until a match is found or its end is reached. Some JavaScript implementations allow direct access to the [[Prototype]] property, eg via a non-standard property named <code>__proto__</code>. In general, it's only possible to set an object's prototype during object creation: If you create a new object via <code>new Func()</code>, the object's [[Prototype]] property will be set to the object referenced by <code>Func.prototype</code>. This allows to simulate classes in JavaScript, although JavaScript's inheritance system is - as we have seen - prototypical, and not class-based: Just think of constructor functions as classes and the properties of the prototype (ie of the object referenced by the constructor function's <code>prototype</code> property) as shared members, ie members which are the same for each instance. In class-based systems, methods are implemented the same way for each instance, so methods are normally added to the prototype, whereas an object's fields are instance-specific and therefore added to the object itself during construction.","Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]] which serves as a fallback for missing properties, and is set during object creation, allowing for prototypical inheritance similar to classes.",,"Just think of constructor functions as classes and the properties of the prototype (ie of the object referenced by the constructor function's <code>prototype</code> property) as shared members, ie members which are the same for each instance."

597588,How do you clone an Array of Objects in Javascript?,"The issue with your shallow copy is that all the objects aren't cloned. While the references to each object are unique in each array, once you ultimately grab onto it you're dealing with the same object as before. There is nothing wrong with the way you cloned it...  the same result would occur using Array.slice(). The reason your deep copy is having problems is because you're ending up with circular object references. Deep will go as deep as it can go, and if you've got a circle, it'll keep going infinitely until the browser faints. If the data structure cannot be represented as a directed acyclic graph, then I'm not sure you're going to be able to find an all-purpose method for deep cloning. Cyclic graphs provide many tricky corner cases, and since it's not a common operation I doubt anyone has written a full solution (if it's even possible - it might not be! But I have no time to try to write a rigorous proof now.). I found some good comments on the issue on this page. If you need a deep copy of an Array of Objects with circular references I believe you're going to have to code your own method to handle your specialized data structure, such that it is a multi-pass clone: <li>On round one, make a clone of all objects that don't reference other objects in the array.

597588,How do you clone an Array of Objects in Javascript?,"As Daniel Lew mentioned, cyclic graphs have some problems. If I had this problem I'd either add special <code>clone()</code> methods to the problematic objects or remember which objects I've already copied. I'd do it with a variable <code>copyCount</code> which increases by 1 every time you copy in your code. An object that has a lower <code>copyCount</code> than the current copy-process is copied. If not, the copy, that exists already, should be referenced. This makes it necessary to link from the original to its copy. There is still one problem: Memory. If you have this reference from one object to the other, it's likely that the browser can't free those objects, as they are always referenced from somewhere. You'd have to make a second pass where you set all copy-references to Null. (If you do this, you'd not have to have a <code>copyCount</code> but a boolean <code>isCopied</code> would be enough, as you can reset the value in the second pass.)","Cloning an array of objects in JavaScript can be problematic for cyclic graphs.

614818,"What is the difference between public, private, protected, and having no access modifier?","Hmm. See here:  Access Modifiers. In a nutshell: Public gives the method or type complete visibility from other types/classes. Private allows only the type containing the private method/variable access to the private method/variable (note that nested classes  also have access to the containing classes private methods/variables). Protected is similar to private except derived classes can also access protected methods. ""Nothing"" is VB.NET's equivalent to null. Although if you're referring to ""nothing"" meaning ""no access modifier"", then it depends, although a very rough rule of thumb (certainly in C#) is that if you don't explicitly specify an access modifier, the method/variable declaration is usually as <em>restricted</em> as it can be.i.e. is effectively the same as: The linked MSDN article will offer a fully description when there's no access modifier explicitly specified.","Public gives full visibility, Private is accessible within the same class, Protected is accessible within the same class and derived classes, and no access modifier (default) is similar to Private.",,"In a nutshell: Public gives the method or type complete visibility from other types/classes.

A static member has one version regardless of how many instances of its enclosing type are created. A static class is basically the same as a non-static class, but there is one difference: a static class cannot be externally instantiated. In other words, you cannot use the new keyword to create a variable of the class type. Because there is no instance variable, you access the members of a static class by using the class name itself. However, there is a such thing as a static constructor. Any class can have one of these, including static classes. They cannot be called directly &amp; cannot have parameters (other than any type parameters on the class itself).

295579,Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer,"The sqrt call is not perfectly accurate, as has been mentioned, but it's interesting and instructive that it doesn't blow away the other answers in terms of speed. After all, the sequence of assembly language instructions for a sqrt is tiny. Intel has a hardware instruction, which isn't used by Java I believe because it doesn't conform to IEEE. So why is it slow? Because Java is actually calling a C routine through JNI, and it's actually slower to do so than to call a Java subroutine, which itself is slower than doing it inline. This is very annoying, and Java should have come up with a better solution, ie building in floating point library calls if necessary. Oh well. In C++, I suspect all the complex alternatives would lose on speed, but I haven't checked them all.What I did, and what Java people will find usefull, is a simple hack, an extension of the special case testing suggested by A. Rex. Use a single long value as a bit array, which isn't bounds checked. That way, you have 64 bit boolean lookup. BIGBLOCK The routine isPerfectSquare5 runs in about 1/3 the time on my core2 duo machine. I suspect that further tweaks along the same lines could reduce the time further on average, but every time you check, you are trading off more testing for more eliminating, so you can't go too much farther on that road. Certainly, rather than having a separate test for negative, you could check the high 6 bits the same way. Note that all I'm doing is eliminating possible squares, but when I have a potential case I have to call the original, inlined isPerfectSquare. The init2 routine is called once to initialize the static values of pp1 and pp2.Note that in my implementation in C++, I'm using unsigned long long, so since you're signed, you'd have to use the >>> operator. There is no intrinsic need to bounds check the array, but Java's optimizer has to figure this stuff out pretty quickly, so I don't blame them for that.","A simple hack to determine if an integer's square root is an integer uses a single long value as a bit array, eliminating possible squares and calling a separate isPerfectSquare function for potential cases, reducing execution time to about 1/3 compared to the original method.",,"The sqrt call is not perfectly accurate, as has been mentioned, but it's interesting and instructive that it doesn't blow away the other answers in terms of speed.

592620,How to check if a program exists from a Bash script?,"Answer POSIX compatible: For <code>bash</code> specific environments: Explanation Avoid <code>which</code>. Not only is it an external process you're launching for doing very little (meaning builtins like <code>hash</code>, <code>type</code> or <code>command</code> are way cheaper), you can also rely on the builtins to actually do what you want, while the effects of external commands can easily vary from system to system. Why care? Many operating systems have a <code>which</code> that doesn't even set an exit status, meaning the <code>if which foo</code> won't even work there and will always report that <code>foo</code> exists, even if it doesn't (note that some POSIX shells appear to do this for <code>hash</code> too). Many operating systems make <code>which</code> do custom and evil stuff like change the output or even hook into the package manager. So, don't use <code>which</code>. Instead use one of these: (Minor side-note: some will suggest <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> is the same <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code> but shorter Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?this is untrue. <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> closes FD 2 which causes an error in the program when it tries to write to stderr, which is very different from successfully writing to it and discarding the output (and dangerous!)) If your hash bang is <code>/bin/sh</code> then you should care about what POSIX says. <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code>'s exit codes aren't terribly well defined by POSIX, and <code>hash</code> is seen to exit successfully when the command doesn't exist (haven't seen this with <code>type</code> yet). <code>command</code>'s exit status is well defined by POSIX, so that one is probably the safest to use. If your script uses <code>bash</code> though, POSIX rules don't really matter anymore and both <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code> become perfectly safe to use. <code>type</code> now has a <code>-P</code> to search just the <code>PATH</code> and <code>hash</code> has the side-effect that the command's location will be hashed (for faster lookup next time you use it), which is usually a good thing since you probably check for its existence in order to actually use it. As a simple example, here's a function that runs <code>gdate</code> if it exists, otherwise <code>date</code>:","Avoid using `which` and instead use `type`, `hash`, or `command` to check if a program exists in a Bash script, with `command` being the safest option for POSIX compatibility.",,POSIX compatible: For <code>bash</code> specific environments:

Most of the optimizations mentioned above don't work easily when you are working with an 80 byte buffer. I used java BigInteger and a slightly modified version of Newton's method, one that works better with integers. The problem was that exact squares n^2 converged to (n-1) instead of n because n^2-1 = (n-1)(n+1) and the final error was just one step below the final divisor and the algorithm terminated. It was easy to fix by adding one to the original argument before computing the error. (Add two for cube roots, etc.) One nice attribute of this algorithm is that you can immediately tell if the number is a perfect square - the final error (not correction) in Newton's method will be zero. A simple modification also lets you quickly calculate floor(sqrt(x)) instead of the closest integer.

310634,"What is the ""right"" way to iterate through an array in Ruby?","I'm not saying that <code>Array</code> -> <code>|value,index|</code> and <code>Hash</code> -> <code>|key,value|</code> is not insane (see Horace Loeb's comment), but I am saying that there is a sane way to expect this arrangement. When I am dealing with arrays, I am focused on the elements in the array (not the index because the index is transitory). The method is each with index, i.e. each+index, or |each,index|, or <code>|value,index|</code>. This is also consistent with the index being viewed as an optional argument, e.g. |value| is equivalent to |value,index=nil| which is consistent with |value,index|. When I am dealing with hashes, I am often more focused on the keys than the values, and I am usually dealing with keys and values in that order, either <code>key =&gt; value</code> or <code>hash[key] = value</code>. If you want duck-typing, then either explicitly use a defined method as Brent Longborough showed, or an implicit method as maxhawkins showed. Ruby is all about accommodating the language to suit the programmer, not about the programmer accommodating to suit the language. This is why there are so many ways.

You can do (for symmetry): and which I don't like much, but you can't do You could ultimately do but I want to teach pure Ruby rather than object oriented approaches (just yet). I would like to iterate backwards: without creating an array (consider 0..1000000000) working for any Range (e.g. Strings, not just Integers) without using any extra object oriented power (i.e. no class modification) I believe this is impossible without defining a <code>pred</code> method, which means modifying the Range class to use it.

Let's break that down. In the simplest case, an enumeration can be declared as This declares an enumeration with the tag <code>tagname</code>. In C and Objective-C (but not C++), any references to this must be preceded with the <code>enum</code> keyword. For example: In order to avoid having to use the <code>enum</code> keyword everywhere, a typedef can be created: This can be simplified into one line: And finally, if we don't need to be able to use <code>enum tagname</code> with the <code>enum</code> keyword, we can make the <code>enum</code> anonymous and only declare it with the typedef name: Now, in this case, we're declaring <code>ShapeType</code> to be a typedef'ed name of an anonymous enumeration. <code>ShapeType</code> is really just an integral type, and should only be used to declare variables which hold one of the values listed in the declaration (that is, one of <code>kCircle</code>, <code>kRectangle</code>, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code>). You can assign a <code>ShapeType</code> variable another value by casting, though, so you have to be careful when reading enum values. Finally, <code>kCircle</code>, <code>kRectangle</code>, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code> are declared as integral constants in the global namespace. Since no specific values were specified, they get assigned to consecutive integers starting with 0, so <code>kCircle</code> is 0, <code>kRectangle</code> is 1, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code> is 2.","A `typedef enum` in Objective-C is used to declare an enumerated type, with a name and integral constants representing the values.

544010,Difference between div id and div class,"Where to use an ID versus a class The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. Therefore, it is appropriate to use an ID on the div element that is marking up the main content on the page, as there will only be one main content section. In contrast, you must use a class to set up alternating row colors on a table, as they are by definition going to be used more than once. IDs are an incredibly powerful tool. An element with an ID can be the target of a piece of JavaScript that manipulates the element or its contents in some way. The ID attribute can be used as the target of an internal link, replacing anchor tags with name attributes. Finally, if you make your IDs clear and logical, they can serve as a sort of Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦Â¸Âelf documentationÃ©Â?within the document.

722651,How do I pass multiple parameters in Objective-C?,"Yes; the Objective-C method syntax is like this for a couple of reasons; one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying are. For example, if you are adding an object to an <code>NSMutableArray</code> at a certain index, you would do it using the method: BIGBLOCK This method is called <code>insertObject:atIndex:</code> and it is clear that an object is being inserted at a specified index. In practice, adding a string ""Hello, World!"" at index 5 of an <code>NSMutableArray</code> called <code>array</code> would be called as follows: BIGBLOCK This also reduces ambiguity between the order of the method parameters, ensuring that you pass the object parameter first, <em>then</em> the index parameter. This becomes more useful when using functions that take a large number of arguments, and reduces error in passing the arguments. Furthermore, the method naming convention is such because Objective-C doesn't support overloading; however, if you want to write a method that does the same job, but takes different data-types, this can be accomplished; take, for instance, the <code>NSNumber</code> class; this has several object creation methods, including: <li><code>+ (id)numberWithBool:(BOOL)value;</code> <li><code>+ (id)numberWithFloat:(float)value;</code> <li><code>+ (id)numberWithDouble:(double)value;</code> In a language such as C++, you would simply overload the number method to allow different data types to be passed as the argument; however, in Objective-C, this syntax allows several different variants of the same function to be implemented, by changing the name of the method for each variant of the function.","Objective-C method parameters are specified clearly, one by one, to avoid ambiguity and reduce errors, especially for methods with many arguments.",,"Yes; the Objective-C method syntax is like this for a couple of reasons; one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying are.

However, you do have a couple of options: Return a structure that contains multiple members Return an instance of a class Use output parameters (using the out or ref keywords) Use a dictionary or key-value pair as output The pros and cons here are often hard to figure out. If you return a structure, make sure it's small because structs are value type and passed on the stack. If you return an instance of a class, there are some design patterns here that you might want to use to avoid causing problems - members of classes can be modified because C# passes objects by reference (you don't have ByVal like you did in VB). Finally you can use output parameters but I would limit the use of this to scenarios when you only have a couple (like 3 or less) of parameters - otherwise things get ugly and hard to maintain. Also, the use of output parameters can be an inhibitor to agility because your method signature will have to change every time you need to add something to the return value whereas returning a struct or class instance you can add members without modifying the method signature. From an architectural standpoint I would recommend against using key-value pairs or dictionaries. I find this style of coding requires ""secret knowledge"" in code that consumes the method. It must know ahead of time what the keys are going to be and what the values mean and if the developer working on the internal implementation changes the way the dictionary or KVP is created, it could easily create a failure cascade throughout the entire application.","You can return multiple values from a C# function by using one of the following options:

761194,Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO),"There are a couple of other differences - Interfaces can't have any concrete implementations. Abstract base classes can. This allows you to provide concrete implementations there. This can allow an abstract base class to actually provide a more rigorous contract, wheras an interface really only describes how a class is used. (The abstract base class can have non-virtual members defining the behavior, which gives more control to the base class author.) More than one interface can be implemented on a class. A class can only derive from a single abstract base class. This allows for polymorphic hierarchy using interfaces, but not abstract base classes. This also allows for a pseudo-multi-inheritance using interfaces. Abstract base classes can be modified in v2+ without breaking the API. Changes to interfaces are breaking changes. [C#/.NET Specific] Interfaces, unlike abstract base classes, can be applied to value types (structs). Structs cannot inherit from abstract base classes.

- Interfaces are less prone to breaking changes, while Abstract Classes are more flexible.
- Interfaces can be applied to value types (structs), but Abstract Classes can't.",,Interfaces can't have any concrete implementations. Abstract base classes can. More than one interface can be implemented on a class. A class can only derive from a single abstract base class. Abstract base classes can be modified in v2+ without breaking the API. Changes to interfaces are breaking changes.
761194,Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO),"For .Net, Your answer to The second interviewer is also the answer to the first one... Abstract classes can have implementation, AND state, interfaces cannot... EDIT:   On another note, I wouldn't even use the phrase 'subclass' (or the 'inheritance' phrase) to describe classes that are 'defined to implement' an interface. To me, an interface is a definition of a contract that a class must conform to if it has been defined to 'implement' that interface. It does not inherit anything... You have to add everything yourself, explicitly.","For .Net, abstract classes can have implementation and state, while interfaces cannot.",,"Your answer to The second interviewer is also the answer to the first one...

761194,Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO),"The interviewers are barking up an odd tree. For languages like C# and Java, there is a difference, but in other languages like C++ there is not. OO theory doesn't differentiate the two, merely the syntax of language. An abstract class is a class with both implementation and interface (pure virtual methods) that will be inherited. Interfaces generally do not have any implementation but only pure virtual functions. In C# or Java an abstract class without any implementation differs from an interface only in the syntax used to inherit from it and the fact you can only inherit from one.","OO theory doesn't differentiate interfaces and abstract classes, only the syntax of the language does.",,"For languages like C# and Java, there is a difference, but in other languages like C++ there is not.

761194,Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO),"1) An interface can be seen as a pure Abstract Class, is the same, but despite this, is not the same to implement an interface and inheriting from an abstract class. When you inherit from this pure abstract class you are defining a hierarchy -> inheritance, if you implement the interface you are not, and you can implement as many interfaces as you want, but you can only inherit from one class. 2) You can define a property in an interface, so the class that implements that interface must have that property. For example: The class that implements that interface must have a property like that.","An interface can be seen as a pure abstract class, but implementing an interface is different from inheriting from an abstract class, allowing multiple implementations and properties.",,"1) An interface can be seen as a pure Abstract Class, is the same, but despite this, is not the same to implement an interface and inheriting from an abstract class."

761194,Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO),"While your question indicates it's for ""general OO"", it really seems to be focusing on .NET use of these terms. In .NET (similar for Java): <li>interfaces can have no state or implementation <li>a class that implements an interface must provide an implementation of all the methods of that interface <li>abstract classes may contain state (data members) and/or implementation (methods) <li>abstract classes can be inherited without implementing the abstract methods (though such a derived class is abstract itself) <li>interfaces may be multiple-inherited, abstract classes may not (this is probably the key concrete reason for interfaces to exist separately from abtract classes - they permit an implementation of multiple inheritance that removes many of the problems of general MI). As general OO terms, the differences are not necessarily well-defined. For example, there are C++ programmers who may hold similar rigid definitions (interfaces are a strict subset of abstract classes that cannot contain implementation), while some may say that an abstract class with some default implementations is still an interface or that a non-abstract class can still define an interface. Indeed, there is a C++ idiom called the Non-Virtual Interface (NVI) where  the public methods are non-virtual methods that 'thunk' to private virtual methods: <li>http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm <li>http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Non-Virtual_Interface","In .NET, the key differences between interfaces and abstract classes are:

Example: BIGBLOCK Notice how the function has a return clause between the parameter list and the ""as"" keyword.

771949,What is the difference between function and procedure in PL/SQL?,"A function can be in-lined into a SQL statement, e.g. BIGBLOCK Which cannot be done with a stored procedure. The architecture of the query optimiser limits what can be done with functions in this context, requiring that they are pure (i.e. the same inputs always produce the same output). This restricts what can be done in the function, but allows it to be used in-line in the query if it is defined to be ""pure"". Otherwise, a function (not necessarily deterministic) can return a variable or a result set. In the case of a function returning a result set, you can join it against some other selection in a query. However, you cannot use a non-deterministic function like this in a correlated subquery as the optimiser cannot predict what sort of result set will be returned (this is computationally intractable, like the halting problem).","A function can be in-lined into a SQL statement and must be pure, whereas a procedure cannot.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"The problems with singletons is the issue of increased scope and therefore coupling. There is no denying that there are some of situations where you do need access to a single instance, and it can be accomplished other ways. I now prefer to design around an inversion of control (IoC) container and allow the the lifetimes to be controlled by the container. This gives you the benefit of the classes that depend on the instance to be unaware of the fact that there is a single instance. The lifetime of the singleton can be changed in the future. Once such example I encountered recently was an easy adjustment from single threaded to multi-threaded. FWIW, if it a PIA when you try to unit test it then it's going to PIA when you try to debug, bug fix or enhance it.","The problems with singletons include increased scope and coupling, making them difficult to test, debug, and maintain.",,The problems with singletons is the issue of increased scope and therefore coupling.
137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"Firstly a class and its collaborators should firstly perform their intended purpose rather than focusing on deoendents. Lifecycle management (when instances are creared snd when they go out of scope) should not be part of the cladses responsibility. The accepted best practice for this is to craft or configure a new component to manage dependencies using dependency injection. Often software gets more complicated it makes sense to have multiple independent instances of the ""singleton"" class with different state. Committing code to simply grab the singleton is wrong in such cases. Using Singleton.getInstance() might be ok for small simple systems but it doesn't work / scale when one might need a different instance of the same class. No class should be thought of as a singleton but rather that should be an aplication of it's usage or how it is used to configure dependents. For a quick and nasty this does not matter- just luke hardcoding say file paths does not matter but for bigger applications such dependencies need to be factored out and managed in more appropriate way using DI. The problems that singleton cause in testing is a symptom of their hard coded single usage case/environment. The test suite and the many tests are each individual and separate something that is not compatible with hardcoding a singleton.","Singletons are problematic because they mix lifecycle management with a class's primary purpose, making it hard to manage dependencies and test the class.

35837,What is the Difference Between Mercurial and Git?,"I work on Mercurial, but fundamentally I believe both systems are equivalent. They both work with the same abstractions: a series of snapshots (changesets) which make up the history. Each changeset knows where it came from (the parent changeset) and can have many child changesets. The recent hg-git extension provides a two-way bridge between Mercurial and Git and sort of shows this point. Git has a strong focus on mutating this history graph (with all the consequences that entails) whereas Mercurial does not encourage history rewriting, but it's easy to do anyway and the consequences of doing so are exactly what you should expect them to be (that is, if I modify a changeset you already have, your client will see it as new if you pull from me). So Mercurial has a <em>bias</em> towards non-destructive commands. As for light-weight branches, then Mercurial has supported repositories with <em>multiple branches</em> since..., always I think. Git repositories with multiple branches are exactly that: multiple diverged strands of development in a single repository. Git then adds names to these strands and allow you to query these names remotely. The Bookmarks extension for Mercurial adds local names, and with Mercurial 1.6, you can move these bookmarks around when you push/pull.. I use Linux, but apparently TortoiseHg is faster and better than the Git equivalent on Windows (due to better usage of the poor Windows filesystem). Both http://github.com and http://bitbucket.org provide online hosting, the service at Bitbucket is great and responsive (I haven't tried github).

894490,SQL left join vs multiple tables on FROM line?,"The old syntax, with just listing the tables, and using the <code>WHERE</code> clause to specify the join criteria, is being deprecated in most modern databases. It's not just for show, the old syntax has the possibility of being ambiguous when you use both INNER and OUTER joins in the same query. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose you have 3 tables in your system: BIGBLOCK Each table contain numerous rows, linked together. You got multiple companies, and each company can have multiple departments, and each department can have multiple employees. Ok, so now you want to do the following: List all the companies, and include all their departments, and all their employees. Note that some companies don't have any departments yet, but make sure you include them as well. Make sure you only retrieve departments that have employees, but always list all companies. So you do this: BIGBLOCK Note that the last one there is an inner join, in order to fulfill the criteria that you only want departments with people. Ok, so what happens now. Well, the problem is, it depends on the database engine, the query optimizer, indexes, and table statistics. Let me explain. If the query optimizer determines that the way to do this is to first take a company, then find the departments, and then do an inner join with employees, you're not going to get any companies that don't have departments. The reason for this is that the <code>WHERE</code> clause determines which <em>rows</em> end up in the final result, not individual parts of the rows. And in this case, due to the left join, the Department.ID column will be NULL, and thus when it comes to the INNER JOIN to Employee, there's no way to fulfill that constraint for the Employee row, and so it won't appear. On the other hand, if the query optimizer decides to tackle the department-employee join first, and then do a left join with the companies, you will see them. So the old syntax is ambiguous. There's no way to specify what you want, without dealing with query hints, and some databases have no way at all. Enter the new syntax, with this you can choose. For instance, if you want all companies, as the problem description stated, this is what you would write: BIGBLOCK Here you specify that you want the department-employee join to be done as one join, and then left join the results of that with the companies. Additionally, let's say you only want departments that contains the letter X in their name. Again, with old style joins, you risk losing the company as well, if it doesn't have any departments with an X in its name, but with the new syntax, you can do this: BIGBLOCK This extra clause is used for the joining, but is not a filter for the entire row. So the row might appear with company information, but might have NULLs in all the department and employee columns for that row, because there is no department with an X in its name for that company. This is hard with the old syntax. This is why, amongst other vendors, Microsoft has deprecated the old outer join syntax, but not the old inner join syntax, since SQL Server 2005 and upwards. The only way to talk to a database running on Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or 2008, using the old style outer join syntax, is to set that database in 8.0 compatibility mode (aka SQL Server 2000). Additionally, the old way, by throwing a bunch of tables at the query optimizer, with a bunch of WHERE clauses, was akin to saying ""here you are, do the best you can"". With the new syntax, the query optimizer has less work to do in order to figure out what parts goes together. So there you have it. LEFT and INNER JOIN is the wave of the future.","The old SQL syntax for joining tables, using the `WHERE` clause, is being deprecated due to ambiguity issues, particularly with inner and outer joins.

The <code>thumbnailImage</code> field is marked as <code>transient</code>, so only the original <code>image</code> is serialized rather than persisting both the original image and the thumbnail image. This means that less storage would be needed to save the serialized object. (Of course, this may or may not be desirable depending on the requirements of the system -- this is just an example.) At the time of deserialization, the <code>readObject</code> method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object back to the state at which the serialization occurred. Here, the thumbnail needs to be generated, so the <code>readObject</code> method is overridden so that the thumbnail will be generated by calling the <code>generateThumbnail</code> method. For additional information, the Discover the secrets of the Java Serialization API article (which was originally available on the Sun Developer Network) has a section which discusses the use of and presents a scenario where the <code>transient</code> keyword is used to prevent serialization of certain fields.","The `transient` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized, allowing it to be generated programmatically instead of being persisted via serialization.",,"The <code>transient</code> keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized. Variables may be marked <code>transient</code> to  indicate that they are not part of the  persistent state of an object.

Additionally App Server have components and features to support Application level services such as Connection Pooling, Object Pooling, Transaction Support, Messaging services etc. <li>As web servers are well suited for static content and app servers for dynamic content, most of the production environments have web server acting as reverse proxy to app server. That means while servicing a page request, static contents (such as images/Static HTML) are served by web server that interprets the request. Using some kind of filtering technique (mostly extension of requested resource) web server identifies dynamic content request and transparently forwards to app server Example of such configuration is Apache Tomcat HTTP Server and Oracle (formerly BEA) WebLogic Server. Apache Tomcat HTTP Server is Web Server and Oracle WebLogic is Application Server. In some cases the servers are tightly integrated such as IIS and .NET Runtime. IIS is web server.

I think that the main point is that the web server exposes everything through the http protocol, while the application server is not restricted to it.

936197,What is the difference between application server and web server?,"As Rutesh and jmservera pointed out, the distinction is a fuzzy one. Historically, they were different, but through the 90's these two previously distinct categories blended features and effectively merged. At this point is is probably best to imagine that the ""App Server"" product category is a strict superset of the ""web server"" category. Some history. In early days of the Mosaic browser and hyperlinked content, there evolved this thing called a ""web server"" that served web page content and images over HTTP. Most of the content was static, and the HTTP 1.0 protocol was just a way to ship files around. Quickly the ""web server"" category evolved to include CGI capability - effectively launching a process on each web request to generate dynamic content. HTTP also matured and the products became more sophisticated, with caching, security, and management features. As the technology matured, we got company-specific Java-based server-side technology from Kiva and NetDynamics, which eventually all merged into JSP. Microsoft added ASP, I think in 1996, to Windows NT 4.0. The static web server had learned some new tricks, so that it was an effective ""app server"" for many scenarios. In a parallel category, the app server had evolved and existed for a long time. companies delivered products for Unix like Tuxedo, TopEnd, Encina that were philosophically derived from Mainframe application management and monitoring environments like IMS and CICS. Microsoft's offering was Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), which later evolved into COM+. Most of these products specified ""closed"" product-specific communications protocols to interconnect ""fat"" clients to servers. (For Encina, the comms protocol was DCE RPC; for MTS it was DCOM; etc.) In 1995/96, these traditional app server products began to embed basic HTTP communication capability, at first via gateways. And the lines began to blur. Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads, more concurrency, and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability. At this point the line between ""app server"" and ""web server"" is a fuzzy one. But people continue to use the terms differently, as a matter of emphasis. When someone says ""web server"" you often think HTTP-centric, web UI, oriented apps. When someone says ""App server"" you may think ""heavier loads, enterprise features, transactions and queuing, multi-channel communication (HTTP + more). But often it is the same product that serves both sets of workload requirements. <li>WebSphere, IBM's ""app server"" has its own bundled web server. <li>WebLogic, another traditional app server, likewise. <li>Windows, which is Microsoft's App Server (in addition to being its File&amp;Print Server, Media Server, etc. ), bundles IIS.","The distinction between application server and web server is fuzzy, with the terms often used differently depending on emphasis.

You say you have the unlimited jurisdiction patch installed, so the AES-256 cipher should be supported (but then 256-bit keys should be too, so this might be a configuration problem). A workaround for lack of AES-256 support is to take some freely available implementation of AES-256, and use it as a custom provider. This involves creating your own <code>Provider</code> subclass and using it with <code>Cipher.getInstance(String, Provider)</code>.

Then to derive a good key from this information: The magic numbers (which could be defined as constants somewhere) 65536 and 256 are the key derivation iteration count and the key size, respectively. The key derivation function is iterated to require significant computational effort, and that prevents attackers from quickly trying many different passwords. The iteration count can be changed depending on the computing resources available. The key size can be reduced to 128 bits, which is still considered ""strong"" encryption, but it doesn't give much of a safety margin if attacks are discovered that weaken AES. Used with a proper block-chaining mode, the same derived key can be used to encrypt many messages. In CBC, a random initialization vector (IV) is generated for each message, yielding different cipher text even if the plain text is identical. CBC may not be the most secure mode available to you (see AEAD below); there are many other modes with different security properties, but they all use a similar random input. In any case, the outputs of each encryption operation are the cipher text and the initialization vector: Store the <code>ciphertext</code> and the <code>iv</code>. On decryption, the <code>SecretKey</code> is regenerated in exactly the same way, using using the password with the same salt and iteration parameters.

1028250,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external ""stimuli"" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations. This is pretty well suited to UI design, for example, in which touching a user interface control (say, the volume control on a music playing application) might need to update various display items and the actual volume of audio output. When you modify the volume (a slider, let's say) that would correspond to modifying the value associated with a node in a directed graph. Various nodes having edges from that ""volume value"" node would automatically be triggered and any necessary computations and updates would naturally ripple through the application. The application ""reacts"" to the user stimulus. Functional reactive programming would just be the implementation of this idea in a functional language, or generally within a functional programming paradigm. For more on ""dataflow computing"", search for those two words on Wikipedia or using your favorite search engine. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs ""triggered"" or ""marked"". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. The graph might be implicit or explicit depending on exactly how reactive programming is implemented. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Dataflow computing is fairly well suited to situations in which triggering computations asynchronously giving rise to cascades of computations works better than trying to have execution be governed by a clock (or clocks). Reactive programming imports this ""cascade of execution"" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the ""outside world"" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. Program execution would then look like something analogous to a complex reflex arc. The program may or may not be basically sessile between stimuli or may settle into a basically sessile state between stimuli. ""non-reactive"" programming would be programming with a very different view of the flow of execution and relationship to external inputs. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs ""reacts"" to them. But looking at the spirit of the thing, a program that polls an event queue at a fixed interval and dispatches any events found to functions (or threads) is less reactive (because it only attends to user input at a fixed interval). Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.","Reactive programming is a programming paradigm where a program is viewed as a directed graph of nodes performing computations, connected by links that provide inputs to other nodes.

1028250,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"In pure functional programming, there are no side-effects. For many types of software (for example, anything with user interaction) side-effects are necessary at some level. One way to get side-effect like behavior while still retaining a functional style is to use functional reactive programming. This is the combination of functional programming, and reactive programming. (The Wikipedia article you linked to is about the latter.) The basic idea behind reactive programming is that there are certain datatypes that represent a value ""over time"". Computations that involve these changing-over-time values will themselves have values that change over time. For example, you could represent the mouse coordinates as a pair of integer-over-time values. Let's say we had something like (this is pseudo-code): BIGBLOCK At any moment in time, x and y would have the coordinates of the mouse. Unlike non-reactive programming, we only need to make this assignment once, and the x and y variables will stay ""up to date"" automatically. This is why reactive programming and functional programming work so well together: reactive programming removes the need to mutate variables while still letting you do a lot of what you could accomplish with variable mutations. If we then do some computations based on this the resulting values will also be values that change over time.

1028250,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"If you want to get a feel for FRP, you could start with the old Fran tutorial from 1998, which has animated illustrations. For papers, start with <em>Functional Reactive Animation</em> and then follow up on links on the publications link on my home page and the FRP link on the Haskell wiki. Personally, I like to think about what FRP <em>means</em> before addressing how it might be implemented. (Code without a specification is an answer without a question and thus ""not even wrong"". )So I don't describe FRP in representation/implementation terms as Thomas K does in another answer (graphs, nodes, edges, firing, execution, etc).There are many possible implementation styles, but no implementation says what FRP <em>is</em>. I do resonate with Laurence G's simple description that FRP is about ""datatypes that represent a value 'over time' "".Conventional imperative programming captures these dynamic values only indirectly, through state and mutations.The complete history (past, present, future) has no first class representation.Moreover, only <em>discretely evolving</em> values can be (indirectly) captured, since the imperative paradigm is temporally discrete.In contrast, FRP captures these evolving values <em>directly</em> and has no difficulty with <em>continuously</em> evolving values. FRP is also unusual in that it is concurrent without running afoul of the theoretical &amp; pragmatic rats' nest that plagues imperative concurrency.Semantically, FRP's concurrency is <em>fine-grained</em>, <em>determinate</em>, and <em>continuous</em>. (I'm talking about meaning, not implementation. An implementation may or may not involve concurrency or parallelism. )Semantic determinacy is very important for reasoning, both rigorous and informal.While concurrency adds enormous complexity to imperative programming (due to nondeterministic interleaving), it is effortless in FRP. So, what is FRP?You could have invented it yourself.Start with these ideas: <li>Dynamic/evolving values (i.e., values ""over time"") are first class values in themselves. You can define them and combine them, pass them into &amp; out of functions. I called these things ""behaviors"". <li>Behaviors are built up out of a few primitives, like constant (static) behaviors and time (like a clock), and then with sequential and parallel combination. <em>n</em> behaviors are combined by applying an n-ary function (on static values), ""point-wise"", i.e., continuously over time. <li>To account for discrete phenomena, have another type (family) of ""events"", each of which has a stream (finite or infinite) of occurrences. Each occurrence has an associated time and value. <li>To come up with the compositional vocabulary out of which all behaviors and events can be built, play with some examples. Keep deconstructing into pieces that are more general/simple. <li>So that you know you're on solid ground, give the whole model a compositional foundation, using the technique of denotational semantics, which just means that (a) each type has a corresponding simple &amp; precise mathematical type of ""meanings"", and (b) each primitive and operator has a simple &amp; precise meaning as a function of the meanings of the constituents.<em>Never, ever</em> mix implementation considerations into your exploration process. If this description is gibberish to you, consult (a) <em>Denotational design with type class morphisms</em>, (b) <em>Push-pull functional reactive programming</em> (ignoring the implementation bits), and (c) the <em>Denotational Semantics</em> Haskell wikibooks page. Beware that denotational semantics has two parts, from its two founders Christopher Strachey and Dana Scott: the easier &amp; more useful Strachey part and the harder and less useful (for software design) Scott part. If you stick with these principles, I expect you'll get something more-or-less in the spirit of FRP. Where did I get these principles? In software design, I always ask the same question: ""what does it mean? "".Denotational semantics gave me a precise framework for this question, and one that fits my aesthetics (unlike operational or axiomatic semantics, both of which leave me unsatisfied).So I asked myself what is behavior?I soon realized that the temporally discrete nature of imperative computation is an accommodation to a particular style of <em>machine</em>, rather than a natural description of behavior itself.The simplest precise description of behavior I can think of is simply ""function of (continuous) time"", so that's my model.Delightfully, this model handles continuous, deterministic concurrency with ease and grace. It's been quite a challenge to implement this model correctly and efficiently, but that's another story.","FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) is about representing dynamic values as first-class values that evolve over time. It captures these values directly, allowing for continuous and concurrent computation without the complexity of imperative concurrency.

1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","If you think about the Greek roots of the term, it should become obvious. Poly = many: polygon = many-sided, polystyrene = many styrenes (a), polyglot = many languages, and so on. Morph = change or form: morphology = study of biological form, Morpheus = the Greek god of dreams able to take any form. So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). For example, in many languages, integers and floats are implicitly polymorphic since you can add, subtract, multiply and so on, irrespective of the fact that the types are different. They're rarely considered as objects in the usual term. But, in that same way, a class like <code>BigDecimal</code> or <code>Rational</code> or <code>Imaginary</code> can also provide those operations, even though they operate on different data types. The classic example is the <code>Shape</code> class and all the classes that can inherit from it (square, circle, dodecahedron, irregular polygon, splat and so on). With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. A point shape needs only two co-ordinates (assuming it's in a two-dimensional space of course). A circle needs a center and radius. A square or rectangle needs two co-ordinates for the top left and bottom right corners and (possibly) a rotation. An irregular polygon needs a series of lines. By making the class responsible for its code as well as its data, you can achieve polymorphism. In this example, every class would have its own <code>Draw()</code> function and the client code could simply do: to get the correct behavior for any shape. This is in contrast to the old way of doing things in which the code was separate from the data, and you would have had functions such as <code>drawSquare()</code> and <code>drawCircle()</code>. Object orientation, polymorphism and inheritance are all closely-related concepts and they're vital to know. There have been many ""silver bullets"" during my long career which basically just fizzled out but the OO paradigm has turned out to be a good one. Learn it, understand it, love it - you'll be glad you did :-) (a) I originally wrote that as a joke but it turned out to be correct and, therefore, not that funny. The momomer styrene happens to be made from carbon and hydrogen, <code>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub></code>, and polystyrene is made from groups of that, <code>(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)<sub>n</sub></code>. Perhaps I should have stated that a polyp was many occurrences of the letter <code>p</code> although, now that I've had to explain the joke, even that doesn't seem funny either. Sometimes, you should just quit while you're behind :-)","Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types) in programming, allowing the same code to work with various data types, such as integers, floats, or custom classes like shapes (e.g., square, circle, polygon), by making the class responsible for its code and data.",,"So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).

For instance: A student object is also a person object. If you ""look"" (ie cast) at the student, you can probably ask for the student ID. You can't always do that with a person, right? (a person is not necessarily a student, thus might not have a student ID). However, a person probably has a name. A student does too. Bottom line, ""looking"" at the same object from different ""angles"" can give you different ""perspectives"" (ie different properties or methods) So this technique lets you build stuff that can be ""looked"" at from different angles. Why do we use polymorphism? For starters ... abstraction. At this point it should be enough info :)","Polymorphism is a technique that allows objects to be viewed as different types, enabling different properties or methods to be accessed based on the ""angle"" or perspective.

1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","Generally speaking, it's the ability to interface a number of different types of object using the same or a superficially similar API. There are various forms: Function overloading: defining multiple functions with the same name and different parameter types, such as sqrt(float), sqrt(double) and sqrt(complex). In most languages that allow this, the compiler will automatically select the correct one for the type of argument being passed into it, thus this is compile-time polymorphism. Virtual methods in OOP: a method of a class can have various implementations tailored to the specifics of its subclasses; each of these is said to override the implementation given in the base class. Given an object that may be of the base class or any of its subclasses, the correct implementation is selected on the fly, thus this is run-time polymorphism. Templates: a feature of some OO languages whereby a function, class, etc. can be parameterised by a type. For example, you can define a generic ""list"" template class, and then instantiate it as ""list of integers"", ""list of strings"", maybe even ""list of lists of strings"" or the like. Generally, you write the code once for a data structure of arbitrary element type, and the compiler generates versions of it for the various element types.","Polymorphism is the ability to interface different object types using the same API through compile-time or run-time selection, allowing for generic code and flexible object behavior.",,"Generally speaking, it's the ability to interface a number of different types of object using the same or a superficially similar API."
1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","Polymorphism is the ability of the programmer to write methods of the same name that do different things for different types of objects, depending on the needs of those objects. For example, if you were developing a class called <code>Fraction</code> and a class called <code>ComplexNumber</code>, both of these might include a method called <code>display()</code>, but each of them would implement that method differently. In PHP, for example, you might implement it like this: Outputs: Some of the other answers seem to imply that polymorphism is used only in conjunction with inheritance; for example, maybe <code>Fraction</code> and <code>ComplexNumber</code> both implement an abstract class called <code>Number</code> that has a method <code>display()</code>, which Fraction and ComplexNumber are then both obligated to implement. But you don't need inheritance to take advantage of polymorphism. At least in dynamically-typed languages like PHP (I don't know about C++ or Java), polymorphism allows the developer to call a method without necessarily knowing the type of object ahead of time, and trusting that the correct implementation of the method will be called. For example, say the user chooses the type of <code>Number</code> created: In this case, the appropriate <code>display()</code> method will be called, even though the developer can't know ahead of time whether the user will choose a fraction or a complex number.","Polymorphism is the ability of methods of the same name to do different things for different types of objects, allowing a method to be called without knowing the object's type ahead of time.","At least in dynamically-typed languages like PHP (I don't know about C++ or Java), polymorphism allows the developer to call a method without necessarily knowing the type of object ahead of time, and trusting that the correct implementation of the method will be called.","Polymorphism is the ability of the programmer to write methods of the same name that do different things for different types of objects, depending on the needs of those objects."

That necessarily misses out rather a lot. The metaphor breaks down pretty fast when you actually use a FRP system.

43021,How do you get the index of the current iteration of a foreach loop?,"I disagree with comments that a <code>for</code> loop is a better choice in most cases. <code>foreach</code> is a useful construct, and not replaceble by a <code>for</code> loop in all circumstances. For example, if you have a <strong>DataReader</strong> and loop through all records using a <code>foreach</code> it automatically calls the <strong>Dispose</strong> method and closes the reader (which can then close the connection automatically). This is therefore safer as it prevents connection leaks even if you forget to close the reader. (Sure it is good practise to always close readers but the compiler is not going to catch it if you don't - you can't guarantee you have closed all readers but you can make it more likely you won't leak connections by getting in the habit of using foreach.) There may be other examples of the implicit call of the <code>Dispose</code> method being useful.","Using a `foreach` loop can be safer than a `for` loop when working with disposable objects, such as a `DataReader`, as it automatically calls the `Dispose` method and prevents connection leaks.",,"<code>foreach</code> is a useful construct, and not replaceble by a <code>for</code> loop in all circumstances.

It has experimental support in a number of browsers. Original answer: From the HTML5 spec (at the time of writing: June '09): User agents should not provide a  public API to cause videos to be shown  full-screen. A script, combined with a  carefully crafted video file, could  trick the user into thinking a  system-modal dialog had been shown,  and prompt the user for a password. There is also the danger of ""mere""  annoyance, with pages launching  full-screen videos when links are  clicked or pages navigated. Instead,  user-agent specific interface features  may be provided to easily allow the  user to obtain a full-screen playback  mode.

1074081,Hibernate Error: org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException: a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session,"I have had this error many times and it can be quite hard to track down... Basically, what hibernate is saying is that you have two objects which have the same identifier (same primary key) but they are not the same object. I would suggest you break down your code, i.e. comment out bits until the error goes away and then put the code back until it comes back and you should find the error it. It most often happens via cascading saves where there is a cascade save between object A and B, but object B has already been associated with the session but not on the same instance of B. What primary key generator are you using? The reason I ask is this error is related to how you're telling hibernate to ascertain the persistent state of an object (i.e. whether an object is persistent or not). The error could be happening because hibernate is trying to persist and object that is already persistent. In fact, if you use save hibernate will try and persist that object, and maybe there is already an object with that same primary key associated with the session. Example Assuming you have a hibernate class object for a table with 10 rows based on a primary key combination (column 1 and column 2). Now, you have removed 5 rows from the table at some point of time. Now, if you try to add the same 10 rows again, while hibernate tries to persist the objects in database, 5 rows which were already removed will be added without errors. Now the remaining 5 rows which are already existing, will throw this exception. So the easy approach would be checking if you have updated/removed any value in a table which is part of something and later are you trying to insert the same objects again","The error occurs when Hibernate tries to persist an object that's already associated with the session, often due to cascading saves or a primary key generator issue.

Otherwise, it's not a singleton. This is a very odd requirement, hardly ever of interest to the user. Processes and address space isolation are an implementation detail. They only impact on the user when they want to stop your application using <code>kill</code> or Task Manager. Apart from building a caching system, there aren't that many reasons why you'd be so certain that there should only be on instance of something per process. How about a logging system? Might be better for that to be per-thread or more fine-grained so you can trace the origin of messages more automatically. How about the application's main window? It depends; maybe you'll want all the user's documents to be managed by the same process for some reason, in which case there would be multiple ""main windows"" in that process.","Singletons are rarely a good solution, as they often hide complexity and are not a natural fit for most use cases, except in rare cases like process-wide caching or logging systems.",,"If you need one instance of this object per process address space (and you are as confident as you can be that this requirement will not change), you should make it a singleton."

1177449,Best approach to remove time part of datetime in SQL Server,"I, personally, almost always use User Defined functions for this if dealing with SQL Server 2005 (or lower version), however, it should be noted that there are specific drawbacks to using UDF's, especially if applying them to WHERE clauses (see below and the comments on this answer for further details). If using SQL Server 2008 (or higher) - see below. In fact, for most databases that I create, I add these UDF's in right near the start since I know there's a 99% chance I'm going to need them sooner or later. I create one for ""date only"" &amp; ""time only"" (although the ""date only"" one is by far the most used of the two). Here's some links to a variety of date-related UDF's: Essential SQL Server Date, Time and DateTime Functions Get Date Only Function That last link shows no less than 3 different ways to getting the date only part of a datetime field and mentions some pros and cons of each approach. If using a UDF, it should be noted that you should try to avoid using the UDF as part of a WHERE clause in a query as this will greatly hinder performance of the query. The main reason for this is that using a UDF in a WHERE clause renders that clause as non-sargable, which means that SQL Server can no longer use an index with that clause in order to improve the speed of query execution. With reference to my own usage of UDF's, I'll frequently use the ""raw"" date column within the WHERE clause, but apply the UDF to the SELECTed column. In this way, the UDF is only applied to the filtered result-set and not every row of the table as part of the filter. Of course, the absolute <em>best</em> approach for this is to use SQL Server 2008 (or higher) and separate out your dates and times, as the SQL Server database engine is then natively providing the individual date and time components, and can efficiently query these independently without the need for a UDF or other mechanism to extract either the date or time part from a composite datetime type.","Use a User Defined Function (UDF) to remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server 2005 and lower, or use the native date and time components in SQL Server 2008 and higher.",,"I, personally, almost always use User Defined functions for this if dealing with SQL Server 2005 (or lower version), however, it should be noted that there are specific drawbacks to using UDF's, especially if applying them to WHERE clauses (see below and the comments on this answer for further details).

1191282,How to see the changes between two commits without commits in-between?,"Asking for the difference /between/ two commits without including the commits in-between makes little sense. Commits are just snapshots of the contents of the repository; asking for the difference between two necessarily includes them. So the question then is, what are you really looking for? As William suggested, cherry-picking can give you the delta of a single commit rebased on top of another. That is: This takes commit 'abcdef', compares it to its immediate ancestor, then applies that difference on top of '012345'. This new difference is then shown - the only change is the context comes from '012345' rather than 'abcdef's immediate ancestor. Of course, you may get conflicts and etc, so it's not a very useful process in most cases. If you're just interested in abcdef itself, you can do: This compares abcdef to its immediate ancestor, alone, and is usually what you want. And of course gives you all differences between those two commits. It would help to get a better idea of what you're trying to achieve - as I mentioned, asking for the difference between two commits without what's in between doesn't actually make sense.","Asking for the difference between two commits without including commits in-between doesn't make sense, as commits are snapshots.

1251636,What do Clustered and Non clustered index actually mean?,"A clustered index means you are telling the database to store close values actually close to one another on the disk. This has the benefit of rapid scan / retrieval of records falling into some range of clustered index values. For example, you have two tables, Customer and Order: If you wish to quickly retrieve all orders of one particular customer, you may wish to create a clustered index on the ""CustomerID"" column of the Order table. This way the records with the same CustomerID will be physically stored close to each other on disk (clustered) which speeds up their retrieval. P.S. The index on CustomerID will obviously be not unique, so you either need to add a second field to ""uniquify"" the index or let the database handle that for you but that's another story. Regarding multiple indexes. You can have only one clustered index per table because this defines how the data is physically arranged. If you wish an analogy, imagine a big room with many tables in it. You can either put these tables to form several rows or pull them all together to form a big conference table, but not both ways at the same time. A table can have other indexes, they will then point to the entries in the clustered index which in its turn will finally say where to find the actual data.","A clustered index stores data physically close together on disk, speeding up retrieval of records with similar values, but only one per table can exist.",,A clustered index means you are telling the database to store close values actually close to one another on the disk. This has the benefit of rapid scan / retrieval of records falling into some range of clustered index values.
1251636,What do Clustered and Non clustered index actually mean?,"With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index. Therefore, there can be only one clustered index. With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows. You can have many non clustered indexes, although each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records. It is generally faster to read from a clustered index if you want to get back all the columns. You do not have to go first to the index and then to the table. Writing to a table with a clustered index can be slower, if there is a need to rearrange the data.","Clustered index stores rows in the same order as the index, allowing only one per table. Non-clustered index has a separate list of pointers to the physical rows, allowing multiple indexes per table, but increasing write time and making reads from the clustered index faster.",,"With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index.

1251636,What do Clustered and Non clustered index actually mean?,"A very simple, non-technical rule-of-thumb would be that clustered indexes are usually used for your primary key (or, at least, a unique column) and that non-clustered are used for other situations (maybe a foreign key). Indeed, SQL Server will by default create a clustered index on your primary key column(s).

28002,Regular cast vs. static_cast vs. dynamic_cast,"You should look at the article <em>C++ Programming/Type Casting</em>. It contains a good description of all of the different cast types. The following taken from the above link: const_cast const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types. 'e.g.' char->long, int->short etc. Static cast is also used to cast pointers to related types, for  example casting void* to the appropriate type. dynamic_cast Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy). dynamic_cast(expression) The target type must be a pointer or reference type, and the  expression must evaluate to a pointer or reference. Dynamic cast works  only when the type of object to which the expression refers is  compatible with the target type and the base class has at least one  virtual member function. If not, and the type of expression being cast  is a pointer, NULL is returned, if a dynamic cast on a reference  fails, a bad_cast exception is thrown. When it doesn't fail, dynamic  cast returns a pointer or reference of the target type to the object  to which expression referred. reinterpret_cast Reinterpret cast simply casts one type bitwise to another. Any pointer  or integral type can be casted to any other with reinterpret cast,  easily allowing for misuse. For instance, with reinterpret cast one  might, unsafely, cast an integer pointer to a string pointer.","There are four types of casts in C++: 

1. `const_cast` removes const or volatile properties.
2. `static_cast` casts between integer types or pointers to related types.
3. `dynamic_cast` casts at run-time for inheritance, returning NULL or throwing an exception if it fails.
4. `reinterpret_cast` performs a bitwise cast between any pointer or integral type.",,"const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types.

Same as above, but only the Python code: This will throw an exception if no IP address is configured. Version that will also work on LANs without an internet connection: (thanks @ccpizza) Background: Using <code>socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())</code> did not work here, because one of the computers I was on had an <code>/etc/hosts</code> with duplicate entries and references to itself. <code>socket.gethostbyname()</code> only returns the last entry in <code>/etc/hosts</code>. This was my initial attempt, which weeds out all addresses starting with <code>""127. ""</code>: This works with Python 2 and 3, on Linux and Windows, but does not deal with several network devices or IPv6. However, it stopped working on recent Linux distros, so I tried this alternative technique instead. It tries to connect to the Google DNS server at <code>8.8.8.8</code> at port <code>53</code>: Then I combined the two above techniques into a one-liner that should work everywhere, and created the <code>myip</code> alias and Python snippet at the top of this answer.

When you create an array using You're telling the interpreter to create a new runtime array. No extra processing necessary at all. Done.

It then looks up through your execution context to find the constructor to call, and calls it, creating your array. You may think ""Well, this doesn't matter at all. They're the same!"". Unfortunately you can't guarantee that. Take the following example: In the above example, the first call will alert 'SPARTA' as you'd expect. The second will not. You will end up seeing undefined. You'll also note that b contains all of the native Array object functions such as <code>push</code>, where the other does not. While you may expect this to happen, it just illustrates the fact that <code>[]</code> is not the same as <code>new Array()</code>. It's probably best to just use <code>[]</code> if you know you just want an array.

1479776,"""Too many values to unpack"" Exception","This problem looked familiar so I thought I'd see if I could replicate from the limited amount of information. A quick search turned up an entry in James Bennett's blog here which mentions that when working with the UserProfile to extend the User model a common mistake in settings.py can cause Django to throw this error. To quote the blog entry: The value of the setting is not ""appname.models.modelname"", it's just ""appname.modelname"". The reason is that Django is not using this to do a direct import; instead, it's using an internal model-loading function which only wants the name of the app and the name of the model. Trying to do things like ""appname.models.modelname"" or ""projectname.appname.models.modelname"" in the AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE setting will cause Django to blow up with the dreaded ""too many values to unpack"" error, so make sure you've put ""appname.modelname"", and nothing else, in the value of AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE. If the OP had copied more of the traceback I would expect to see something like the one below which I was able to duplicate by adding ""models"" to my AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE setting. This I think is one of the few cases where Django still has a bit of import magic that tends to cause confusion when a small error doesn't throw the expected exception. You can see at the end of the traceback that I posted how using anything other than the form ""appname.modelname"" for the AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE would cause the line ""app_label, model_name = settings.AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE.split('.')"" to throw the ""too many values to unpack"" error. I'm 99% sure that this was the original problem encountered here.","A ""too many values to unpack"" error in Django is often caused by a typo in the AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE setting, where the value should be ""appname.modelname"" (without the ""models"" in the app name).",,A quick search turned up an entry in James Bennett's blog here which mentions that when working with the UserProfile to extend the User model a common mistake in settings.py can cause Django to throw this error.

109023,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"This is one of those questions where it helps to know your micro-architecture. I just timed two variants under gcc 4.3.3 compiled with -O3 using C++ inlines to eliminate function call overhead, one billion iterations, keeping the running sum of all counts to ensure the compiler doesn't remove anything important, using rdtsc for timing (clock cycle precise). The unmodified Hacker's Delight took 12.2 gigacycles. My parallel version (counting twice as many bits) runs in 13.0 gigacycles. 10.5s total elapsed for both together on a 2.4GHz Core Duo. 25 gigacycles = just over 10 seconds at this clock frequency, so I'm confident my timings are right. This has to do with instruction dependency chains, which are very bad for this algorithm. I could nearly double the speed again by using a pair of 64-bit registers. In fact, if I was clever and added x+y a little sooner I could shave off some shifts. The 64-bit version with some small tweaks would come out about even, but count twice as many bits again. With 128 bit SIMD registers, yet another factor of two, and the SSE instruction sets often have clever short-cuts, too. There's no reason for the code to be especially transparent. The interface is simple, the algorithm can be referenced on-line in many places, and it's amenable to comprehensive unit test. The programmer who stumbles upon it might even learn something. These bit operations are extremely natural at the machine level. OK, I decided to bench the tweaked 64-bit version. For this one  sizeof(unsigned long) == 8 That looks about right (I'm not testing carefully, though). Now the timings come out at 10.70 gigacycles / 14.1 gigacycles. That later number summed 128 billion bits and corresponds to 5.9s elapsed on this machine. The non-parallel version speeds up a tiny bit because I'm running in 64-bit mode and it likes 64-bit registers slightly better than 32-bit registers. Let's see if there's a bit more OOO pipelining to be had here. This was a bit more involved, so I actually tested a bit. Each term alone sums to 64, all combined sum to 256. I was excited for a moment, but it turns out gcc is playing inline tricks with -O3 even though I'm not using the inline keyword in some tests. When I let gcc play tricks, a billion calls to pop4() takes 12.56 gigacycles, but I determined it was folding arguments as constant expressions. A more realistic number appears to be 19.6gc for another 30% speed-up. My test loop now looks like this, making sure each argument is different enough to stop gcc from playing tricks. 256 billion bits summed in 8.17s elapsed. Works out to 1.02s for 32 million bits as benchmarked in the 16-bit table lookup. Can't compare directly, because the other bench doesn't give a clock speed, but looks like I've slapped the snot out of the 64KB table edition, which is a tragic use of L1 cache in the first place. Update: decided to do the obvious and create pop6() by adding four more duplicated lines. Came out to 22.8gc, 384 billion bits summed in 9.5s elapsed. So there's another 20%   Now at 800ms for 32 billion bits.","The author compared different methods to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer and found that a parallel version using 64-bit registers is the fastest, but even a simple version using 32-bit registers is efficient.",,

The normal, Pythonic, preferred solution is almost invariably ""duck typing"": try using the argument <em>as if</em> it was of a certain desired type, do it in a <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> statement catching all exceptions that could arise if the argument was not in fact of that type (or any other type nicely duck-mimicking it;-), and in the <code>except</code> clause, try something else (using the argument ""as if"" it was of some other type). <code>basestring</code> <strong>is</strong>, however, quite a special caseÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂ builtin type that exists <strong>only</strong> to let you use <code>isinstance</code> (both <code>str</code> and <code>unicode</code> subclass <code>basestring</code>). Strings are sequences (you could loop over them, index them, slice them, ...), but you generally want to treat them as ""scalar"" typesÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂt's somewhat incovenient (but a reasonably frequent use case) to treat all kinds of strings (and maybe other scalar types, i.e., ones you can't loop on) one way, all containers (lists, sets, dicts, ...) in another way, and <code>basestring</code> plus <code>isinstance</code> helps you do thatÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂhe overall structure of this idiom is something like: You could say that <code>basestring</code> is an <em>Abstract Base Class</em> (""ABC"")Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂt offers no concrete functionality to subclasses, but rather exists as a ""marker"", mainly for use with <code>isinstance</code>. The concept is obviously a growing one in Python, since PEP 3119, which introduces a generalization of it, was accepted and has been implemented starting with Python 2.6 and 3.0. The PEP makes it clear that, while ABCs can often substitute for duck typing, there is generally no big pressure to do that (see here). ABCs as implemented in recent Python versions do however offer extra goodies: <code>isinstance</code> (and <code>issubclass</code>) can now mean more than just ""[an instance of] a derived class"" (in particular, any class can be ""registered"" with an ABC so that it will show as a subclass, and its instances as instances of the ABC); and ABCs can also offer extra convenience to actual subclasses in a very natural way via Template Method design pattern applications (see here and here [[part II]] for more on the TM DP, in general and specifically in Python, independent of ABCs). For the underlying mechanics of ABC support as offered in Python 2.6, see here; for their 3.1 version, very similar, see here. In both versions, standard library module collections (that's the 3.1 versionÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂor the very similar 2.6 version, see here) offers several useful ABCs. For the purpose of this answer, the key thing to retain about ABCs (beyond an arguably more natural placement for TM DP functionality, compared to the classic Python alternative of mixin classes such as UserDict.DictMixin) is that they make <code>isinstance</code> (and <code>issubclass</code>) much more attractive and pervasive (in Python 2.6 and going forward) than they used to be (in 2.5 and before), and therefore, by contrast, make checking type equality an even worse practice in recent Python versions than it already used to be.","`isinstance` checks for inheritance, making it suitable for Python's duck typing, whereas `type()` checks for identity of types, rejecting instances of subtypes. The preferred solution is to use ""duck typing"" by trying to use the argument as if it was of a certain type, catching exceptions and trying something else if it fails.",,"To summarize the contents of other (already good!) answers, <code>isinstance</code> caters for inheritance (an instance of a derived class <em>is an</em> instance of a base class, too), while checking for equality of <code>type</code> does not (it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes, AKA subclasses). For the purpose of this answer, the key thing to retain about ABCs (beyond an arguably more natural placement for TM DP functionality, compared to the classic Python alternative of mixin classes such as UserDict.DictMixin) is that they make <code>isinstance</code> (and <code>issubclass</code>) much more attractive and pervasive (in Python 2.6 and going forward) than they used to be (in 2.5 and before), and therefore, by contrast, make checking type equality an even worse practice in recent Python versions than it already used to be."

Other capabilities like load-balancing, clustering, session-failover, connection pooling etc. that used to be in the realm of application servers, are becoming available on web servers as well directly or through some third party products. Finally, it is worth noting that the picture is further distorted with ""lightweight containers"" like Spring Framework, that often supplement the purpose of application servers in more simple manner and without the application server infrastructure. And since distribution aspect in applications is moving from distributed component towards service paradigm and SOA architecture, there is less and less space left for traditional application servers.","Web servers handle HTTP requests and provide simple programming environments, while application servers support distributed components and offer features like remote invocation and transactions, with the line between the two blurring due to advancements in technology.",,"Web Server -> Programming Environment IIS :                             ASP (.NET) Tomcat :                          Servlet Jetty :                            Servlet Apache :                          Php, CGI Application Servers -> Programming Environment MTS :                                COM+ WAS :                               EJB JBoss :                              EJB WebLogic Application Server :        EJB The crucial difference is that application servers support some <strong>distributed component</strong> technology, providing features like remote invocation and distributed transactions, like <strong>EJB</strong> in Java world or <strong>COM+</strong> on Microsoft platform."

The object instance, <code>a</code>, is implicitly passed as the first argument. <strong>With classmethods</strong>, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument instead of <code>self</code>. You can also call <code>class_foo</code> using the class. In fact, if you define something to bea classmethod, it is probably because you intend to call it from the class rather than from a class instance. <code>A.foo(1)</code> would have raised a TypeError, but <code>A.class_foo(1)</code> works just fine: One use people have found for class methods is to create inheritable alternative constructors. <strong>With staticmethods</strong>, neither <code>self</code> (the object instance) nor  <code>cls</code> (the class) is implicitly passed as the first argument. They behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an instance or the class: Staticmethods are used to group functions which have some logical connection with a class to the class. <code>foo</code> is just a function, but when you call <code>a.foo</code> you don't just get the function,you get a ""partially applied"" version of the function with the object instance <code>a</code> bound as the first argument to the function. <code>foo</code> expects 2 arguments, while <code>a.foo</code> only expects 1 argument. <code>a</code> is bound to <code>foo</code>. That is what is meant by the term ""bound"" below: With <code>a.class_foo</code>, <code>a</code> is not bound to <code>class_foo</code>, rather the class <code>A</code> is bound to <code>class_foo</code>. Here, with a staticmethod, even though it is a method, <code>a.static_foo</code> just returnsa good 'ole function with no arguments bound. <code>static_foo</code> expects 1 argument, and<code>a.static_foo</code> expects 1 argument too. And of course the same thing happens when you call <code>static_foo</code> with the class <code>A</code> instead.","In Python, `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` are used to define methods that can be called without an instance of a class.

1673967,How to run an EXE file in PowerShell with parameters with spaces and quotes,"When PowerShell sees a command starting with a string it just evaluates the string, that is, it typically echos it to the screen, for example: If you want PowerShell to interpret the string as a command name then use the call operator (&amp;) like so: After that you probably only need to quote parameter/argument pairs that contain spaces and/or quotation chars. When you invoke an EXE file like this with complex command line arguments it is usually very helpful to have a tool that will show you how PowerShell sends the arguments to the EXE file. The PowerShell Community Extensions has such a tool. It is called echoargs. You just replace the EXE file with echoargs - leaving all the arguments in place, and it will show you how the EXE file will receive the arguments, for example: Using echoargs you can experiment until you get it right, for example: It turns out I was trying too hard before to maintain the double quotes around the connection string. Apparently that isn't necessary because even cmd.exe will strip those out. BTW, hats off to the PowerShell team. They were quite helpful in showing me the specific incantation of single &amp; double quotes to get the desired result - if you needed to keep the internal double quotes in place. :-)  They also realize this is an area of pain, but they are driven by the number of folks are affected by a particular issue. If this is an area of pain for you, then please vote up this PowerShell bug submission.

Anyway, I've found installing the pos package via Fink (a prerequisite in this case, maybe there is something similar for those who uses MacPorts?) to be the easiest solution. You get two commands: posd - which gives the current directory of the frontmost Finder window (for which you presumably make an alias cdf=cd posd) fdc - which switches the current directory of the frontmost Finder window to the Terminal pwd. This is slightly different from 'open .' which always opens a new finder window. Yes, you have to switch to the Terminal window before writing cdf, but I suppose that's quite cheap comparing to clicking a button in the Finder toolbar. And it works with iTerm as well, you don't have to download a separate Finder toolbar button that opens an iTerm window. This is the same approach as proposed by PCheese, but you don't have to clutter your .bash_profile.","To open the terminal in the current Finder directory on Mac OS, use the `posd` command to get the current directory and `fdc` to switch the Terminal to that directory, or create an alias `cdf=cd posd` and `fdc=fdc`.",,"Anyway, I've found installing the pos package via Fink (a prerequisite in this case, maybe there is something similar for those who uses MacPorts?) to be the easiest solution."

Since every Unix does things a little differently -- Solaris, Mac OS X, IRIX, BSD, and Linux all have their quirks -- POSIX is especially useful to those in the industry as it defines a standard environment to operate in. However, the divergent areas of Unix are typically the focus, rather than the standard ones."

1780599,I never really understood: what is POSIX?,"Let me give the churlish ""unofficial"" explanation. POSIX is a set of standards which attempts to distinguish ""UNIX"" and UNIX-like systems from those which are incompatible with them. It was created by the U.S. government for procurement purposes. The idea was that the U.S. federal procurements needed a way to legally specify the requirements for various sorts of bids and contracts in a way that could be used to exclude systems to which a given existing code base or programming staff would NOT be portable. Since POSIX was written post facto ... to describe a loosely similar set of competing systems ... it was NOT written in a way that could be implemented. So, for example, Microsoft's NT was written with enough POSIX conformance to qualify for some bids ... even though the POSIX subsystem was essentially useless in terms of practical portability and compatibility with UNIX systems. Various other standards for UNIX have been written over the decades. Things like the SPEC1170 (specified eleven hundred and seventy function calls which had to be implemented compatibly) and various incarnations of the SUS (Single UNIX Specification). For the most part these ""standards"" have been inadequate to any practical technical application. They most exist for argumentation, legal wrangling and other dysfunctional reasons.","POSIX is a set of standards for distinguishing UNIX and UNIX-like systems, created by the US government for procurement purposes, but it's loosely defined and not fully implementable, making it mostly useful for legal and argumentative purposes.",,"POSIX is a set of standards which attempts to distinguish ""UNIX"" and UNIX-like systems from those which are incompatible with them.

1835018,How to check if an object is a list or tuple (but not string)?,"Remember that in Python we want to use ""duck typing"". So, anything that acts like a list can be treated as a list. So, don't check for the type of a list, just see if it acts like a list. But strings act like a list too, and often that is not what we want. There are times when it is even a problem! So, check explicitly for a string, but then use duck typing. Here is a function I wrote for fun. It is a special version of <code>repr()</code> that prints any sequence in angle brackets ('&lt;', '>'). This is clean and elegant, overall. But what's that <code>isinstance()</code> check doing there? That's kind of a hack. But it is essential. This function calls itself recursively on anything that acts like a list. If we didn't handle the string specially, then it would be treated like a list, and split up one character at a time. But then the recursive call would try to treat each character as a list -- and it would work! Even a one-character string works as a list! The function would keep on calling itself recursively until stack overflow. Functions like this one, that depend on each recursive call breaking down the work to be done, have to special-case strings--because you can't break down a string below the level of a one-character string, and even a one-character string acts like a list. Note: the <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> is the cleanest way to express our intentions. But if this code were somehow time-critical, we might want to replace it with some sort of test to see if <code>arg</code> is a sequence. Rather than testing the type, we should probably test behaviors. If it has a <code>.strip()</code> method, it's a string, so don't consider it a sequence; otherwise, if it is indexable or iterable, it's a sequence: EDIT: I originally wrote the above with a check for <code>__getslice__()</code> but I noticed that in the <code>collections</code> module documentation, the interesting method is <code>__getitem__()</code>; this makes sense, that's how you index an object. That seems more fundamental than <code>__getslice__()</code> so I changed the above.","A function to check if an object is a list or tuple (excluding strings) using duck typing, recursively checking for indexability and iterability.",,

1835018,How to check if an object is a list or tuple (but not string)?,"Generally speaking, the fact that a function which iterates over an object works on strings as well as tuples and lists is more feature than bug. You certainly can use <code>isinstance</code> or duck typing to check an argument, but why should you? That sounds like a rhetorical question, but it isn't. The answer to ""why should I check the argument's type?"" is probably going to suggest a solution to the real problem, not the perceived problem. Why is it a bug when a string is passed to the function? Also:  if it's a bug when a string is passed to this function, is it also a bug if some other non-list/tuple iterable is passed to it? Why, or why not? I think that the most common answer to the question is likely to be that developers who write <code>f(""abc"")</code> are expecting the function to behave as though they'd written <code>f([""abc""])</code>. There are probably circumstances where it makes more sense to protect developers from themselves than it does to support the use case of iterating across the characters in a string. But I'd think long and hard about it first.",The problem is likely a misunderstanding of how functions should behave when passed a string. The solution is to reconsider the function's behavior rather than checking the argument's type.,,

3881,IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?,"Voted up Jason Cohen's argument because it was well presented. Let me dismember it step by step. ;-) The NPE JavaDoc explicitly says, ""other illegal uses of the null object"". If it was just limited to situations where the runtime encounters a null when it shouldn't, all such cases could be defined far more succinctly. Can't help it if you assume the wrong thing, but assuming encapsulation is applied properly, you really shouldn't care or notice whether a null was dereferenced inappropriately vs. whether a method detected an inappropriate null and fired an exception off. I'd choose NPE over IAE for multiple reasons It is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation Logic that mistakenly allows nulls tends to be very different from logic that mistakenly allows illegal values. For example, if I'm validating data entered by a user, if I get value that is unacceptable, the source of that error is with the end user of the application. If I get a null, that's programmer error. Invalid values can cause things like stack overflows, out of memory errors, parsing exceptions, etc. Indeed, most errors generally present, at some point, as an invalid value in some method call. For this reason I see IAE as actually the MOST GENERAL of all exceptions under RuntimeException. Actually, other invalid arguments can result in all kinds of other exceptions. UnknownHostException, FileNotFoundException, a variety of syntax error exceptions, IndexOutOfBoundsException, authentication failures, etc., etc. In general, I feel NPE is much maligned because traditionally has been associated with code that fails to follow the fail fast principle. That, plus the JDK's failure to populate NPE's with a message string really has created a strong negative sentiment that isn't well founded. Indeed, the difference between NPE and IAE from a runtime perspective is strictly the name. From that perspective, the more precise you are with the name, the more clarity you give to the caller.","NPE (NullPointerException) is preferred over IAE (IllegalArgumentException) for a null parameter because it is more specific about the nature of the error, and programmer error (null pointer) is distinct from invalid user input.",,"In general, I feel NPE is much maligned because traditionally has been associated with code that fails to follow the fail fast principle."

Depending on your answer, one of the following sets ofsettings should work for you: <li><strong>For tab characters that appear 4-spaces-wide</strong>: If you're using actual tab character in your source code you probably also want these settings (these are actually the defaults, but you may want to set them defensively): Finally, if you want an indent to correspond to a single tab, you should also use: <li><strong>For indents that consist of 4 space characters</strong> but are entered with the tab key: <strong>To make the above settings permanent addthese lines to your vimrc.</strong> In case you need to make adjustments, or would simply like to understand what these options all mean, here's a breakdown of what each option means: The width of a hard tabstop measured in ""spaces"" -- effectively the (maximum) width of an actual tab character.

This is also used by things like the <code>=</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> commands. Setting this to a non-zero value other than <code>tabstop</code> will make the tab key (in insert mode)   insert a combination of spaces (and possibly tabs) to <em>simulate</em> tab stops at this width. Enabling this will make the tab key (in insert mode) insert spaces instead of   tab characters. This also affects the behavior of the <code>retab</code> command.

2067472,What is JSONP all about?,"Because you can ask the server to append a prefix to the returned JSON object. E.g <code>function_prefix(json_object);</code> in order for the browser to <code>eval</code> ""inline"" the JSON string as an expression. This trick makes it possible for the server to ""inject"" javascript code directly in the Client browser and this with bypassing the ""same origin"" restrictions. In other words, you can have cross-domain data exchange. Normally, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> doesn't permit cross-domain data-exchange directly (one needs to go through a server in the same domain) whereas: <code>&lt;script src=""some_other_domain/some_data.js&amp;prefix=function_prefix</code>>` one can access data from a domain different than from the origin. Also worth noting: even though the server should be considered as ""trusted"" before attempting that sort of ""trick"", the side-effects of possible change in object format etc. can be contained. If a <code>function_prefix</code> (i.e. a proper js function) is used to receive the JSON object, the said function can perform checks before accepting/further processing the returned data.","JSONP allows cross-domain data exchange by appending a prefix to the returned JSON object, enabling the server to ""inject"" JavaScript code into the client browser, bypassing same-origin restrictions.",,"In other words, you can have cross-domain data exchange."
2067472,What is JSONP all about?,"It's actually not too complicated... Say you're on domain example.com, and you want to make a request to domain example.net. To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland. The one item that bypasses this limitation is &lt;script&gt; tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really do anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated. Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle. For example, say the server expects a parameter called ""callback"" to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like: Without JSONP, this might return some basic JavaScript object, like so: However, with JSONP, when the server receives the ""callback"" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this: As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function: And now, when the script is loaded, it'll be evaluated, and your function will be executed. Voila, cross-domain requests! It's also worth noting the one major issue with JSONP: you lose a lot of control of the request. For example, there is no ""nice"" way to get proper failure codes back. As a result, you end up using timers to monitor the request, etc, which is always a bit suspect. The proposition for JSONRequest is a great solution to allowing cross domain scripting, maintaining security, and allowing proper control of the request. These days (2015), CORS is the recommended approach vs. JSONRequest. JSONP is still useful for older browser support, but given the security implications, unless you have no choice CORS is the better choice.","JSONP is a technique that allows cross-domain requests by wrapping server responses in a JavaScript function, allowing the client to execute a callback function with the server's response. It works by passing a ""callback"" parameter to the server, which returns the response wrapped in the specified function. This allows the client to handle the response, but also loses control over the request and error handling.",,"When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page.

Let me explain. Many library routines are implemented so that they allow certain parameters to be callables (of whom lambda is one). The idea is that the actual value will be computed only at the time when it's going to be used (rather that when it's called). An (contrived) example might help to illustrate the point. Suppose you have a routine which which was going to do log a given timestamp. You want the routine to use the current time minus 30 minutes. You'd call it like so Now suppose the actual function is going to be called only when a certain event occurs and you want the timestamp to be computed only at that time. You can do this like so Assuming the <code>log_timestamp</code> can handle callables like this, it will evaluate this when it needs it and you'll get the timestamp at that time. There are of course alternate ways to do this (using the <code>operator</code> module for example) but I hope I've conveyed the point. Update: Here is a slightly more concrete real world example.

2095397,"What is the difference between JSF, Servlet and JSP?","See http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-137059.html JSP technology is part of the Java   technology family. JSP pages are   compiled into servlets and may call   JavaBeans components (beans) or   Enterprise JavaBeans components   (enterprise beans) to perform   processing on the server. As such, JSP   technology is a key component in a   highly scalable architecture for   web-based applications. See https://jcp.org/en/introduction/faq A: JavaServer Faces technology is a   framework for building user interfaces   for web applications. JavaServer Faces   technology includes: A set of APIs for: representing UI   components and managing their state,   handling events and input validation,   defining page navigation, and   supporting internationalization and   accessibility.

JSF is a set of tags you can use with JSP.
2095397,"What is the difference between JSF, Servlet and JSP?","JSP (JavaServer Pages) JSP is a Java view technology running on the server machine which allows you to write template text in client side languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ect.). JSP supports taglibs, which are backed by pieces of Java code that let you control the page flow or output dynamically. A well-known taglib is JSTL. JSP also supports Expression Language, which can be used to access backend data (via attributes available in the page, request, session and application scopes), mostly in combination with taglibs. When a JSP is requested for the first time or when the web app starts up, the servlet container will compile it into a class extending <code>HttpServlet</code> and use it during the web app's lifetime. You can find the generated source code in the server's work directory. In for example Tomcat, it's the <code>/work</code> directory. On a JSP request, the servlet container will execute the compiled JSP class and send the generated output (usually just HTML/CSS/JS) through the web server over a network to the client side, which in turn displays it in the web browser. Servlets Servlet is a Java application programming interface (API) running on the server machine, which intercepts requests made by the client and generates/sends a response. A well-known example is the <code>HttpServlet</code> which provides methods to hook on HTTP requests using the popular HTTP methods such as <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>. You can configure <code>HttpServlet</code>s to listen to a certain HTTP URL pattern, which is configurable in <code>web.xml</code>, or more recently with Java EE 6, with <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation. When a Servlet is first requested or during web app startup, the servlet container will create an instance of it and keep it in memory during the web app's lifetime. The same instance will be reused for every incoming request whose URL matches the servlet's URL pattern. You can access the request data by <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and handle the response by <code>HttpServletResponse</code>. Both objects are available as method arguments inside any of the overridden methods of <code>HttpServlet</code>, such as <code>doGet()</code> and <code>doPost()</code>. JSF (JavaServer Faces) JSF is a component based MVC framework which is built on top of the Servlet API and provides components via taglibs which can be used in JSP or any other Java based view technology such as Facelets. Facelets is much more suited to JSF than JSP. It namely provides great templating capabilities such as composite components, while JSP basically only offers the <code>&lt;jsp:include&gt;</code> for templating, so that you're forced to create custom components with raw Java code (which is a bit opaque and a lot of tedious work in JSF) when you want to replace a repeated group of components with a single component. Since JSF 2.0, JSP has been deprecated as view technology in favor of Facelets. As being a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, JSF provides the <code>FacesServlet</code> as the sole request-response Controller. It takes all the standard and tedious HTTP request/response work from your hands, such as gathering user input, validating/converting them, putting them in model objects, invoking actions and rendering the response. This way you end up with basically a JSP or Facelets (XHTML) page for View and a JavaBean class as Model. The JSF components are used to bind the view with the model (such as your ASP.NET web control does) and the <code>FacesServlet</code> uses the JSF component tree to do all the work.

2123514,java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot (forward | sendRedirect | create session) after response has been committed,"A common misunderstanding among starters is that they think that the call of a <code>forward()</code>, <code>sendRedirect()</code>, or <code>sendError()</code> would magically exit and ""jump"" out of the method block, hereby ignoring the remnant of the code. For example: BIGBLOCK This is thus actually not true. They do certainly not behave differently than any other Java methods (expect of <code>System#exit()</code> of course). When the <code>someCondition</code> in above example is <code>true</code> and you're thus calling <code>forward()</code> after <code>sendRedirect()</code> or <code>sendError()</code> on the same request/response, then the chance is <strong>big</strong> that you will get the exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot forward after response has been committed If the <code>if</code> statement calls a <code>forward()</code> and you're afterwards calling <code>sendRedirect()</code> or <code>sendError()</code>, then below exception will be thrown: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot call sendRedirect() after the response has been committed To fix this, you need either to add a <code>return;</code> statement afterwards BIGBLOCK ... or to introduce an else block.

This can be inside the same servlet before the particular code line, but also in any servlet or filter which was been called before the particular servlet.

Another probable cause is that the servlet writes to the response while a <code>forward()</code> will be called, or has been called in the very same method. BIGBLOCK The response buffer size defaults in most server to 2KB, so if you write more than 2KB to it, then it will be committed and <code>forward()</code> will fail the same way: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot forward after response has been committed Solution is obvious, just don't write to the response in the servlet.

In this example, the <code>$server</code> gets a default value if the script is called without it, script stops if you omit the <code>-username</code> parameter and asks for terminal input if <code>-password</code> is omitted.

2130416,What are the applications of binary trees?,"When most people talk about binary trees, they're more often than not thinking about binary <em>search</em> trees, so I'll cover that first. A non-balanced binary search tree is actually useful for little more than educating students about data structures. That's because, unless the data is coming in in a relatively random order, the tree can easily degenerate into its worst-case form, which is a linked list, since simple binary trees are <em>not</em> balanced. A good case in point: I once had to fix some software which loaded its data into a binary tree for manipulation and searching. It wrote the data out in sorted form: BIGBLOCK so that, when reading it back in, ended up with the following tree: BIGBLOCK which is the degenerate form. If you go looking for Frank in that tree, you'll have to search all six nodes before you find him. Binary trees become truly useful when you balance them. This involves rotating sub-trees through their root node so that the height difference between any two sub-trees is less than or equal to 1. Adding those names above one at a time into a balanced tree would give you the following sequence: BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK You can actually see whole sub-trees rotating to the left as the entries are added and this gives you a balanced binary tree in which the worst case lookup is O(log N) rather than O(N) as the degenerate form gives. At no point does the highest NULL (<code>=</code>) differ from the lowest by more than one level. And, in the final tree above, you can find Frank by only looking at three nodes (<code>Chloe</code>, <code>Edwina</code> and, finally, <code>Frank</code>). Of course, they become even more useful when you make them balanced <em>multi-way</em> trees rather than binary tress. That means that each node holds more than one item (technically, they hold N items and N+1 pointers, a binary tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree  with 1 item and 2 pointers). With a three-way tree, you end up with: BIGBLOCK This is typically used in maintaining keys for an index of items. I've written database software optimised for the hardware where a node is exactly the size of a disk block (say, 512 bytes) and you put as many keys as you can into a single node. The <em>pointers</em> in this case were actually record numbers into a fixed-length-record direct-access file separate from the index file (so record number <code>X</code> could be found by just seeking to <code>X * record_length</code>). For example, if the pointers are 4 bytes and the key size is 10, the number of keys in a 512-byte node is 36. That's 36 keys (360 bytes) and 37 pointers (148 bytes) for a total of 508 bytes with 4 bytes wasted per node. The use of multi-way keys introduces the complexity of a two-phase search (multi-way search to find the correct node combined with a small sequential search to find the correct key in the node) but the advantage in doing less disk I/O more than makes up for this. I see no reason to do this for an in-memory structure, you'd be better off sticking with a balanced binary tree and keeping your code simple. Also keep in mind that the advantages of O(log N) over O(N) don't really appear when your data sets are small. If you're using a multi-way tree to store the fifteen people in your address book, it's probably overkill. The advantages come when you're storing something like every order from your hundred thousand customers over the last ten years. The whole point of big-O notation is to indicate what happens as the N approaches infinity. Some people may disagree but it's even okay to use bubble sort if you're sure the data sets will stay below a certain size, as long as nothing else is readily available :-) As to other uses for binary trees, there are a great many, such as: <li>Binary heaps where higher keys are <em>above or equal to</em> lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right); <li>Hash trees, similar to hash tables; <li>Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages; <li>Huffman trees for compression of data; <li>Routing trees for network traffic.

28002,Regular cast vs. static_cast vs. dynamic_cast,"static_cast <code>static_cast</code> is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. <code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Example: In this example, you know that you passed a <code>MyClass</code> object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this. dynamic_cast <code>dynamic_cast</code> is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a <code>bad_cast</code> exception is thrown in that case). You cannot use <code>dynamic_cast</code> if you downcast (cast to a derived class) and the argument type is not polymorphic. For example, the following code is not valid, because <code>Base</code> doesn't contain any virtual function: An ""up-cast"" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both <code>static_cast</code> and <code>dynamic_cast</code>, and also without any cast, as an ""up-cast"" is an implicit conversion. Regular Cast These casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering <code>dynamic_cast</code>. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of <code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code> and <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use <code>dynamic_cast</code>. In addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the ""equivalent"" <code>static_cast</code> sequence would give you a compile-time error for that. Some people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity. I use them for numeric casts only, and use the appropriate C++ casts when user defined types are involved, as they provide stricter checking.","There are three types of casts in C++:

1. `static_cast`: Performs no runtime checks, used when the type is known.
2. `dynamic_cast`: Performs runtime checks, returns null or throws an exception if the cast fails, used when the type is unknown.
3. Regular cast (C-style cast): Combines multiple casts, but is less safe and less preferred, as it doesn't use `dynamic_cast`.",,"<code>static_cast</code> is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. <code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks.

It's basically useless from a practical standpoint, but it is an interesting way to think of such expressions.

2223386,Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?,"Overriding depends on having an instance of a class. The point of polymorphism is that you can subclass a class and the objects implementing those subclasses will have different behaviors for the same methods defined in the superclass (and overridden in the subclasses). A static method is not associated with any instance of a class so the concept is not applicable. There were two considerations driving Java's design that impacted this. One was a concern with performance: there had been a lot of criticism of Smalltalk about it being too slow (garbage collection and polymorphic calls being part of that) and Java's creators were determined to avoid that. Another was the decision that the target audience for Java was C++ developers. Making static methods work the way they do had the benefit of familiarity for C++ programmers and was also very fast, because there's no need to wait until runtime to figure out which method to call.","Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods because they're not associated with instances, making polymorphism inapplicable, and were designed for performance and familiarity with C++ developers.",,One was a concern with performance: there had been a lot of criticism of Smalltalk about it being too slow (garbage collection and polymorphic calls being part of that) and Java's creators were determined to avoid that.

But you can not <em>override</em> a static method, because class are no first-class object. You can use reflection to get the class of an object at run-time, but the object that you get does not parallel the class hierarchy. BIGBLOCK You can reflect over the classes, but it stops there. You don't invoke a static method by using <code>clazz1.staticMethod()</code>, but using <code>MyClass.staticMethod()</code>.

A static method is a global function; as a consequence there is also no notion of polymorphism and, therefore, method overriding makes no sense. But this could be possible if <code>MyClass</code> was an object at run-time on which you invoke a method, as in Smalltalk (or maybe JRuby as one comment suggest, but I know nothing of JRuby). Oh yeah... one more thing. You can invoke a static method through an object <code>obj1.staticMethod()</code> but that really syntactic sugar for <code>MyClass.staticMethod()</code> and should be avoided.

Yes, yes, I understand that non-static methods are attached to an instance while static methods are attached to a class, etc etc. Still, consider the following code: BIGBLOCK This code will not work as you might expect. Namely, SpecialEmployee's get a 2% bonus just like regular employees. But if you remove the ""static""s, then SpecialEmployee's get a 3% bonus. (Admittedly, this example is poor coding style in that in real life you would likely want the bonus multiplier to be in a database somewhere rather than hard-coded. But that's just because I didn't want to bog down the example with a lot of code irrelevant to the point.) It seems quite plausible to me that you might want to make getBonusMultiplier static. Perhaps you want to be able to display the bonus multiplier for all the categories of employees, without needing to have an instance of an employee in each category. What would be the point of searching for such example instances? What if we are creating a new category of employee and don't have any employees assigned to it yet? This is quite logically a static function. But it doesn't work. And yes, yes, I can think of any number of ways to rewrite the above code to make it work. My point is not that it creates an unsolvable problem, but that it creates a trap for the unwary programmer, because the language does not behave as I think a reasonable person would expect. Perhaps if I tried to write a compiler for an OOP language, I would quickly see why implementing it so that static functions can be overriden would be difficult or impossible. Or perhaps there is some good reason why Java behaves this way. Can anyone point out an advantage to this behavior, some category of problem that is made easier by this? I mean, don't just point me to the Java language spec and say ""see, this is documented how it behaves"". I know that. But is there a good reason why it SHOULD behave this way? (Besides the obvious ""making it work right was too hard""...) <strong>Update</strong> @VicKirk: If you mean that this is ""bad design"" because it doesn't fit how Java handles statics, my reply is, ""Well, duh, of course."" As I said in my original post, it doesn't work. But if you mean that it is bad design in the sense that there would be something fundamentally wrong with a language where this worked, i.e. where statics could be overridden just like virtual functions, that this would somehow introduce an ambiguity or it would be impossible to implement efficiently or some such, I reply, ""Why? What's wrong with the concept?"" I think the example I give is a very natural thing to want to do. I have a class that has a function that does not depend on any instance data, and which I might very reasonably want to call independent of an instance, as well as wanting to call from within an instance method. Why should this not work? I've run into this situation a fair number of times over the years. In practice I get around it by making the function virtual, and then creating a static method whose only purpose in life is to be a static method that passes the call on to the virtual method with a dummy instance. That seems like a very roundabout way to get there.","Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods because it can lead to unexpected behavior, as shown by an example where a static method is overridden but still behaves like the superclass's static method.",,"Personally I think this is a flaw in the design of Java. My point is not that it creates an unsolvable problem, but that it creates a trap for the unwary programmer, because the language does not behave as I think a reasonable person would expect."

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so. Pros: Your code gets decoupled so you can easily exchange implementations of an interface with alternative implementations It is a strong motivator for coding against interfaces instead of implementations It's very easy to write unit tests for your code because it depends on nothing else than the objects it accepts in its constructor/setters and you can easily initialize them with the right objects in isolation. Cons: IoC not only inverts the control flow in your program, it also clouds it considerably. This means you can no longer just read your code and jump from one place to another because the connections that would normally be in your code are not in the code anymore. Instead it is in XML configuration files or annotations and in the code of your IoC container that interprets these metadata. There arises a new class of bugs where you get your XML config or your annotations wrong and you can spend a lot of time finding out why your IoC container injects a null reference into one of your objects under certain conditions. Personally I see the strong points of IoC and I really like them but I tend to avoid IoC whenever possible because it turns your software into a collection of classes that no longer constitute a ""real"" program but just something that needs to be put together by XML configuration or annotation metadata and would fall (and falls) apart without it.","Inversion of Control (IoC) has pros (decoupling, easier unit testing) and cons (clouded control flow, potential for configuration errors).",,"Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so.

2297403,What is the difference between HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME in PHP?,"The <code>HTTP_HOST</code> is obtained from the HTTP request header and this is what the client actually used as ""target host"" of the request. The <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is defined in server config. Which one to use depends on what you need it for. You should now however realize that the one is a client-controlled value which may thus not be reliable for use in business logic and the other is a server-controlled value which is more reliable. You however need to ensure that the webserver in question has the <code>SERVER_NAME</code> correctly configured. Taking Apache HTTPD as an example, here's an extract from its documentation: If no <code>ServerName</code> is specified, then the server attempts to deduce the hostname by performing a reverse lookup on the IP address. If no port is specified in the <code>ServerName</code>, then the server will use the port from the incoming request. For optimal reliability and predictability, you should specify an explicit hostname and port using the <code>ServerName</code> directive. Update: after checking the answer of Pekka on your question which contains a link to bobince's answer that PHP would always return <code>HTTP_HOST</code>'s value for <code>SERVER_NAME</code>, which goes against my own PHP 4.x + Apache HTTPD 1.2.x experiences from a couple of years ago, I blew some dust from my current XAMPP environment on Windows XP (Apache HTTPD 2.2.1 with PHP 5.2.8), started it, created a PHP page which prints the both values, created a Java test application using <code>URLConnection</code> to modify the <code>Host</code> header and tests taught me that this is indeed (incorrectly) the case. After first suspecting PHP and digging in some PHP bug reports regarding the subject, I learned that the root of the problem is in web server used, that it incorrectly returned HTTP <code>Host</code> header when <code>SERVER_NAME</code> was requested. So I dug into Apache HTTPD bug reports using various keywords regarding the subject and I finally found a related bug. This behaviour was introduced since around Apache HTTPD 1.3. You need to set <code>UseCanonicalName</code> directive to <code>on</code> in the <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> entry of the <code>ServerName</code> in <code>httpd.conf</code> (also check the warning at the bottom of the document! ). This worked for me. Summarized, <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is more reliable, but you're dependent on the server config!","The main difference between HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME in PHP is that HTTP_HOST is obtained from the HTTP request header and is client-controlled, while SERVER_NAME is defined in the server config and is more reliable.

2305966,"Why do I get the ""Unhandled exception type IOException""?","Java has a feature called ""checked exceptions"". That means that there are certain kinds of exceptions, namely those that subclass Exception but not RuntimeException, such that if a method may throw them, it must list them in its throws declaration, say: void readData() throws IOException. IOException is one of those. Thus, when you are calling a method that lists IOException in its throws declaration, you must either list it in your own throws declaration or catch it. The rationale for the presence of checked exceptions is that for some kinds of exceptions, you must not ignore the fact that they may happen, because their happening is quite a regular situation, not a program error. So, the compiler helps you not to forget about the possibility of such an exception being raised and requires you to handle it in some way.

2223386,Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?,"In Java (and many OOP languages, but I cannot speak for all; and some do not have static at all) all methods have a fixed signature - the parameters and types. In a virtual method, the first parameter is implied: a reference to the object itself and when called from within the object, the compiler automatically adds <code>this</code>. There is no difference for static methods - they still have a fixed signature. However, by declaring the method static you have explicitly stated that the compiler must not include the implied object parameter at the beginning of that signature. Therefore, any other code that calls this must <em>must not attempt to put a reference to an object on the stack</em>. If it did do that, then the method execution would not work since the parameters would be in the wrong place - shifted by one - on the stack. Because of this difference between the two; virtual methods always have a reference to the context object (i.e. <code>this</code>) so then it is possible to reference anything within the heap that belong to that instance of the object. But with static methods, since there is no reference passed, that method cannot access any object variables and methods since the context is not known. If you wish that Java would change the definition so that a object context is passed in for every method, static or virtual, then you would in essence have only virtual methods. As someone asked in a comment to the op - what is your reason and purpose for wanting this feature? I do not know Ruby much, as this was mentioned by the OP, I did some research. I see that in Ruby classes are really a special kind of object and one can create (even dynamically) new methods. Classes are full class objects in Ruby, they are not in Java. This is just something you will have to accept when working with Java (or C#). These are not dynamic languages, though C# is adding some forms of dynamic. In reality, Ruby does not have ""static"" methods as far as I could find - in that case these are methods on the singleton class object. You can then override this singleton with a new class and the methods in the previous class object will call those defined in the new class (correct?). So if you called a method in the context of the original class it still would only execute the original statics, but calling a method in the derived class, would call methods either from the parent or sub-class. Interesting and I can see some value in that. It takes a different thought pattern. Since you are working in Java, you will need to adjust to that way of doing things. Why they did this? Well, probably to improve performance at the time based on the technology and understanding that was available. Computer languages are constantly evolving. Go back far enough and there is no such thing as OOP. In the future, there will be other new ideas. <strong>EDIT</strong>: One other comment. Now that I see the differences and as I Java/C# developer myself, I can understand why the answers you get from Java developers may be confusing if you are coming from a language like Ruby. Java <code>static</code> methods are not the same as Ruby <code>class</code> methods. Java developers will have a hard time understanding this, as will conversely those who work mostly with a language like Ruby/Smalltalk. I can see how this would also be greatly confusing by the fact that Java also uses ""class method"" as another way to talk about static methods but this same term is used differently by Ruby. Java does not have Ruby style class methods (sorry); Ruby does not have Java style static methods which are really just old procedural style functions, as found in C. By the way - thanks for the question! I learned something new for me today about class methods (Ruby style).","Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods because they don't have an implied ""this"" reference like virtual methods do. This means they can't access object variables and methods, and attempting to do so would shift the parameters on the stack. Java's design choice is rooted in performance and the language's history, and it's a fundamental difference from languages like Ruby that have dynamic methods and a different approach to class objects.",,"In a virtual method, the first parameter is implied: a reference to the object itself and when called from within the object, the compiler automatically adds <code>this</code>.

2422468,How to upload files to server using JSP/Servlet?,"Introduction To browse and select a file for upload you need a HTML <code>&lt;input type=""file""&gt;</code> field in the form. As stated in the HTML specification you have to use the <code>POST</code> method and the <code>enctype</code> attribute of the form has to be set to <code>""multipart/form-data""</code>. After submitting such a form, the binary multipart form data is available in the request body in a different format than when the <code>enctype</code> isn't set. Before Servlet 3.0, the Servlet API didn't natively support <code>multipart/form-data</code>. It supports only the default form enctype of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. The <code>request.getParameter()</code> and consorts would all return <code>null</code> when using multipart form data. This is where the well known Apache Commons FileUpload came into the picture. Don't manually parse it! You can in theory parse the request body yourself based on <code>ServletRequest#getInputStream()</code>. However, this is a precise and tedious work which requires precise knowledge of RFC2388. You shouldn't try to do this on your own or copypaste some homegrown library-less code found elsewhere on the Internet. Many online sources have failed hard in this, such as roseindia.net. See also uploading of pdf file. You should rather use a real library which is used (and implicitly tested!) by millions of users for years. Such a library has proven its robustness. When you're already on Servlet 3.0 or newer, use native API If you're using at least Servlet 3.0 (Tomcat 7, Jetty 9, JBoss AS 6, GlassFish 3, etc), then you can just use standard API provided <code>HttpServletRequest#getPart()</code> to collect the individual multipart form data items (most Servlet 3.0 implementations actually use Apache Commons FileUpload under the covers for this!). Also, normal form fields are available by <code>getParameter()</code> the usual way. First annotate your servlet with <code>@MultipartConfig</code> in order to let it recognize and support <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests and thus get <code>getPart()</code> to work: Then, implement its <code>doPost()</code> as follows: Note the <code>Path#getFileName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. In case you have a <code>&lt;input type=""file"" name=""file"" multiple=""true"" /&gt;</code> for multi-file upload, collect them as below (unfortunately there is no such method as <code>request.getParts(""file"")</code>): When you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, manually get submitted file name Note that <code>Part#getSubmittedFileName()</code> was introduced in Servlet 3.1 (Tomcat 8, Jetty 9, WildFly 8, GlassFish 4, etc). If you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, then you need an additional utility method to obtain the submitted file name. Note the MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. When you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet, use Apache Commons FileUpload If you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet (isn't it about time to upgrade? ), the common practice is to make use of Apache Commons FileUpload to parse the multpart form data requests. It has an excellent User Guide and FAQ (carefully go through both). There's also the O'Reilly (""cos"") <code>MultipartRequest</code>, but it has some (minor) bugs and isn't actively maintained anymore for years. I wouldn't recommend using it. Apache Commons FileUpload is still actively maintained and currently very mature. In order to use Apache Commons FileUpload, you need to have at least the following files in your webapp's <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code>: <code>commons-fileupload.jar</code> <code>commons-io.jar</code> Your initial attempt failed most likely because you forgot the commons IO. Here's a kickoff example how the <code>doPost()</code> of your <code>UploadServlet</code> may look like when using Apache Commons FileUpload: It's very important that you don't call <code>getParameter()</code>, <code>getParameterMap()</code>, <code>getParameterValues()</code>, <code>getInputStream()</code>, <code>getReader()</code>, etc on the same request beforehand. Otherwise the servlet container will read and parse the request body and thus Apache Commons FileUpload will get an empty request body. See also a.o. ServletFileUpload#parseRequest(request) returns an empty list. Note the <code>FilenameUtils#getName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. Alternatively you can also wrap this all in a <code>Filter</code> which parses it all automagically and put the stuff back in the parametermap of the request so that you can continue using <code>request.getParameter()</code> the usual way and retrieve the uploaded file by <code>request.getAttribute()</code>. You can find an example in this blog article. Workaround for GlassFish3 bug of <code>getParameter()</code> still returning <code>null</code> Note that Glassfish versions older than 3.1.2 had a bug wherein the <code>getParameter()</code> still returns <code>null</code>. If you are targeting such a container and can't upgrade it, then you need to extract the value from <code>getPart()</code> with help of this utility method: Saving uploaded file (don't use <code>getRealPath()</code> nor <code>part.write()</code>!)

The disadvantage is the result can be wrong (data which hasn't been committed yet could be returned) and there is no guarantee that the result is repeatable. If you care about accuracy, don't use this. More information is on MSDN: Implements dirty read, or isolation level 0 locking, which means that no shared locks are issued and no exclusive locks are honored. When this option is set, it is possible to read uncommitted or dirty data; values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction. This option has the same effect as setting NOLOCK on all tables in all SELECT statements in a transaction. This is the least restrictive of the four isolation levels.","The READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level can be faster, but it risks returning incorrect data and has no guarantee of repeatable results, making it unsuitable for accuracy-critical applications.",,"If you care about accuracy, don't use this. This is the least restrictive of the four isolation levels."
2471055,Why use a READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level?,"This isolation level allows dirty reads. One transaction may see uncommitted changes made by some other transaction. To maintain the highest level of isolation, a DBMS usually acquires locks on data, which may result in a loss of concurrency and a high locking overhead. This isolation level relaxes this property. You may want to check out the Wikipedia article on <code>READ UNCOMMITTED</code> for a few examples and further reading. You may also be interested in checking out Jeff Atwood's blog article on how he and his team tackled a deadlock issue in the early days of Stack Overflow.

I would never recommend using <code>nolock</code>  as a general ""good for what ails you""  snake oil fix for any database  deadlocking problems you may have. You  should try to diagnose the source of  the problem first.

Quoting Jeff again: Snapshots rely on an entirely new data change tracking method ... more than just a slight logical change, it requires the server to handle the data physically differently. Once this new data change tracking method is enabled, it creates a copy, or snapshot of every data change. <strong>By reading these snapshots rather than live data at times of contention, Shared Locks are no longer needed on reads, and overall database performance may increase.</strong>","The READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level allows dirty reads, relaxing the locking property to maintain high concurrency.

2480650,Role of Bias in Neural Networks,"Two different kinds of parameters can  be adjusted during the training of an  ANN, the weights and the value in the  activation functions. This is  impractical and it would be easier if  only one of the parameters should be  adjusted. To cope with this problem a  bias neuron is invented. The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1. Since the bias neuron  emits 1 the weights, connected to the  bias neuron, are added directly to the  combined sum of the other weights  (equation 2.1), just like the t value  in the activation functions.1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. Consider the AND boolean function represented by the following neural network: ANN http://www.aihorizon.com/images/essays/perceptron.gif <li><em>w0</em> corresponds to <em>b</em>. <li><em>w1</em> corresponds to <em>x1</em>. <li><em>w2</em> corresponds to <em>x2</em>. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions. For example, if we assume boolean values  of 1 (true) and -1 (false), then one  way to use a two-input perceptron to  implement the AND function is to set  the weights w0 = -3, and w1 = w2 = .5. This perceptron can be made to  represent the OR function instead by  altering the threshold to w0 = -.3. In  fact, AND and OR can be viewed as  special cases of m-of-n functions:  that is, functions where at least m of  the n inputs to the perceptron must be  true. The OR function corresponds to  m = 1 and the AND function to m = n.  Any m-of-n function is easily  represented using a perceptron by  setting all input weights to the same  value (e.g., 0.5) and then setting the  threshold w0 accordingly. Perceptrons can represent all of the  primitive boolean functions AND, OR,  NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR). Machine Learning- Tom Mitchell) The threshold is the bias and <em>w0</em> is the weight associated with the bias/threshold neuron.","A bias neuron is a neuron in a neural network that emits a constant value (1) and is connected to all neurons in the next layer, allowing for easier adjustment of the network's behavior by controlling the threshold value (bias) without affecting the weights.

2480650,Role of Bias in Neural Networks,"I think that biases are almost always helpful. In effect, <strong>a bias value allows you to shift the activation function to the left or right</strong>, which may be critical for successful learning. It might help to look at a simple example. Consider this 1-input, 1-output network that has no bias: The output of the network is computed by multiplying the input (x) by the weight (w0) and passing the result through some kind of activation function (e.g. a sigmoid function.) Here is the function that this network computes, for various values of w0: Changing the weight w0 essentially changes the ""steepness"" of the sigmoid. That's useful, but what if you wanted the network to output 0 when x is 2? Just changing the steepness of the sigmoid won't really work -- <strong>you want to be able to shift the entire curve to the right</strong>. That's exactly what the bias allows you to do. If we add a bias to that network, like so: ...then the output of the network becomes sig(w0*x + w1*1.0). Here is what the output of the network looks like for various values of w1: Having a weight of -5 for w1 shifts the curve to the right, which allows us to have a network that outputs 0 when x is 2.","Biases in neural networks are helpful as they allow shifting the activation function to the left or right, enabling the network to output specific values at specific inputs.",,"In effect, <strong>a bias value allows you to shift the activation function to the left or right</strong>, which may be critical for successful learning."

2559527,Non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context,"You must understand the difference between a class and an instance of that class. If you see a car on the street, you know immediately that it's a car even if you can't see which model or type. This is because you compare what you see with the class ""car"". The class contains which is similar to all cars. Think of it as a template or an idea. At the same time, the car you see is an instance of the class ""car"" since it has all the properties which you expect: There is someone driving it, it has an engine, wheels. So the class says ""all cars have a color"" and the instance says ""this specific car is red"". In the OO world, you define the class and inside the class, you define a field of type <code>Color</code>. When the class is instantiated (when you create a specific instance), memory is reserved for the color and you can give this specific instance a color. Since these attributes are specific, they are non-static. Static fields and methods are shared with all instances. They are for values which are specific to the class and not a specific instance. For methods, this usually are global helper methods (like <code>Integer.parseInt()</code>). For fields, it's usually constants (like car types, i.e. something where you have a limited set which doesn't change often). To solve your problem, you need to instantiate an instance (create an object) of your class so the runtime can reserve memory for the instance (otherwise, different instances would overwrite each other which you don't want). In your case, try this code as a starting block: The new <code>main()</code> method creates an instance of the class it contains (sounds strange but since <code>main()</code> is created with the class instead of with the instance, it can do this) and then calls an instance method (<code>run()</code>).","You must understand the difference between a class and an instance of that class. To solve the error, instantiate the class and use instance methods, not static ones.",,"Static fields and methods are shared with all instances.

2559527,Non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context,"I will try to explain the static thing to you. First of all static variables do not belong to any particular instance of the class. They are recognized with the name of the class. Static methods again do not belong again to any particular instance. They can access only static variables. Imagine you call MyClass.myMethod() and myMethod is a static method. If you use non-static variables inside the method, how the hell on earth would it know which variables to use? That's why you can use from static methods only static variables. I repeat again they do NOT belong to any particular instance.","Static variables and methods belong to the class, not an instance, and can only access other static elements.",,"If you use non-static variables inside the method, how the hell on earth would it know which variables to use?"

Method <code>c()</code> has no idea which instance is connected, so it cannot use non-static fields. The solution for you is that you either make your fields static or your methods non-static.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"I'd like to address the 4 points in the accepted answer, hopefully someone can explain why I'm wrong. Why is hiding dependencies in your code bad? There are already dozens of hidden dependencies (C runtime calls, OS API calls, global function calls), and singleton dependencies are easy to find (search for instance()). ""Making something global to avoid passing it around is a code smell."" Why isn't passing something around to avoid making it a singleton a code smell? If you're passing an object through 10 functions in a call stack just to avoid a singleton, is that so great? Single Responsibility Principle: I think this is a bit vague and depends on your definition of responsibility. A relevant question would be, why does adding this specific ""responsibility"" to a class matter? Why does passing an object to a class make it more tightly coupled than using that object as a singleton from within the class? Why does it change how long the state lasts? Singletons can be created or destroyed manually, so the control is still there, and you can make the lifetime the same as a non-singleton object's lifetime would be. Regarding unit tests: not all classes need to be unit tested not all classes that need to be unit tested need to change the implementation of the singleton if they do need be unit tested and do need to change the implementation, it's easy to change a class from using a singleton to having the singleton passed to it via dependency injection.","The author disagrees with the accepted answer, questioning why singletons are considered bad. They argue that hiding dependencies in code is not inherently bad, and that passing objects around to avoid singletons can be just as problematic. They also dispute the Single Responsibility Principle and the claim that singletons make unit testing difficult.",,

(And even if a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> <em>were</em> faster in <em>specific</em> situations due to some difficult-to-imagine confluence of factors, it is not functionally equivalent to an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, so you cannot simply go replacing all instances of one with the other!) Most likely your performance problems lie elsewhere, such as not having a candidate key or foreign key indexed properly. 9 tables is quite a lot to be joining so the slowdown could literally be almost anywhere. If you post your schema, we might be able to provide more details. <strong>Edit:</strong> Reflecting further on this, I could think of one circumstance under which a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> might be faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, and that is when: <li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows); <li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query. Consider this example: BIGBLOCK If you run this and view the execution plan, you'll see that the <code>INNER JOIN</code> query does indeed cost more than the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, because it satisfies the two criteria above. It's because SQL Server wants to do a hash match for the <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but does nested loops for the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>; the former is <em>normally</em> much faster, but since the number of rows is so tiny <em>and</em> there's no index to use, the hashing operation turns out to be the most expensive part of the query. You can see the same effect by writing a program in your favourite programming language to perform a large number of lookups on a list with 5 elements, vs. a hash table with 5 elements. Because of the size, the hash table version is actually slower. But increase it to 50 elements, or 5000 elements, and the list version slows to a crawl, because it's O(N) vs. O(1) for the hashtable. But change this query to be on the <code>ID</code> column instead of <code>Name</code> and you'll see a very different story. In that case, it does nested loops for both queries, but the <code>INNER JOIN</code> version is able to replace one of the clustered index scans with a seek - meaning that this will literally be <em>an order of magnitude</em> faster with a large number of rows. So the conclusion is more or less what I mentioned several paragraphs above; this is almost certainly an indexing or index coverage problem, possibly combined with one or more very small tables. Those are the only circumstances under which SQL Server <em>might</em> sometimes choose a worse execution plan for an <code>INNER JOIN</code> than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.","A LEFT JOIN is not faster than an INNER JOIN.

Whereas semaphore can be used across process space and hence it can be used for interprocess synchronization. ii) Mutex is lightweight and faster than semaphore. Futex is even faster. iii) Mutex can be acquired by same thread successfully multiple times with condition that it should release it same number of times. Other thread trying to acquire will block. Whereas in case of semaphore if same process tries to acquire it again it blocks as it can be acquired only once.","A mutex and a binary semaphore differ in scope (within process vs across processes), speed (mutex is faster), and behavior when acquiring multiple times (mutex allows, semaphore blocks).",,i) Scope __________________________ÃÂ¢________________________________ The scope of mutex is within a process address space which has created it and is used for synchronization of threads.

They are dealt with by the Garbage Collector automatically when they are not used anymore. This is a more complicated approach than C++ where the scope of a variable is entirely deterministic. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. An object can go ""out of scope"" in one function but if its value is returned, then GC would look at whether or not the calling function holds onto the return value. Setting object references to <code>null</code> is unnecessary as garbage collection works by working out which objects are being referenced by other objects. In practice, you don't have to worry about destruction, it just works and it's great :) <code>Dispose</code> must be called on all objects that implement <code>IDisposable</code> when you are finished working with them. Normally you would use a <code>using</code> block with those objects like so: BIGBLOCK <strong>EDIT</strong> On variable scope. Craig has asked whether the variable scope has any effect on the object lifetime. To properly explain that aspect of CLR, I'll need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#.

Take a look at this function: BIGBLOCK Below is the generated IL. Note that iVal2, which is defined inside the if block is actually defined at function level. Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned. BIGBLOCK C++ scope and object lifetime Whenever a C++ variable, allocated on the stack, goes out of scope it gets destructed. Remember that in C++ you can create objects on the stack or on the heap. When you create them on the stack, once execution leaves the scope, they get popped off the stack and gets destroyed. BIGBLOCK When C++ objects are created on the heap, they must be explicitly destroyed, otherwise it is a memory leak. No such problem with stack variables though. C# Object Lifetime In CLR, objects (i.e. reference types) are <strong>always</strong> created on the managed heap. This is further reinforced by object creation syntax. Consider this code snippet. BIGBLOCK In C++ this would create an instance on <code>MyClass</code> on the stack and call its default constructor. In C# it would create a reference to class <code>MyClass</code> that doesn't point to anything. The only way to create an instance of a class is by using <code>new</code> operator: BIGBLOCK In a way, C# objects are a lot like objects that are created using <code>new</code> syntax in C++ - they are created on the heap but unlike C++ objects, they are managed by the runtime, so you don't have to worry about destructing them. Since the objects are <strong>always</strong> on the heap the fact that object references (i.e. pointers) go out of scope becomes moot. There are more factors involved in determining if an object is to be collected than simply presence of references to the object. C# Object references Jon Skeet compared object references in Java to pieces of string that are attached to the balloon, which is the object. Same analogy applies to C# object references. They simply point to a location of the heap that contains the object. Thus, setting it to null has no immediate effect on the object lifetime, the balloon continues to exist, until the GC ""pops"" it. Continuing down the balloon analogy, it would seem logical that once the balloon has no strings attached to it, it can be destroyed. In fact this is exactly how reference counted objects work in non-managed languages. Except this approach doesn't work for circular references very well. Imagine two balloons that are attached together by a string but neither balloon has a string to anything else. Under simple ref counting rules, they both continue to exist, even though the whole balloon group is ""orphaned"". .NET objects are a lot like helium balloons under a roof. When the roof opens (GC runs) - the unused balloons float away, even though there might be groups of balloons that are tethered together. .NET GC uses a combination of generational GC and mark and sweep. Generational approach involves the runtime favouring to inspect objects that have been allocated most recently, as they are more likely to be unused and mark and sweep involves runtime going through the whole object graph and working out if there are object groups that are unused. This adequately deals with circular dependency problem. Also, .NET GC runs on another thread(so called finalizer thread) as it has quite a bit to do and doing that on the main thread would interrupt your program.","Objects in C# do not require manual disposal like in C++ because the Garbage Collector automatically frees memory when objects are no longer in use. However, objects that implement IDisposable should be disposed of using a using block. Variable scope in C# is different from C++ as it only has class and function level scope, not statement block scope. Objects are created on the managed heap and their lifetime is managed by the runtime, so there is no need to worry about object destruction. Setting object references to null does not affect the object's lifetime, but rather indicates to the Garbage Collector that it is no longer needed.",,"Objects never go out of scope in C# as they do in C++. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. In practice, you don't have to worry about destruction, it just works and it's great :) <strong>EDIT</strong> On variable scope. To properly explain that aspect of CLR, I'll need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#. In both languages the variable can only be used in the same scope as it was defined - class, function or a statement block enclosed by braces. The subtle difference, however, is that in C#, variables cannot be redefined in a nested block. In C++, this is perfectly legal: BIGBLOCK In C#, however you get a a compiler error: BIGBLOCK Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned.

2926869,Do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null?,"Normally, there's no need to set fields to null. I'd always recommend disposing unmanaged resources however. From experience I'd also advise you to do the following: <li>Unsubscribe from events if you no longer need them. <li>Set any field holding a delegate or an expression to null if it's no longer needed. I've come across some very hard to find issues that were the direct result of not following the advice above. A good place to do this is in Dispose(), but sooner is usually better. In general, if a reference exists to an object the garbage collector (GC) may take a couple of generations longer to figure out that an object is no longer in use. All the while the object remains in memory. That may not be a problem until you find that your app is using a lot more memory than you'd expect. When that happens, hook up a memory profiler to see what objects are not being cleaned up. Setting fields referencing other objects to null and clearing collections on disposal can really help the GC figure out what objects it can remove from memory. The GC will reclaim the used memory faster making your app a lot less memory hungry and faster.","There's no need to set fields to null, but it's recommended to:

* Dispose of unmanaged resources

But, I think there are fallacies abound in that argument. Read this for an interesting debate by respected individuals on the subject. Then read my reasoning here why I think Jeffery Richter is in the wrong camp. Now, on to whether or not you should set a reference to <code>null</code>. The answer is no. Let me illustrate my point with the following code. BIGBLOCK So when do you think the object referenced by <code>a</code> is eligible for collection? If you said after the call to <code>a = null</code> then you are wrong. If you said after the <code>Main</code> method completes then you are also wrong. The correct answer is that it is eligible for collection sometime <strong>during</strong> the call to <code>DoSomething</code>. That is right.

No assumptions can be made or else it will come back to bite you. Don't listen to leppie. A lot of objects don't actually implement IDisposable, so you don't have to worry about them. If they genuinely go out of scope they will be freed automatically. Also I have never come across the situation where I have had to set something to null. One thing that can happen is that a lot of objects can be held open. This can greatly increase the memory usage of your application. Sometimes it is hard to work out whether this is actually a memory leak, or whether your application is just doing a lot of stuff. Memory profile tools can help with things like that, but it can be tricky. In addition always unsubscribe from events that are not needed. Also be careful with WPF binding and controls. Not a usual situation, but I came across a situation where I had a WPF control that was being bound to an underlying object. The underlying object was large and took up a large amount of memory. The WPF control was being replaced with a new instance, and the old one was still hanging around for some reason. This caused a large memory leak. In hindsite the code was poorly written, but the point is that you want to make sure that things that are not used go out of scope. That one took a long time to find with a memory profiler as it is hard to know what stuff in memory is valid, and what shouldn't be there.","Always call Dispose to prevent memory leaks and increase application performance, especially in large enterprise applications.

109023,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"I wrote a fast bitcount macro for RISC machines in about 1990. It does not use advanced arithmetic (multiplication, division, %), memory fetches (way too slow), branches (way too slow), but it does assume the CPU has a 32-bit barrel shifter (in other words, >> 1 and >> 32 take the same amount of cycles.) It assumes that small constants (such as 6, 12, 24) cost nothing to load into the registers, or are stored in temporaries and reused over and over again. With these assumptions, it counts 32 bits in about 16 cycles/instructions on most RISC machines. Note that 15 instructions/cycles is close to a lower bound on the number of cycles or instructions, because it seems to take at least 3 instructions (mask, shift, operator) to cut the number of addends in half, so log_2(32) = 5, 5 x 3 = 15 instructions is a quasi-lowerbound. Here is a secret to the first and most complex step: so if I take the 1st column (A) above, shift it right 1 bit, and subtract it from AB, I get the output (CD). The extension to 3 bits is similar; you can check it with an 8-row boolean table like mine above if you wish.

3044315,How to set the authorization header using curl,"http://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html See part 6. HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and    password so that it can verify that you're allowed to do the request you're    doing. The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by    default) is plain text based, which means it sends username and password    only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on    the network between you and the remote server. To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication: The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers    returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even    --anyauth might be options that suit you. Sometimes your HTTP access is only available through the use of a HTTP    proxy. This seems to be especially common at various companies. A HTTP proxy    may require its own user and password to allow the client to get through to    the Internet. To specify those with curl, run something like: If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,    use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest. If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password    part, curl will prompt for the password interactively. Do note that when a program is run, its parameters might be possible to see    when listing the running processes of the system. Thus, other users may be    able to watch your passwords if you pass them as plain command line    options. There are ways to circumvent this. It is worth noting that while this is how HTTP Authentication works, very    many web sites will not use this concept when they provide logins etc. See    the Web Login chapter further below for more details on that.","To set the authorization header using curl, use the following options:

- `--user` for basic authentication
- `--ntlm` or `--digest` for different authentication methods
- `--proxy-user` for proxy authentication
- `--proxy-ntlm` or `--proxy-digest` for NTLM or Digest proxy authentication
- Leave out the password and use interactive prompting with `--user` or `--proxy-user`",,See part 6.

We then add a Bicycle, Car and Truck to the list. Next, we can loop through each Vehicle in the list, and treat them all identically, however when we access each Vehicles 'Wheels' property, the Vehicle class delegates the execution of that code to the relevant sub-class.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"Monopoly is the devil and singletons with non-readonly/mutable state are the 'real' problem... After reading Singletons are Pathological Liars as suggested in jason's answer I came across this little tidbit that provides the best presented example of how singletons are often misused. Global is bad because:   a. It causes namespace conflict   b. It exposes the state in a unwarranted fashion When it comes to Singletons   a. The explicit OO way of calling them, prevents the conflicts, so point a. is not an issue   b. Singletons without state are (like factories) are not a problem. Singletons with state can again fall in two categories, those which are immutable or write once and read many (config/property files). These are not bad. Mutable Singletons, which are kind of reference holders are the ones which you are speaking of. In the last statement he's referring to the blog's concept of 'singletons are liars'. How does this apply to Monopoly? To start a game of monopoly, first: we establish the rules first so everybody is on the same page everybody is given an equal start at the beginning of the game only one set of rules is presented to avoid confusion the rules aren't allowed to change throughout the game Now, for anybody who hasn't really played monopoly, these standards are ideal at best. A defeat in monopoly is hard to swallow because, monopoly is about money, if you lose you have to painstakingly watch the rest of the players finish the game, and losses are usually swift and crushing. So, the rules usually get twisted at some point to serve the self-interest of some of the players at the expense of the others. So you're playing monopoly with friends Bob, Joe, and Ed. You're swiftly building your empire and consuming market share at an exponential rate. Your opponents are weakening and you start to smell blood (figuratively). Your buddy Bob put all of his money into gridlocking as many low-value properties as possible but his isn't receiving a high return on investment the way he expected. Bob, as a stroke of bad luck, lands on your Boardwalk and is excised from the game. Now the game goes from friendly dice-rolling to serious business. Bob has been made the example of failure and Joe and Ed don't want to end up like 'that guy'. So, being the leading player you, all of a sudden, become the enemy. Joe and Ed start practicing under-the-table trades, behind-the-back money injections, undervalued house-swapping and generally anything to weaken you as a player until one of them rises to the top. Then, instead of one of them winning, the process starts all over. All of a sudden, a finite set of rules becomes a moving target and the game degenerates into the type of social interactions that would make up the foundation of every high-rated reality TV show since Survivor. Why, because the rules are changing and there's no consensus on how/why/what they're supposed to represent, and more importantly, there's no one person making the decisions. Every player in the game, at that point, is making his/her own rules and chaos ensues until two of the players are too tired to keep up the charade and slowly give up. So, if a rulebook for a game accurately represented a singleton, the monopoly rulebook would be an example of abuse. How does this apply to programming? Aside from all of the obvious thread-safety and synchronization issues that mutable singletons present... If you have one set of data, that is capable of being read/manipulated by multiple different sources concurrently and exists during the lifetime of the application execution, it's probably a good time to step back and ask ""am I using the right type of data structure here"". Personally, I have seen a programmer abuse a singleton by using it as some sort of twisted cross-thread database store within an application. Having worked on the code directly, I can attest that it was a slow (because of all the thread locks needed to make it thread-safe) and a nightmare to work on (because of the unpredictable/intermittent nature of synchronization bugs), and nearly impossible to test under 'production' conditions. Sure, a system could have been developed using polling/signaling to overcome some of the performance issues but that wouldn't solve the issues with testing and, why bother when a 'real' database can already accomplish the same functionality in a much more robust/scalable manner. A Singleton is only an option if you need what a singleton provides. A write-one read-only instance of an object. That same rule should cascade to the object's properties/members as well.","Singletons are problematic, especially when they have mutable state, as they can lead to thread-safety issues and make code hard to test and maintain. A better approach is to use a database or other robust data storage solution instead of a singleton.",,Monopoly is the devil and singletons with non-readonly/mutable state are the 'real' problem...

3141087,"What is meant with ""const"" at end of function declaration?","A ""const function"", denoted with the keyword <code>const</code> after a function declaration, makes it a compiler error for this class function to change a member variable of the class. However, reading of a class variables is ok inside of the function, but writing inside of this function will generate a compiler error. Another way of thinking about such ""const function"" is by viewing an class function as a normal function taking an implicit <code>this</code> pointer. So a method <code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg)</code> (without the const at the end) results in a function like <code>int Foo_Bar(Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>, and a call such as <code>Foo f; f.Bar(4)</code> will internally correspond to something like <code>Foo f; Foo_Bar(&amp;f, 4)</code>. Now adding the const at the end (<code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg) const</code>) can then be understood as a declaration with a const this pointer: <code>int Foo_Bar(const Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>. Since the type of <code>this</code> in such case is const, no modifications of member variables are possible. It is possible to loosen the ""const function"" restriction of not allowing the function to write to any variable of a class. To allow some of the variables to be writable even when the function is marked as a ""const function"", these class variables are marked with the keyword <code>mutable</code>. Thus, if a class variable is marked as mutable, and a ""const function"" writes to this variable then the code will compile cleanly and the variable is possible to change. (C++11) As usual when dealing with the <code>const</code> keyword, changing the location of the const key word in a C++ statement has entirely different meanings. The above usage of <code>const</code> only apply when adding <code>const</code> to the end of the function declaration after the parenthesis. <code>const</code> is a highly overused qualifier in C++ and the syntax and ordering is often not straightforward in combination with pointers. Some readings about <code>const</code> correctness and the <code>const</code> keyword: Const correctness The C++ 'const' Declaration: Why &amp; How","A ""const function"" declared with `const` after its parameter list in C++ means it cannot modify any non-static class member variables.

It's just a convention. Lots of libraries depend on it though. With respect to <code>Serializable</code>, from the API documentation: Serializability of a class is enabled by the class implementing the   java.io.Serializable interface. Classes that do not implement this   interface will not have any of their state serialized or deserialized.   All subtypes of a serializable class are themselves serializable. The   serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to   identify the semantics of being serializable. In other words, serializable objects can be written to streams, and hence files, object databases, anything really. Also, there is no syntactic difference between a JavaBean and another class -- a class defines a JavaBean if it follows the standards. There is a term for it because the standard allows libraries to programmatically do things with class instances you define in a predefined way. For example, if a library wants to stream any object you pass into it, it knows it can because your object is serializable (assuming the lib requires your objects be proper JavaBeans).","A JavaBean is a class that meets three conditions: all properties are private (with getters and setters), has a public no-argument constructor, and implements the `Serializable` interface, enabling it to be written to streams and files.",,"A JavaBean is just a standard All properties private (use getters/setters) A public no-argument constructor Implements <code>Serializable</code>.

3295496,What is a JavaBean exactly?,"There's a term for it to make it sound special. The reality is nowhere near so mysterious. Basically, a ""Bean"": is a serializable object (that is, it implements <code>java.io.Serializable</code>, and does so correctly), that has ""properties"" whose getters and setters are just methods with certain names (like, say, <code>getFoo()</code> is the getter for the ""Foo"" property), and has a public default constructor (so it can be created at will and configured by setting its properties). Update: As for <code>Serializable</code>:  That is nothing but a ""marker interface"" (an interface that doesn't declare any functions) that tells Java that the implementing class consents to (and implies that it is capable of) ""serialization"" -- a process that converts an instance into a stream of bytes. Those bytes can be stored in files, sent over a network connection, etc, and have enough info to allow a JVM (at least, one that knows about the object's type) to reconstruct the object later -- possibly in a different instance of the application, or even on a whole other machine! Of course, in order to do that, the class has to abide by certain limitations. Chief among them is that all instance fields must be either primitive types (int, bool, etc), instances of some class that is also serializable, or marked as <code>transient</code> so that Java won't try to include them. (This of course means that <code>transient</code> fields will not survive the trip over a stream. A class that has <code>transient</code> fields should be prepared to reinitialize them if necessary.) A class that can not abide by those limitations should not implement <code>Serializable</code> (and, IIRC, the Java compiler won't even let it do so.)","A JavaBean is a serializable object with properties that have public getters and setters, and a public default constructor, following specific naming conventions.",,"There's a term for it to make it sound special.

Apple's mobile version of WebKit, used in iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads, will scale the page to fit the screen, at which point the user can zoom in and out freely. That said, you can design your page to minimize the amount of zooming necessary. Your best bet is to make the width and height the same as the lower resolution of the iPad, since you don't know which way it's oriented; in other words, you would make your page 768x768, so that it will fit well on the iPad's screen whether it's oriented to be 1024x768 or 768x1024. More importantly, you'd want to design your page with big controls with lots of space that are easy to hit with your thumbs - you could easily design a 768x768 page that was very cluttered and therefore required lots of zooming. To accomplish this, you'll likely want to divide your controls among a number of web pages. On the other hand, it's not the most worthwhile pursuit. If while designing you find opportunities to make your page more ""finger-friendly"", then go for it...but the reality is that iPad users are very comfortable with moving around and zooming in and out of the page to get to things because it's necessary on most web sites. If anything, you probably want to design it so that it's conducive to this type of navigation. Make boxes with relevant grouped data that can be easily double-tapped to focus on, and keep related controls close to each other. iPad users will most likely appreciate a page that facilitates the familiar zoom-and-pan navigation they're accustomed to more than they will a page that has fewer controls so that they don't have to.","There's no standard iPad browser width and height, as Apple's WebKit scales pages to fit the screen, allowing users to zoom in and out.

I'm surmising that the <code>OBD2nerForm</code> code you posted is a static initializer block and that it is all generated. Based on that and on the stack trace, it seems likely that generated code is tripping up because it has found some component of your form that doesn't have the type that it is expecting. I'd do the following to try and diagnose this: Google for reports of similar problems with NetBeans generated forms. If you are running an old version of NetBeans, scan through the ""bugs fixed"" pages for more recent releases. Or just upgrade try a newer release anyway to see if that fixes the problem. Try cutting bits out of the form design until the problem ""goes away"" ... and try to figure out what the real cause is that way. Run the application under a debugger to figure out what is being (incorrectly) type cast as what. Just knowing the class names may help. And looking at the instance variables of the objects may reveal more; e.g. which specific form component is causing the problem. My suspicion is that the root cause is a combination of something a bit unusual (or incorrect) with your form design, and bugs in the NetBeans form generator that is not coping with your form.

3463426,"In C, how should I read a text file and print all strings","Two approaches leap to mind. First, don't use <code>scanf</code>.

A simple loop over the file that prints the buffer content should naturally copy the file intact. Second, use <code>fread()</code> or the common C idiom with <code>fgetc()</code>. These would process the file in fixed-size chunks or a single character at a time. If you must process the file over white-space delimited strings, then use either <code>fgets</code> or <code>fread</code> to read the file, and something like <code>strtok</code> to split the buffer at whitespace. Don't forget to handle the transition from one buffer to the next, since your target strings are likely to span the buffer boundary. If there is an external requirement to use <code>scanf</code> to do the reading, then limit the length of the string it might read with a precision field in the format specifier. In your case with a 999 byte buffer, then say <code>scanf(""%998s"", str);</code> which will write at most 998 characters to the buffer leaving room for the nul terminator. If single strings longer than your buffer are allowed, then you would have to process them in two pieces. If not, you have an opportunity to tell the user about an error politely without creating a buffer overflow security hole.

3477333,What is the difference between POST and GET?,"<code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> are two different types of HTTP requests. According to Wikipedia: GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. and POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616) section 9 Method Definitions contains more information on <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> as well as the other HTTP methods, if you are interested. In addition to explaining the intended uses of each method, the spec also provides at least one practical reason for why <code>GET</code> should only be used to retrieve data: Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing servers, proxies, and user agents will log the request URI in some place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use POST-based form submission instead Finally, an important consideration when using <code>GET</code> for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a <code>GET</code> request. So if you, for example, poll using the same <code>GET</code> request you will always get back the same results, even if the data you are querying is being updated server-side. One way to alleviate this problem is to make the URL unique for each request by appending a timestamp.","GET requests retrieve data, while POST requests submit data to be processed, typically creating or updating resources.",,"GET requests a representation of the specified resource.

667781,What is the difference between MVC and MVVM?,"MVC/MVVM is not an either/or choice. The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development. For ASP.Net, MVVM is used to two-way bind data within views. This is usually a client-side implementation (e.g. using Knockout.js). MVC on the other hand is a way of separating concerns on the server-side. For Silverlight and WPF, the MVVM pattern is more encompassing and can appear to act as a replacement for MVC (or other patterns of organising software into separate responsibilities). One assumption, that frequently came out of this pattern, was that the <code>ViewModel</code> simply replaced the controller in <code>MVC</code> (as if you could just  substitute <code>VM</code> for <code>C</code> in the acronym and all would be forgiven)... The ViewModel does not necessarily replace the need for separate Controllers. The problem is: that to be independently testable*, and especially reusable when needed, a view-model has no idea what view is displaying it, but more importantly no idea where its data is coming from. *Note: in practice Controllers remove most of the logic, from the ViewModel, that requires unit testing. The VM then becomes a dumb container that requires little, if any, testing. This is a good thing as the VM is just a bridge, between the designer and the coder, so should be kept simple. Even in MVVM, controllers will typically contain all processing logic and decide what data to display in which views using which view models. From what we have seen so far the main benefit of the ViewModel pattern to remove code from XAML code-behind to make XAML editing a more independent task. We still create controllers, as and when needed, to control (no pun intended) the overall logic of our applications. The basic MVCVM guidelines we follow are: Views display a certain shape of data. They have no idea where the data comes from. ViewModels hold a certain shape of data and commands, they do not know where the data, or code, comes from or how it is displayed. Models hold the actual data (various context, store or other methods) Controllers listen for, and publish, events. Controllers provide the logic that controls what data is seen and where. Controllers provide the command code to the ViewModel so that the ViewModel is actually reusable. We also noted that the Sculpture code-gen framework implements MVVM and a pattern similar to Prism AND it also makes extensive use of controllers to separate all use-case logic. Don't assume controllers are made obsolete by View-models. I have started a blog on this topic which I will add to as and when I can. There are issues with combining MVCVM with the common navigation systems, as most navigation systems just use Views and VMs, but I will go into that in later articles. An additional benefit of using an MVCVM model is that only the controller objects need to exist in memory for the life of the application and the controllers contain mainly code and little state data (i.e. tiny memory overhead). This makes for much less memory-intensive apps than solutions where view-models have to be retained and it is ideal for certain types of mobile development (e.g. Windows Mobile using Silverlight/Prism/MEF). This does of course depend on the type of application as you may still need to retain the occasional cached VMs for responsiveness. Note: This post has been edited numerous times, and did not specifically target the narrow question asked, so I have updated the first part to now cover that too. Much of the discussion, in comments below, relates only to ASP.Net and not the broader picture. This post was intended to cover the broader use of MVVM in Silverlight, WPF and ASP.Net and try avoid people replacing controllers with ViewModels.","MVC and MVVM are not mutually exclusive patterns. In ASP.Net, MVC is a server-side approach, while MVVM is used for client-side two-way data binding. In Silverlight and WPF, MVVM is a more comprehensive pattern that can replace MVC, but still requires controllers to handle logic and data flow. The ViewModel does not replace the need for controllers, which handle processing logic, data retrieval, and view logic. The basic guidelines for MVCVM are: 

- Views display data without knowing its source
- ViewModels hold data and commands, unaware of their source or display
- Models hold the actual data
- Controllers listen for events, provide logic, and control data flow
- Controllers provide commands to ViewModels for reusability.",,"MVC/MVVM is not an either/or choice. The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development.

3642919,javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException: View could not be restored,"Introduction The <code>ViewExpiredException</code> will be thrown whenever the <code>javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD</code> is set to <code>server</code> (default) and the enduser sends a HTTP POST request on a view via <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;h:commandLink&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h:commandButton&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;f:ajax&gt;</code>, while the associated view state isn't available in the session anymore. The view state is identified as value of a hidden input field <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> of the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code>. With the state saving method set to <code>server</code>, this contains only the view state ID which references a serialized view state in the session. So, when the session is expired for some reason (either timed out in server or client side, or the session cookie is not maintained anymore for some reason in browser, or by calling <code>HttpSession#invalidate()</code> in server, or due a server specific bug with session cookies as known in WildFly), then the serialized view state is not available anymore in the session and the enduser will get this exception. To understand the working of the session, see also How do servlets work? Instantiation, sessions, shared variables and multithreading. There is also a limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session. When the limit is hit, then the least recently used view will be expired. See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. With the state saving method set to <code>client</code>, the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden input field contains instead the whole serialized view state, so the enduser won't get a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when the session expires. It can however still happen on a cluster environment (""ERROR: MAC did not verify"" is symptomatic) and/or when there's a implementation-specific timeout on the client side state configured and/or when server re-generates the AES key during restart, see also Getting ViewExpiredException in clustered environment while state saving method is set to client and user session is valid how to solve it. Regardless of the solution, make sure you do not use <code>enableRestoreView11Compatibility</code>. it does not at all restore the original view state. It basically recreates the view and all associated view scoped beans from scratch and hereby thus losing all of original data (state). As the application will behave in a confusing way (""Hey, where are my input values..?? ""), this is very bad for user experience. Better use stateless views or <code>&lt;o:enableRestorableView&gt;</code> instead so you can manage it on a specific view only instead of on all views. As to the why JSF needs to save view state, head to this answer: Why JSF saves the state of UI components on server? Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page navigation In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when e.g. navigating back after logout when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, only redirecting the POST request after logout is not sufficient. You also need to instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, otherwise the browser may show them from the cache instead of requesting a fresh one from the server when you send a GET request on it (e.g. by back button). The <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field of the cached page may contain a view state ID value which is not valid anymore in the current session. If you're (ab)using POST (command links/buttons) instead of GET (regular links/buttons) for page-to-page navigation, and click such a command link/button on the cached page, then this will in turn fail with a <code>ViewExpiredException</code>. To fire a redirect after logout in JSF 2.0, either add <code>&lt;redirect /&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;navigation-case&gt;</code> in question (if any), or add <code>?faces-redirect=true</code> to the <code>outcome</code> value. or To instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, create a <code>Filter</code> which is mapped on the servlet name of the <code>FacesServlet</code> and adds the needed response headers to disable the browser cache. E.g. Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page refresh In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when refreshing the current page when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, you not only need to make sure you are performing page-to-page navigation exclusively by GET (regular links/buttons), but you also need to make sure that you are exclusively using ajax to submit the forms. If you're submitting the form synchronously (non-ajax) anyway, then you'd best either make the view stateless (see later section), or to send a redirect after POST (see previous section). Having a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> on page refresh is in default configuration a very rare case. It can only happen when the limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session is hit. So, it will only happen when you've manually set that limit way too low, or that you're continuously creating new views in background (e.g. by a badly implemented poll). See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. Another cause is having duplicate JSF libraries in runtime classpath conflicting each other. The correct procedure to install JSF is outlined in our JSF wiki page. Handling ViewExpiredException When you want to handle an unavoidable <code>ViewExpiredException</code> after a POST action on an arbitrary page which was already opened in some browser tab/window while you're logged out in another tab/window, then you'd like to specify an <code>error-page</code> for that in <code>web.xml</code> which goes to a ""Your session is timed out"" page. E.g. Use if necessary a meta refresh header in the error page in case you intend to actually redirect further to home or login page. (the <code>0</code> in <code>content</code> represents the amount of seconds before redirect, <code>0</code> thus means ""redirect immediately"", you can use e.g. <code>3</code> to let the browser wait 3 seconds with the redirect) Note that handling exceptions during ajax requests requires a special <code>ExceptionHandler</code>. See also Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request. You can find a live example at OmniFaces <code>FullAjaxExceptionHandler</code> showcase page (this also covers non-ajax requests). Also note that your ""general"" error page should be mapped on <code>&lt;error-code&gt;</code> of <code>500</code> instead of an <code>&lt;exception-type&gt;</code> of e.g. <code>java.lang.Exception</code> or <code>java.lang.Throwable</code>, otherwise all exceptions wrapped in <code>ServletException</code> such as <code>ViewExpiredException</code> would still end up in the general error page. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml. Stateless views A completely different alternative is to run JSF views in stateless mode. This way nothing of JSF state will be saved and the views will never expire, but just be rebuilt from scratch on every request. You can turn on stateless views by setting the <code>transient</code> attribute of <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>: This way the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field will get a fixed value of <code>""stateless""</code> in Mojarra (have not checked MyFaces at this point). Note that this feature was introduced in Mojarra 2.1.19 and 2.2.0 and is not available in older versions. The consequence is that you cannot use view scoped beans anymore. They will now behave like request scoped beans. One of the disadvantages is that you have to track the state yourself by fiddling with hidden inputs and/or loose request parameters. Mainly those forms with input fields with <code>rendered</code>, <code>readonly</code> or <code>disabled</code> attributes which are controlled by ajax events will be affected. Note that the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> does not necessarily need to be unique throughout the view and/or reside in the master template only.

In New Zealand: it's the previous day, February 28th for the purposes of driver licencing, and March 1st for other purposes. Taiwan: it's February 28th. And as near as I can tell, in the US, the statutes are silent on the matter, leaving it up to the common law and to how various regulatory bodies define things in their regulations.

667781,What is the difference between MVC and MVVM?,"MVVMC, or perhaps MVC+, seems to be a viable approach for enterprise as well as rapid application development. While it is nice to separate the UI from business and interaction logic, the 'pure' MVVM pattern and most available examples work best on singular views. Not sure about your designs, but most of my applications, however, contain pages and several (reusable) views and thus the ViewModels do need to interact to some degree. Using the page as controller would defeat the purpose of the MVVM altogether, so not using a ""VM-C"" approach for the underlying logic might result in .. well .. challenging constructs as the application matures. Even in VB-6 most of us probably stopped coding business logic into the Button event and started 'relaying' commands to a controller, right?

890128,Why are Python lambdas useful?,"As stated above, the lambda operator in Python defines an anonymous function, and in Python functions are closures. It is important not to confuse the concept of closures with the operator lambda, which is merely syntactic methadone for them. When I started in Python a few years ago, I used lambdas a lot, thinking they were cool, along with list comprehensions. However, I wrote and have to maintain a big website written in Python, with on the order of several thousand function points. I've learnt from experience that lambdas might be OK to prototype things with, but offer nothing over inline functions (named closures) except for saving a few key-stokes, or sometimes not. Basically this boils down to several points: it is easier to read software that is explicitly written using meaningful names. Anonymous closures by definition cannot have a meaningful name, as they have no name. This brevity seems, for some reason, to also infect lambda parameters, hence we often see examples like lambda x: x+1 it is easier to reuse named closures, as they can be referred to by name more than once, when there is a name to refer to them by. it is easier to debug code that is using named closures instead of lambdas, because the name will appear in tracebacks, and around the error. That's enough reason to round them up and convert them to named closures. However, I hold two other grudges against anonymous closures. The first grudge is simply that they are just another unnecessary keyword cluttering up the language. The second grudge is deeper and on the paradigm level, i.e. I do not like that they promote a functional-programming style, because that style is less flexible than the message passing, object oriented or procedural styles, because the lambda calculus is not Turing-complete (luckily in Python, we can still break out of that restriction even inside a lambda). The reasons I feel lambdas promote this style are: There is an implicit return, i.e. they seem like they 'should' be functions. They are an alternative state-hiding mechanism to another, more explicit, more readable, more reusable and more general mechanism: methods. I try hard to write lambda-free Python, and remove lambdas on sight. I think Python would be a slightly better language without lambdas, but that's just my opinion.","Python lambdas are not as useful as they seem, as they can make code harder to read, debug, and maintain. They promote a less flexible functional-programming style, are an alternative to more explicit methods, and add unnecessary language clutter.",,"I've learnt from experience that lambdas might be OK to prototype things with, but offer nothing over inline functions (named closures) except for saving a few key-stokes, or sometimes not."
1074081,Hibernate Error: org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException: a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session,"This is only one point where hibernate makes more problems than it solves. In my case there are many objects with the same identifier 0, because they are new and don't have one. The db generates them. Somewhere I have read that 0 signals Id not set. The intuitive way to persist them is iterating over them and saying hibernate to save the objects. But You can't do that - ""Of course You should know that hibernate works this and that way, therefore You have to.."" So now I can try to change Ids to Long instead of long and look if it then works. In the end it's easier to do it with a simple mapper by your own, because hibernate is just an additional intransparent burden. Another example: Trying to read parameters from one database and persist them in another forces you to do nearly all work manually.

4062001,CSS3 Border Opacity?,"Unfortunately the <code>opacity</code> element makes the whole element (including any text) semi-transparent. The best way to make the border semi-transparent is with the rgba color format. For example, this would give a red border with 50% opacity: The problem with this approach is that some browsers do not understand the <code>rgba</code> format and will not display any border at all if this is the entire declaration. The solution is to provide two border declarations. The first with a fake opacity, and the second with the actual. If a browser is capable, it will use the second, if not, it will use the first. The first border declaration will be the equivalent color to a 50% opaque red border over a white background (although any graphics under the border will not bleed through). UPDATE: I've added ""background-clip: padding-box;"" to this answer (per  SooDesuNe's suggestion in the comments) to ensure the border remains transparent even if a solid background color is applied.","Use the rgba color format to set a semi-transparent border in CSS3, and provide two declarations to support browsers that don't understand rgba.",,The best way to make the border semi-transparent is with the rgba color format.

It was baffling! Turns out, I let a variable go out of scope and the garbage collector swept it away and then I tried to use it. Thus the seemingly-random timing. To give a more concrete example... Inside a method, I had something like: Now in my JSP page, I called that method and used the List object returned by it. The List object is backed by that ""foos"" array; but, the array went out of scope when I returned from the method (since it is a local variable). So shortly after returning, the garbage collector swept away the ""foos"" array, and my access to the List caused a NullPointerException since its underlying array was now wiped away. I actually wondered, as I wrote the above method, whether that would happen. The even deeper underlying problem was premature optimization. I wanted a list, but I knew I would have exactly 20 elements, so I figured I'd try to be more efficient than <code>new ArrayList&lt;Foo&gt;(20)</code> which only sets an initial size of 20 but can possibly be less efficient than the method I used.

529085,How to create a generic array in Java?,"Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): That compiles without warnings, and as you can see in <code>main</code>, for whatever type you declare an instance of <code>GenSet</code> as, you can assign <code>a</code> to an array of that type, and you can assign an element from <code>a</code> to a variable of that type, meaning that the array and the values in the array are of the correct type. It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials. Class literals are treated by the compiler as instances of <code>java.lang.Class</code>. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with <code>.class</code>. So, <code>String.class</code> acts as a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>. This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. <code>String[].class</code>), primitives (e.g. <code>int.class</code>), and the keyword <code>void</code> (i.e. <code>void.class</code>). <code>Class</code> itself is generic (declared as <code>Class&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> stands for the type that the <code>Class</code> object is representing), meaning that the type of <code>String.class</code> is <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>. So, whenever you call the constructor for <code>GenSet</code>, you pass in a class literal for the first argument representing an array of the <code>GenSet</code> instance's declared type (e.g. <code>String[].class</code> for <code>GenSet&lt;String&gt;</code>). Note that you won't be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can't be used for type variables. Inside the constructor, calling the method <code>cast</code> returns the passed <code>Object</code> argument cast to the class represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called. Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument. Calling the method <code>getComponentType</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the component type of the array represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called (e.g. <code>String.class</code> for <code>String[].class</code>, <code>null</code> if the <code>Class</code> object doesn't represent an array). That last sentence isn't entirely accurate. Calling <code>String[].class.getComponentType()</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>, but its type is <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, not <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>, which is why you can't do something like the following. Same goes for every method in <code>Class</code> that returns a <code>Class</code> object. Regarding Joachim Sauer's comment on this answer (I don't have enough reputation to comment on it myself), the example using the cast to <code>T[]</code> will result in a warning because the compiler can't guarantee type safety in that case. Edit regarding Ingo's comments:","A generic array can be created in Java using a class that takes a class literal as a type parameter, and uses reflection to create an array of the specified type.",Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument.,"Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials.

4358728,End of File (EOF) in C,"EOF indicates ""end of file"". A newline (which is what happens when you press enter) isn't the end of a <em>file</em>, it's the end of a <em>line</em>, so a newline doesn't terminate this loop. The code isn't wrong[*], it just doesn't do what you seem to expect. It reads to the end of the input, but you seem to want to read only to the end of a line. The value of EOF is -1 because it has to be different from any return value from <code>getchar</code> that is an actual character. So <code>getchar</code> returns any character value as an unsigned char, converted to int, which will therefore be non-negative. If you're typing at the terminal and you want to provoke an end-of-file, use CTRL-D (unix-style systems) or CTRL-Z (Windows). Then after all the input has been read, <code>getchar()</code> will return <code>EOF</code>, and hence <code>getchar() != EOF</code> will be false, and the loop will terminate. [*] well, it has undefined behavior if the input is more than LONG_MAX characters due to integer overflow, but we can probably forgive that in a simple example.","EOF (End of File) indicates the end of a file, not the end of a line.

4358728,End of File (EOF) in C,"EOF is -1 because that's how it's defined. The name is provided by the standard library headers that you <code>#include</code>. They make it equal to -1 because it has to be something that can't be mistaken for an actual byte read by <code>getchar()</code>. <code>getchar()</code> reports the values of actual bytes using positive number (0 up to 255 inclusive), so -1 works fine for this. The <code>!=</code> operator means ""not equal"". 0 stands for false, and anything else stands for true. So what happens is, we call the <code>getchar()</code> function, and compare the result to -1 (EOF). If the result was not equal to EOF, then the result is true, because things that are not equal are not equal. If the result was equal to EOF, then the result is false, because things that are equal are not (not equal). The call to <code>getchar()</code> returns EOF when you reach the ""end of file"". As far as C is concerned, the 'standard input' (the data you are giving to your program by typing in the command window) is just like a file. Of course, you can always type more, so you need an explicit way to say ""I'm done"". On Windows systems, this is control-Z. On Unix systems, this is control-D. The example in the book is not ""wrong"". It depends on <strong>what you actually want to do</strong>. Reading until EOF means that you read everything, until the user says ""I'm done"", and then you can't read any more. Reading until '\n' means that you read a line of input.

4370960,What is attr_accessor in Ruby?,"attr_accessor is just a method. (The link should provide more insight with how it works - look at the pairs of methods generated, and a tutorial should show you how to use it.) The trick is that <code>class</code> is not a definition in Ruby (it is ""just a definition"" in languages like C++ and Java), but it is an expression that evaluates. It is during this evaluation when the <code>attr_accessor</code> method is invoked which in turn modifies the current class - remember the implicit receiver: <code>self.attr_accessor</code>, where <code>self</code> is the ""open"" class object at this point. The need for <code>attr_accessor</code> and friends, is, well: Ruby, like Smalltalk, does not allow instance variables to be accessed outside of methods1 for that object. That is, instance variables cannot be accessed in the <code>x.y</code> form as is common in say, Java or even Python. In Ruby <code>y</code> is always taken as a message to send (or ""method to call""). Thus the <code>attr_*</code> methods create wrappers which proxy the instance <code>@variable</code> access through dynamically created methods. Boilerplate sucks Hope this clarifies some of the little details. Happy coding. 1 This isn't strictly true and there are some ""techniques"" around this, but there is no syntax support for ""public instance variable"" access.","`attr_accessor` is a Ruby method that generates getter and setter methods for instance variables, allowing them to be accessed directly, while providing a way to dynamically create methods for accessing these variables.",,attr_accessor is just a method.

","Android has several units for measuring screen size: px (pixels), in (inches), mm (millimeters), pt (points), dp (density-independent pixels), and sp (scale-independent pixels). 

- px corresponds to actual pixels on the screen.
- in and mm are based on physical screen size.
- pt is 1/72 of an inch based on physical screen size.
- dp is density-independent pixels, an abstract unit relative to a 160 dpi screen.
- sp is scale-independent pixels, similar to dp but also scaled by the user's font size preference.",,"<strong>px</strong>
<strong>Pixels</strong> - corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. <strong>in</strong>
<strong>Inches</strong> - based on the physical size of the screen. <strong>mm</strong>
&gt; <strong>Millimeters</strong> - based on the physical size of the screen. <strong>dp</strong> or <strong>dip</strong>
&gt; <strong>Density</strong>-independent Pixels - an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a <code>160</code>
dpi screen, so one dp is one pixel on a <code>160</code> dpi screen. <strong>sp</strong>
&gt; Scaleable Pixels <strong>OR</strong> scale-independent pixels - this is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended you
use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted
for both the screen density and the user's preference. From Understanding Density Independence In Android:

417142,What is the maximum length of a URL in different browsers?,"<h2>Short answer - de facto limit of 2000 characters</h2>
<p>If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software, and any search engine.</p>
<p>For specific use cases, longer URLs can be considered. Outside of search engines, 8000 characters offers wide compatibility as of 2023. Read on for all the details...</p>
<h2>Longer answer - first, the standards...</h2>
<p>The original HTTP/1.1 specification, published in 1999, <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 2616</a>, said in section 3.2.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP protocol does not place
any a priori limit on the length of
a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
the URI of any resource they    serve,
and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
unbounded length if they    provide
GET-based forms that could generate
such URIs. A server    SHOULD return
414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
URI is longer    than the server can
handle (see section 10.4.15).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, this was obsoleted by an updated specification largely to match actual usage, <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.1.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 7230</a>; it suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in
practice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients
support, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2022, a new update was published, defining HTTP semantics independently of HTTP version (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3). <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.1-5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 9110, section 4.1</a>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that all senders and recipients support, at a minimum, URIs with lengths of 8000 octets in protocol elements. Note that this implies some structures and on-wire representations (for example, the request line in HTTP/1.1) will necessarily be larger in some cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>...and the reality</h2>
<p>That's what the <em>standards</em> say. For the <em>reality</em>, there was an article on <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190902193246/https://boutell.com/newfaq/misc/urllength.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">boutell.com</a> (link goes to Internet Archive backup) that discussed what individual browser and server implementations will support. The executive summary is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: this is a quote from an article written in <em>2006</em>, but in 2015 IE's declining usage means that longer URLs <em>do</em> work for the majority. However, IE still has the limitation...)</p>

<p>I've tested IE10 and the address bar will only accept 2083 chars. You can <em>click</em> a URL which is longer than this, but the address bar will still only show 2083 characters of this link.</p>
<p>There's a <a href=""https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2014/08/13/url-length-limits/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nice writeup on the IE Internals blog</a> which goes into some of the background to this.</p>
<p>There are mixed reports IE11 supports longer URLs - see comments below. Given some people report issues, the general advice still stands.</p>
<h2>Search engines like URLs &lt; 2048 chars...</h2>
<p>Be aware that the <a href=""http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sitemaps protocol</a>, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL.

292357,What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?,"<p>It is important to contrast the design philosophy of git with the philosophy of a more traditional source control tool like SVN.</p>

<p>Subversion was designed and built with a client/server model. There is a single repository that is the server, and several clients can fetch code from the server, work on it, then commit it back to the server. The assumption is that the client can always contact the server when it needs to perform an operation.</p>

<p>Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the ""server"" don't need to be online at the same time. Git was designed so that people on an unreliable link could exchange code via email, even. It is possible to work completely disconnected and burn a CD to exchange code via git.</p>

<p>In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. By keeping a copy of the remote repository locally, git can figure out the changes needed even when the remote repository is not reachable.  Later when you need to send the changes to someone else, git can transfer them as a set of changes from a point in time known to the remote repository.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> is the command that says ""bring my local copy of the remote repository up to date."" </p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>git pull</code></strong> says ""bring the changes in the remote repository to where I keep my own code.""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Normally <strong><code>git pull</code></strong> does this by doing a <strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.</p>

<p>The take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least <strong>three copies</strong> of a project on your workstation. One copy is your own repository with your own commit history. The second copy is your working copy where you are editing and building. The third copy is your local ""cached"" copy of a remote repository.</p>

extra-extra-extra-high.</p>
<p><strong>Orientation</strong><br/>The orientation of the screen from the user's point of
view. This is either landscape or portrait, meaning that the screen's
aspect ratio is either wide or tall, respectively. Be aware that not
only do different devices operate in different orientations by
default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user
rotates the device.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong><br/> The total number of physical pixels on
a screen. When adding support for multiple screens, applications do
not work directly with resolution; applications should be concerned
only with screen size and density, as specified by the generalized
size and density groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Density-independent pixel (dp)</strong><br/> A virtual
pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express
layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way.
The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160
dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a
&quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles
any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density
of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:
<code>px = dp * (dpi / 160)</code>.
For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp
equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when
defining your application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on
screens with different densities.</p>

<h2>Where should I use <code>'use strict';</code>?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In my <em>new</em> JavaScript application: <strong>Absolutely!</strong> Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In my <em>existing</em> JavaScript code: <strong>Probably not!</strong> If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break.

</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>How do I use strict mode?</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Insert a <code>'use strict';</code> statement on top of your script:</p>
<pre><code> // File: myscript.js

 'use strict';
 var a = 2;
 ....
</code></pre>
<p>Note that everything in the file <code>myscript.js</code> will be interpreted in strict mode.</p>

<li><p>Or, insert a <code>'use strict';</code> statement on top of your function body:</p>

<p>Everything in the <em>lexical scope</em> of function <code>doSomething</code> will be interpreted in strict mode. The word <em>lexical scope</em> is important here.

<h2>What things are prohibited in strict mode?</h2>
<p>I found a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20200704094929/http://yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/"" rel=""noreferrer"">nice article</a> describing several things that are prohibited in strict mode (note that this is not an exhaustive list):</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Historically, JavaScript has been confused about how functions
are scoped. Sometimes they seem to be statically scoped, but some
features make them behave like they are dynamically scoped. This is
confusing, making programs difficult to read and understand.
Misunderstanding causes bugs. It also is a problem for performance.
Static scoping would permit variable binding to happen at compile
time, but the requirement for dynamic scope means the binding must be
deferred to runtime, which comes with a significant performance
penalty.</p>
<p>Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically.
That means that the features that previously required dynamic binding
must be eliminated or modified. Specifically, the with statement is
eliminated, and the eval function’s ability to tamper with the
environment of its caller is severely restricted.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of strict code is that tools like <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/"" rel=""noreferrer"">YUI Compressor</a>
can do a better job when processing it.</p>
<h2>Implied Global Variables</h2>
<p>JavaScript has implied global variables. If
you do not explicitly declare a variable, a global variable is
implicitly declared for you. This makes programming easier for
beginners because they can neglect some of their basic housekeeping
chores. But it makes the management of larger programs much more
difficult and it significantly degrades reliability. So in strict
mode, implied global variables are no longer created. You should
explicitly declare all of your variables.</p>
<h2>Global Leakage</h2>
<p>There are a number of situations that could cause <code>this</code>
to be bound to the global object. For example, if you forget to
provide the <code>new</code> prefix when calling a constructor function, the
constructor's <code>this</code> will be bound unexpectedly to the global object, so
instead of initializing a new object, it will instead be silently
tampering with global variables. In these situations, strict mode will
instead bind <code>this</code> to <code>undefined</code>, which will cause the constructor to
throw an exception instead, allowing the error to be detected much
sooner.</p>
<h2>Noisy Failure</h2>
<p>JavaScript has always had read-only properties, but you
could not create them yourself until ES5’s <code>Object.createProperty</code>
function exposed that capability. If you attempted to assign a value
to a read-only property, it would fail silently. The assignment would
not change the property’s value, but your program would proceed as
though it had. This is an integrity hazard that can cause programs to
go into an inconsistent state. In strict mode, attempting to change a
read-only property will throw an exception.</p>
<h2>Octal</h2>
<p>The octal (or base 8) representation of numbers was extremely
useful when doing machine-level programming on machines whose word
sizes were a multiple of 3. You needed octal when working with the CDC
6600 mainframe, which had a word size of 60 bits. If you could read
octal, you could look at a word as 20 digits. Two digits represented
the op code, and one digit identified one of 8 registers. During the
slow transition from machine codes to high level languages, it was
thought to be useful to provide octal forms in programming languages.</p>
<p>In C, an extremely unfortunate representation of octalness was
selected: Leading zero. So in C, <code>0100</code> means 64, not 100, and <code>08</code> is an
error, not 8. Even more unfortunately, this anachronism has been
copied into nearly all modern languages, including JavaScript, where
it is only used to create errors. It has no other purpose. So in
strict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed.</p>
<h2>Et cetera</h2>
<p>The arguments pseudo array becomes a little bit more
array-like in ES5. In strict mode, it loses its <code>callee</code> and <code>caller</code>
properties. This makes it possible to pass your <code>arguments</code> to untrusted
code without giving up a lot of confidential context. Also, the
<code>arguments</code> property of functions is eliminated.</p>
<p>In strict mode, duplicate keys in a function literal will produce a
syntax error. A function can’t have two parameters with the same name.
A function can’t have a variable with the same name as one of its
parameters. A function can’t <code>delete</code> its own variables. An attempt to
<code>delete</code> a non-configurable property now throws an exception. Primitive
values are not implicitly wrapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Reserved words for future JavaScript versions</h2>
<p>ECMAScript 5 adds a list of reserved words. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error. The reserved words are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>implements</code>, <code>interface</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>package</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>yield</code></p>

baseline density assumed by the system for a &quot;medium&quot; density screen.
At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp
units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use.
The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi
/ 160). For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical
pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your
application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on screens with

","Android screen measurements have four key concepts: screen size, screen density, orientation, and resolution. The density-independent pixel (dp) is a virtual unit used for UI layout, equivalent to 1 physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, and is scaled by the system based on the actual screen density.",,"Moreover you should have a clear understanding of the following concepts:</strong>
<strong> For simplicity, Android groups all actual screen sizes into
four generalized sizes: Screen density:</strong> For simplicity,
Android groups all actual screen densities into four generalized
densities: low, medium, high, and extra high. <strong>Orientation:</strong> Be aware
that not only do different devices operate in different orientations
by default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user
rotates the device. When adding support for multiple screens, applications do not work directly
with resolution; applications should be concerned only with screen
size and density, as specified by the generalized size and density
groups. <strong>Density-independent pixel (dp):</strong>

A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or
position in a density-independent way. You should always use dp units when defining your
application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on screens with
different densities."

git-pull - Fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch
SYNOPSIS

git pull   …
DESCRIPTION

Runs git-fetch with the given parameters, and calls git-merge to merge the 
retrieved head(s) into the current branch. With --rebase, calls git-rebase 
instead of git-merge.

Note that you can use . (current directory) as the &lt;repository> to pull 
from the local repository — this is useful when merging local branches 
into the current branch.

Also note that options meant for git-pull itself and underlying git-merge 
must be given before the options meant for git-fetch.

also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that
you are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using
the --tags or --no-tags options or by configuring

you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested

<blockquote>
<p>These are dimension values defined in XML. A dimension is specified
with a number followed by a unit of measure. For example: 10px, 2in,
5sp. The following units of measure are supported by Android:</p>
<p><strong>dp</strong></p>
<p>Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the
physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a 160 dpi
(dots per inch) screen, on which 1dp is roughly equal to 1px. When
running on a higher density screen, the number of pixels used to draw
1dp is scaled up by a factor appropriate for the screen's dpi.
Likewise, when on a lower density screen, the number of pixels used
for 1dp is scaled down. The ratio of dp-to-pixel will change with the
screen density, but not necessarily in direct proportion. Using dp
units (instead of px units) is a simple solution to making the view
dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen
densities. In other words, it provides consistency for the real-world
sizes of your UI elements across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>sp</strong></p>
<p>Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended that you use
this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for
both the screen density and the user's preference.</p>
<p><strong>pt</strong></p>
<p>Points - 1/72 of an inch based on the physical size of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>px</strong></p>
<p>Pixels - Corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. This unit of
measure is not recommended because the actual representation can vary
across devices; each device may have a different number of pixels per
inch and may have more or fewer total pixels available on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>mm</strong></p>
<p>Millimeters - Based on the physical size of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>in</strong></p>
<p>Inches - Based on the physical size of the screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A dimension is a simple resource that is referenced using the value provided in the name attribute (not the name of the XML file). As such, you can combine dimension resources with other simple resources in one XML file, under one  element.</p>
","Android has four units for specifying dimensions in XML: 

- `px`: actual pixels on the screen
- `dp` (Density-independent Pixels): relative to a 160 dpi screen, scales with screen density
- `sp` (Scale-independent Pixels): like dp, but also scales with user's font size preference
- `in` and `mm`: based on the physical size of the screen.",,"These are dimension values defined in XML. A dimension is specified
with a number followed by a unit of measure. The following units of measure are supported by Android:
<strong>dp</strong>
Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the
physical density of the screen. Using dp
units (instead of px units) is a simple solution to making the view
dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen
densities. In other words, it provides consistency for the real-world
sizes of your UI elements across different devices. <strong>sp</strong>
Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended that you use
this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for
both the screen density and the user's preference. This unit of
measure is not recommended because the actual representation can vary
across devices; each device may have a different number of pixels per
inch and may have more or fewer total pixels available on the screen. A dimension is a simple resource that is referenced using the value provided in the name attribute (not the name of the XML file)."

292357,What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?,"<p>The Difference between <strong>GIT Fetch</strong> and <strong>GIT Pull</strong> can be explained with the following scenario:
<em>(Keeping in mind that pictures speak louder than words!, I have provided pictorial representation)</em></p>
<p>Let's take an example that you are working on a project with your team members. So there will be one main Branch of the project and all the contributors must fork it to their own local repository and then work on this local branch to modify/Add modules then push back to the main branch.</p>
<p>So,
<strong>Initial State</strong> of the two Branches when you forked the main project on your local repository will be like this- (<code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are Modules already completed of the project)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/SPky3.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SPky3.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you have started working on the new module (suppose <code>D</code>)  and when you have completed the <code>D</code> module you want to push it to the main branch, But meanwhile what happens is that one of your teammates has developed new Module <code>E</code>, <code>F</code> and modified <code>C</code>.<br>
So now what has happened is that your local repository is lacking behind the original progress of the project and thus pushing of your changes to the main branch can lead to conflict and may cause your Module <code>D</code> to malfunction.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/SpIlX.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SpIlX.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>To avoid such issues and to work parallel with the original progress of the project there are Two ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Git Fetch-</strong> This will Download all the changes that have been made to the origin/main branch project which are not present in your local branch. And will wait for the Git Merge command to apply the changes that have been fetched to your Repository or branch.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/8qhgH.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/8qhgH.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>So now You can carefully monitor the files before merging it to your repository. And you can also modify <code>D</code> if required because of Modified <code>C</code>.</p>

<p><strong>2. Git Pull-</strong> This will update your local branch with the origin/main branch i.e. actually what it does is a combination of Git Fetch and Git merge one after another.

292357,What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?,"<p>In simple terms, if you were about to hop onto a plane without any Internet connection… before departing you could just do <code>git fetch origin &lt;branch&gt;</code>. It would fetch all the changes into your computer, but keep it separate from your local development/workspace.</p>
<p>On the plane, you could make changes to your local workspace and then merge it with what you've previously fetched and then resolve potential merge conflicts all without a connection to the Internet. And unless someone had made <em>new</em> changes to the remote repository then, upon arrive at the destination you would do <code>git push origin &lt;branch&gt;</code> and go get your coffee.</p>
<hr />
<p>From this awesome <a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-fetch"" rel=""noreferrer"">Atlassian tutorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>git fetch</code> command downloads commits, files, and refs from a
remote repository into your local repository.</p>
<p>Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody <em>else</em> has
been working on. It’s similar to SVN update in that it lets you see
how the central history has progressed, but it doesn’t force you to
actually merge the changes into your repository. Git <strong>isolates
fetched content as a from existing local content</strong>, it has absolutely
<strong>no effect on your local development work</strong>. Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the <code>git checkout</code> command. This makes
fetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with
your local repository.</p>
<p>When downloading content from a remote repository, <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code> commands are available to accomplish the task. You can consider
<code>git fetch</code> the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download
the remote content, but not update your local repository's working state,
leaving your current work intact. <code>git pull</code> is the more aggressive
alternative, it will download the remote content for the active local
branch and immediately execute <code>git merge</code> to create a merge commit
for the new remote content. If you have pending changes in progress
this will cause conflicts and kickoff the merge conflict resolution
flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>With <code>git pull</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't get any isolation.</li>
<li>It doesn't need to be explicitly checked out. Because it implicitly does a <code>git merge</code>.</li>
<li>The merging step will affect your local development and <em>may</em> cause conflicts</li>
<li>It's basically NOT safe. It's aggressive.</li>
<li>Unlike <code>git fetch</code> where it only affects your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code>, git pull will affect both your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>.git/refs/heads/</code></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Hmmm...so if I'm not updating the working copy with <code>git fetch</code>, then where am I making changes? Where does Git fetch store the new commits?</strong></p>
<p>Great question. First and foremost, the <code>heads</code> or <code>remotes</code> don't store the new commits. They just have <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3965676/why-did-my-git-repo-enter-a-detached-head-state/65847406#65847406"">pointers</a> to commits. So with <code>git fetch</code> you download the latest <a href=""https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/git_object_types.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">git objects</a> (blob, tree, commits. To fully understand the objects watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG90LZotrpo"" rel=""noreferrer"">this video on git internals</a>), but only update your <code>remotes</code> pointer to point to the latest commit of that branch.  It's still isolated from your working copy, because your branch's pointer in the <code>heads</code> directory hasn't updated. It will only update upon a <code>merge</code>/<code>pull</code>. But again where? Let's find out.</p>
<p>In your project directory (i.e., where you do your <code>git</code> commands) do:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>ls</code>. This will show the files &amp; directories. Nothing cool, I know.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now do <code>ls -a</code>. This will show <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/21778/whats-so-special-about-directories-whose-names-begin-with-a-dot"">dot files</a>, i.e., files beginning with <code>.</code> You will then be able to see a directory named: <code>.git</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do <code>cd .git</code>. This will obviously change your directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now comes the fun part; do <code>ls</code>. You will see a list of directories. We're looking for <code>refs</code>. Do <code>cd refs</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's interesting to see what's inside all directories, but let's focus on two of them. <code>heads</code> and <code>remotes</code>. Use <code>cd</code> to check inside them too.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Any</em> <code>git fetch</code> that you do will update the pointer in the <code>/.git/refs/remotes</code> directory. It <strong>won't</strong> update anything in the <code>/.git/refs/heads</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Any</em> <code>git pull</code> will first do the <code>git fetch</code> and update items in the <code>/.git/refs/remotes</code> directory.  It will then <strong>also</strong> merge with your local and then change the head inside the <code>/.git/refs/heads</code> directory.</p>

<h2>To see the actual difference</h2>
<p>Just do:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin master
git checkout master
</code></pre>
<p>If the remote master was updated you'll get a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to update your local branch)
</code></pre>
<p>If you didn't <code>fetch</code> and just did <code>git checkout master</code> then your local git wouldn't know that there are 2 commits added. And it would just say:</p>
<pre><code>Already on 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
</code></pre>
<p>But that's outdated and incorrect. It's because git will give you feedback solely based on what it knows. It's oblivious to new commits that it hasn't pulled down yet...</p>
<hr />
<h2>Is there any way to see the new changes made in remote while working on the branch locally?</h2>
<p>Some IDEs (e.g. Xcode) are super smart and use the result of a <code>git fetch</code> and can annotate the lines of code that have been changed in remote branch of your current working branch. If that line has been changed by both local changes and remote branch, then that line gets annotated with red. This isn't a merge conflict. It's a <em>potential</em> merge conflict. It's a headsup that you can use to resolve the future merge conflict before doing <code>git pull</code> from the remote branch.</p>

1335851,"What does ""use strict"" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?","<p>I would like to offer a somewhat more founded answer complementing the other answers. I was hoping to edit the most popular answer, but failed. I tried to make it as comprehensive and complete as I could.</p>
<p>You can refer to the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p><code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code> a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5.</p>
<p>Directives are similar to statements, yet different.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>use strict</code> does not contain key words: The directive is a simple expression statement, which consists of a special string literal (in single or double quotes). JavaScript engines, that do not implement ECMAScript 5, merely see an expression statement without side effects. It is expected that future versions of ECMAScript standards introduce <code>use</code> as a real key word; the quotes would thereby become obsolete.</li>
<li><code>use strict</code> can be used only at the beginning of a script or of a function, i.e. it must precede every other (real) statement. It does not have to be the first instruction in a script of function: it can be preceded by other statement expressions that consist of string literals ( and JavaScript implementations can treat them as implementation specific directives). String literals statements, which follow a first real statement (in a script or function) are simple expression statements. Interpreters must not interpret them as directives and they have no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>use strict</code> directive indicates that the following code (in a script or a function) is strict code.
The code in the highest level of a script (code that is not in a function) is considered strict code when the script contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
The content of a function is considered strict code when the function itself is defined in a strict code or when the function contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
Code that is passed to an <code>eval()</code> method is considered strict code when <code>eval()</code> was called from a strict code or contains the <code>use strict</code> directive itself.</p>
<p>The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important):</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode.</li>
<li>In strict mode all variables have to be declared: if you assign a value to an identifier that has not been declared as variable, function, function parameter, catch-clause parameter or property of the global <code>Object</code>, then you will get a <code>ReferenceError</code>. In normal mode the identifier is implicitly declared as a global variable (as a property of the global <code>Object</code>)</li>
<li>In strict mode the keyword <code>this</code> has the value <code>undefined</code> in functions that were invoked as functions (not as methods). (In normal mode <code>this</code> always points to the global <code>Object</code>). This difference can be used to test if an implementation supports the strict mode:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>var hasStrictMode = (function() { &quot;use strict&quot;; return this===undefined }());
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Also when a function is invoked with <code>call()</code> or <code>apply</code> in strict mode, then <code>this</code> is exactly the value of the first argument of the <code>call()</code>or <code>apply()</code> invocation. (In normal mode <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are replaced by the global <code>Object</code> and values, which are not objects, are cast into objects.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>TypeError</code>, when you try to assign to readonly properties or to define new properties for a non extensible object. (In normal mode both simply fail without error message.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode, when passing code to <code>eval()</code>, you cannot declare or define variables or functions in the scope of the caller (as you can do it in normal mode). Instead, a new scope is created for <code>eval()</code> and the variables and functions are within that scope. That scope is destroyed after <code>eval()</code> finishes execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode the arguments-object of a function contains a static copy of the values, which are passed to that function. In normal mode the arguments-object has a somewhat &quot;magical&quot; behaviour: The elements of the array and the named function parameters reference both the same value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>SyntaxError</code> when the <code>delete</code> operator is followed by a non qualified identifier (a variable, function or function parameter). In normal mode the <code>delete</code> expression would do nothing and is evaluated to <code>false</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>TypeError</code> when you try to delete a non configurable property. (In normal mode the attempt simply fails and the <code>delete</code> expression is evaluated to <code>false</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when you try to define several properties with the same name for an object literal. (In normal mode there is no error.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when a function declaration has multiple parameters with the same name. (In normal mode there is no error.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode octal literals are not allowed (these are literals that start with <code>0</code>. (In normal mode some implementations do allow octal literals.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode the identifiers <code>eval</code> and <code>arguments</code> are treated like keywords. You cannot change their value, cannot assign a value to them, and you cannot use them as names for variables, functions, function parameters or identifiers of a catch block.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode are more restrictions on the possibilities to examine the call stack. <code>arguments.caller</code> and <code>arguments.callee</code> cause a <code>TypeError</code> in a function in strict mode. Furthermore, some caller- and arguments properties of functions in strict mode cause a <code>TypeError</code> when you try to read them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
","The ""use strict"" directive in JavaScript is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 5 that enables strict mode, which eliminates language deficits, improves error checking, and enhances security. It can be used at the beginning of a script or function and has the following effects:

- Requires variable declaration
- Changes the behavior of `this` in functions

<h3>Density-independent pixel (dp)</h3>
<p>A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. As described above, the density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a &quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:</p>
<p>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</p>
<p>For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure
proper display of your UI on screens with different densities.</p>
<p>Understanding pixel to dp and vice versa is very essential (especially for giving exact dp values to creative team)</p>
<pre><code>dp = px * 160 / dpi

MDPI = 160 dpi || Therefore, on MDPI 1 px = 1 dp
For example, if you want to convert 20 pixel to dp, use the above formula,
dp = 20 * 160 / 160 = 20.
So, 20 pixel = 20 dp.

HDPI = 240 dpi - So, on HDPI 1.5 px = 1 dp
XHDPI = 320 dpi - So, on XHDPI 2 px = 1 dp
XXHDPI = 480 dpi - So, on XXHDPI 3 px = 1 dp

For example, let us consider Nexus 4.
If 24 pixels to be converted to dp and if it is a Nexus 4 screen, developers can
convert it to dp easily by the following calculation :
dp = 24 * 160 / 320 = 12 dp
Screen dimension:
768 x 1280 pixel resolution (320 ppi or 320dpi)
Optional (screen size):
 4.7&quot; diagonal
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Try to get all pixel values in even numbers from the creative team. Otherwise precision lose will happen while multiplying with 0.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>px</h3>
<p>It is explained above. Try to avoid in layout files. But there are some cases, where px is required. for example, ListView divider line. px is better here for giving a one-pixel line as a divider for all across screen resolutions.</p>
<h3>sp</h3>
<p>Use sp for font sizes. Then only the font inside the application will change while device fonts size changes (that is, Display -&gt; Fonts on Device). If you want to keep a static sized font inside the app, you can give the font dimension in dp. In such a case, it will never change. Developers may get such a requirement for some specific screens, for that, developers can use dp instead of sp. In all other cases, sp is recommended.</p>
","There are three types of units in Android:

1. **px (Pixels)**: Used for defining exact screen positions and sizes, but not recommended for layout dimensions. 
2. **dp (Density-independent pixels)**: A virtual pixel unit for expressing layout dimensions or positions in a density-independent way. It's equivalent to 1 physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen and is automatically scaled based on the screen's actual density.
3. **sp (Scaled pixels)**: Used for font sizes, allowing the font to change with the device's font size setting.",,"A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way.

Below mentioned is some information to be considered in addition to the above answers. Most Android developers miss this while developing apps, so I am adding these points.</p>
<p>sp = scale independent pixel</p>
<p>dp = density independent pixels</p>
<p>dpi = density pixels</p>
<p>I have gone through the above answers...not finding them exactly correct.
sp for text size, dp for layout bounds - standard.
But <strong>sp for text size will break the layout if used carelessly</strong> in most of the devices.</p>
<p>sp take the text size of the device, whereas dp take that of device density standard( never change in a device)
Say 100sp text can occupy 80% of the screen or 100% of the screen depending on the font size set in the device</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/9syOs.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/9syOs.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>You can use sp for layout bounds also, it will work :)
<strong>No standard app use sp for whole text</strong></p>
<p>Use sp and dp for text size considering UX.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use sp for text in the toolbar( can use android dimens available for different screen sizes with dp)</li>
<li>Don't use sp for text in small bounded buttons, very smaller text, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people use huge FONT size in their phone for more readability, giving them small hardcoded sized text will be a UX issue. Put sp for text where necessary, but make sure it won't break the layout when the user changes his settings.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have a single app supporting all dimensions, adding xxxhdpi assets increases the app size a lot. But now xxxhdpi phones are common so we have to include xxxhdpi assets at least for icons in the sidebar, toolbar, and bottom bar. It's better to move to vector images to have a uniform and better quality images for all screen sizes.</p>
<p>Also, note that people use custom fonts on their phones. So lack of a font can cause problems regarding spacing and all. Say text size 12sp for a custom font may take some pixels extra than the default font.</p>

","Android uses screen size, density, and resolution categories. 

*   Screen size categories: small, medium, large, extra large, double-extra, and triple-extra.
*   Screen density categories: low, medium, high, and extra high.
*   Resolution: total number of pixels on the screen.

Key units:

*   **dp** (Density Independent Pixel): varies based on screen density, 1 dp = 1 pixel in 160 dpi screen. Use dp for all layouts except font sizes.
*   **dip**: same as dp, used in earlier Android versions, now replaced by dp.
*   **sp** (Scale Independent Pixel): scaled based on user's font size preference, use sp for font sizes.
*   **px** (pixel): standard pixel, maps to the screen pixel.
*   **in** (inches): physical screen size.
*   **mm** (millimeters): physical screen size.
*   **pt** (points): 1/72 of an inch, physical screen size.

Conversion formula: px = dp * (dpi / 160)

Example: A 150px X 150px image occupies 150 dp X 150 dp screen space in mdpi, 100 dp X 100",,"Screen Size</strong> in <code>Android</code> is grouped into categories <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>, <code>large</code>, <code>extra large</code>, <code>double-extra</code> and <code>triple-extra</code>. Screen density is the number of pixels within an area (like an inch) of the screen. Screen density is grouped as low, medium, high, and extra high. Resolution is the total number of pixels on the screen. <strong>dp:</strong> Density Independent Pixel, varies based on screen density. Except for font size, use dp always. Scale Independent Pixel, scaled based on user’s font size preference. Fonts should use sp. The scaling occurs based on bucket sizes of 120(ldpi), 160(mdpi), 240(hdpi), 320(xhdpi), 480(xxhdpi), and 640(xxxhdpi). The Google suggested ratio for designing is 3:4:6:8:12 for ldpi:mdpi:hdpi:xhdpi:xxhdpi

226910,How to sanity check a date in Java,"<p>As shown by @Maglob, the basic approach is to test the conversion from string to date using <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">SimpleDateFormat.parse</a>. That will catch invalid day/month combinations like 2008-02-31.</p>

<p>However, in practice that is rarely enough since SimpleDateFormat.parse is exceedingly liberal. There are two behaviours you might be concerned with:</p>

<p><strong>Invalid characters in the date string</strong>
Surprisingly, 2008-02-2x will ""pass"" as a valid date with locale format = ""yyyy-MM-dd"" for example. Even when isLenient==false.</p>

<p><strong>Years: 2, 3 or 4 digits?</strong>
You may also want to enforce 4-digit years rather than allowing the default SimpleDateFormat behaviour (which will interpret ""12-02-31"" differently depending on whether your format was ""yyyy-MM-dd"" or ""yy-MM-dd"")</p>

<h2>A Strict Solution with the Standard Library</h2>

<p>So a complete string to date test could look like this: a combination of regex match, and then a forced date conversion. The trick with the regex is to make it locale-friendly.</p>

<pre><code>  Date parseDate(String maybeDate, String format, boolean lenient) {
    Date date = null;

    // test date string matches format structure using regex
    // - weed out illegal characters and enforce 4-digit year
    // - create the regex based on the local format string
    String reFormat = Pattern.compile(""d+|M+"").matcher(Matcher.quoteReplacement(format)).replaceAll(""\\\\d{1,2}"");
    reFormat = Pattern.compile(""y+"").matcher(reFormat).replaceAll(""\\\\d{4}"");
    if ( Pattern.compile(reFormat).matcher(maybeDate).matches() ) {

      // date string matches format structure, 
      // - now test it can be converted to a valid date
      SimpleDateFormat sdf = (SimpleDateFormat)DateFormat.getDateInstance();
      sdf.applyPattern(format);
      sdf.setLenient(lenient);
      try { date = sdf.parse(maybeDate); } catch (ParseException e) { }
    } 
    return date;
  } 

  // used like this:
  Date date = parseDate( ""21/5/2009"", ""d/M/yyyy"", false);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the regex assumes the format string contains only day, month, year, and separator characters. Aside from that, format can be in any locale format: ""d/MM/yy"", ""yyyy-MM-dd"", and so on. The format string for the current locale could be obtained like this:</p>

<pre><code>Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
SimpleDateFormat sdf = (SimpleDateFormat)DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.SHORT, locale );
String format = sdf.toPattern();
</code></pre>

<li>Seems better at being strict about invalid characters in the date string, unlike SimpleDateFormat</li>

</ol>

<p>It's quite simple to use:</p>

<p><strong>How to Design UI for Android Apps for Different Screen Size</strong></p>
<p>To design an app UI for different screen sizes, our initial design has to
meet a minimum required space for each screen size. Android defines a
minimum size (in dp) for each generalized screen type. Here is an
Android screen size guideline.

When we get the screen size in dp, it is not enough for us to design
the Android app UI. For each screen size, we need to prepare graphics
and bitmap images for each density. Here is an Android screen density
guideline.

<p>For easy calculation, we can follow the 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between
the four generalized densities. If we create a 36×36 pixel picture for
ldpi device, the rest densities pictures size will be 48×48 for mdpi,
72×72 for hdpi, and 96×96 for xhdpi.</p>

formula for dp and pixel translation.</p>
<p>As Android’s definition, 1pd equal to 1px under 160 dpi device (mdpi).
So we want to design an Android app for xlarge Android devices with
mdpi density, we can define our UI size in pixel as 960 pixels in width
and 720px in height; Follow the same mapping rule, we can get

<h1>Avoid legacy date-time classes</h1>

<p>Avoid using the troublesome old date-time classes shipped with the earliest versions of Java. Now supplanted by the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">java.time</a> classes.</p>

<h1><code>LocalDate</code> &amp; <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> &amp; <code>ResolverStyle</code></h1>

<p>The <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>LocalDate</code></a> class represents a date-only value without time-of-day and without time zone.</p>

<pre><code>String input = ""31/02/2000"";
DateTimeFormatter f = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern ( ""dd/MM/uuuu"" );
try {
    LocalDate ld = LocalDate.parse ( input , f );
    System.out.println ( ""ld: "" + ld );
} catch ( DateTimeParseException e ) {
    System.out.println ( ""ERROR: "" + e );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>java.time.DateTimeFormatter</code></a> class can be set to parse strings with any of three leniency modes defined in the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle</code></a> enum. We insert a line into the above code to try each of the modes.</p>

<pre><code>f = f.withResolverStyle ( ResolverStyle.LENIENT );
</code></pre>

<p>The results:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ResolverStyle.LENIENT</code><br />ld: 2000-03-02</li>
<li><code>ResolverStyle.SMART</code><br />ld: 2000-02-29</li>
<li><code>ResolverStyle.STRICT</code><br />ERROR: java.time.format.DateTimeParseException: Text '31/02/2000' could not be parsed: Invalid date 'FEBRUARY 31'</li>
</ul>

<p>We can see that in <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html#LENIENT"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle.LENIENT</code></a> mode, the invalid date is moved forward an equivalent number of days. In <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html#SMART"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle.SMART</code></a> mode (the default), a logical decision is made to keep the date within the month and going with the last possible day of the month, Feb 29 in a leap year, as there is no 31st day in that month. The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html#STRICT"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle.STRICT</code></a> mode throws an exception complaining that there is no such date.</p>

<p>All three of these are reasonable depending on your business problem and policies. Sounds like in your case you want the strict mode to reject the invalid date rather than adjust it.</p>

<p>compile the above with </p>

</code></pre>

<p>I use the slowAES.wsc from the other post you referenced, with 2 changes: I do not call getPaddedBlock() for the key in the EncryptString or DecryptString() methods. This really needs a PBKDF but let's not worry about that now. Here's what the modified EncryptString looks like: </p>

<pre><code>function EncryptString(plainText)
{
  // this is really wrong - need a PBBKDF to get the key, instead
  // of just using the passphrase
  var key = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(_passphrase);
  // var nkey = slowAES.getPaddedBlock(key, 0, _keysize, _mode);
  var bytesToEncrypt = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(plainText);

  var result = slowAES.encrypt(bytesToEncrypt, 
      _mode,
      key,
      _keysize,
      _iv);
  return result['cipher'];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This means you have to use a passPhrase that is <em>exactly</em> the length required by the keysize.  If you use AES256, then pass a 32-char string (32 * 8 = 256 bits).  Seems like you figured this out already. </p>

<p>The client of the WSC component is also Javascript (though it can be any COM language).  Here's what I used.</p>

2025282,"What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?","<p>The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as <strong>pixels (px)</strong>. A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable.</p>

<p>Screen resolution is measured in terms of number of pixels on the screen. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important.</p>

<p><strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device.</p>

<p>A density independent pixel (dp or dip) is equal to one pixel at the baseline density or 160 dpi (dots per inch).</p>

<p>1 px/1dp = 160 dpi/160 dpi</p>

<p>2 px/1dp = 320 dpi(2x)/160 dpi</p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>dpi is dots per inch</p>

<p>So, at 320 dpi, 1 dp is equal to 2 px.</p>

<p>Formula</p>

<p>px/dp = dpi/160dpi</p>

<p>Dots per inch (dpi) is a measure of the sharpness (that is, the density of illuminated points) on a display screen. The dots per inch for a given picture resolution will differ based on the overall screen size since the same number of pixels are being spread out over a different space.</p>

<p>Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. Suppose in a case, a tablet and phone has the same pixel resolution 1280 by 800 pixels (160 dpi) and 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi) respectively.</p>

<p>Now because a tablet is at baseline density (160 dpi) its physical and density independent pixels sizes are the same, 1280 by 800. The phone on the other hand has a higher pixel density, so it has half as many density independent pixels as physical pixels. So a phone has 400 by 640 density independent pixels. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you have two devices with similar screen size, but different pixel density, say one is 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi), and the other is 400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi), we don't need to define totally different layouts for these two devices as we can measure assets in terms of density independent pixel which is same for both devices.</p>

<p>800 by 1280 pixels (320dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p>400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p><strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size.
For accessibility purposes, Android allows users to customize their device's font size. Users that have trouble reading text can increase their device's font size. You can normally find this option in the display setting on your phone or tablet under font size. It's often also available through the accessibility settings.</p>

<p>With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. But when device's font size is large, for example 125%, 16 sp will translate to 20 dp or 1.25 times 16.</p>

<p>If you use dp as the unit for font size, then that piece of text has a specific physical size no matter if the user has customize device's font size. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.</p>

226953,WCF and confirmations - do I need to send back a 'OK got it' to client?,"<p>There are three messaging patterns mentioned here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Synchronous request-response    </li>
<li>Asynchronous send (fire and forget with one-way service)</li>
<li>Asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service)</li>
</ol>

<p>All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. </p>

<p>For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate.</p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default configuration.</p>

<p>This returns a 200 response on the same http connection once the service has completed all its tasks. This means that calls to the service will block while waiting for the response - your client will hang until the service has written to the database and done anything else it needs.</p>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 returned indicates that the message has been accepted. From the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http rfc</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. (...) The 202 response is intentionally non-committal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. </p>

<hr>

<p>Below is some more info about implementing these patterns in WCF. After writing it, it is pretty long but there are a couple of useful comments as well as the code.</p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default behaviour in WCF so you should not need to do anything - it works with lots of different bindings including wsHttpBinding and basicHttpBinding.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that the behaviour described with your client hanging waiting for the 200 response occurrs even if you have a void Operation like so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>To set an operation as one-way you simply decorate it as so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Methods decorated in this way must only have a return type of void. One gotcha is that the service will happily build and you won't get an exception saying the service config is invalid until you connect to it.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>The interface code for creating a duplex callback service is:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract(CallbackContract = typeof(IMyContractCallback))]
interface IMyContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay=true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}

public interface IMyContractCallback
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void ServiceResponse(string result);      
}
</code></pre>

<p>And on the client side you need something like so to set up the callback:</p>

<pre><code>public class CallbackHandler : IMyContractCallback        
{
    #region IEchoContractCallback Members

    public void ServiceResponse(string result)
    {
        //Do something with the response
    }

    #endregion
}

// And in the client when you set up the service call:

InstanceContext instanceContext = new InstanceContext(new CallbackHandler());
MyContractClient client = new MyContractClient(instanceContext);

InputMessage msg = new InputMessage();

client.DoSomething(msg);           
</code></pre>

<p>In the service you would perhaps have some code like:</p>

<pre><code>class MyContractImplementation : IMyContract
{
    public void DoSomeThing(MyMessage Message)
    {

        string responseMessage;

        try
        {
           //Write to the database
           responseMessage = ""The database call was good!"";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            responseMessage = ex.Message;
        }

        Callback.ServiceResponse(responseMessage);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. If you: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Consume an exception, you will get no warning of the error (but the callback will happen)</p></li>
<li><p>Throw an unhandled exception, the service will terminate and the client will not even get the callback.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown.</p>
","WCF has three messaging patterns: synchronous request-response, asynchronous send (one-way service), and asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service). For returning a success to the client when data is persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are suitable.",,"There are three messaging patterns mentioned here: All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate. Option 2
Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not. Option 3
Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. As Whisk mentioned, Juval Lowy has an article covering a lot this detail (and more!) One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown."

<p>Loading is 2.3x faster than your PIL-based code.</p>

<p>Your PIL code also has an unneeded copy: <code>array(img)</code> should be <code>asarray(img)</code>. It only costs 5% of the slow loading time. But after optimization this will be significant and you have to keep in mind which numpy operators create a copy.</p>

<h3>Fast decompression</h3>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/zstd/"" rel=""noreferrer"">zstd benchmarks</a>, when optimizing for decompression <a href=""https://python-lz4.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">lz4</a> is a good choice.

pickle (uncompressed)  601M   1.0 (baseline)
</code></pre>

<p>The load time was measured inside Python (3.7.3), using the minimum wall-clock time over 20 runs on my desktop. According to occasional glances at <code>top</code> it always seemed to be running on a single core.</p>

<h3>For the curious: profiling</h3>

<p>I'm not sure if the Python version matters, most work is supposed to happen inside of C libraries. To validate this I've profiled the <code>pickle + lz4</code> variant:</p>

<pre><code>perf record ./test.py &amp;&amp; perf report -s dso
Overhead  Shared Object
  60.16%  [kernel.kallsyms]  # mostly page_fault and alloc_pages_vma
  27.53%  libc-2.28.so       # mainly memmove
   9.75%  liblz4.so.1.8.3    # only LZ4_decompress_*
   2.33%  python3.7
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>Most time is spent inside of the Linux kernel, doing <code>page_fault</code> and stuff associated with (re-)allocating memory, probably including disk I/O. The high amount of <code>memmove</code> looks suspicious. Probably Python is re-allocating (resizing) the final array every time a new decompressed chunk arrives.

39900331,Why doesn't CLion link my project with OpenCV for Windows?,"<p>The short answer is, <strong>you will probably need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</strong>.  But given the number and range of partially answered and unanswered questions here* and elsewhere on using <a href=""https://www.jetbrains.com/clion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JetBrains' CLion IDE</a> with <a href=""http://opencv.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the OpenCV library</a>, I think an overview is needed (my notes are from CLion 2016.3 and OpenCV 3.1, YMMV):</p>

<ul>
<li>Though not produced by JetBrains, <a href=""https://cmake.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMake</a> is very central to CLion's operation.  Understanding CMake therefore helps greatly in diagnosing CLion build problems.  In particular CMake maintains a disk ""cache"" of settings which you may need to clear to incorporate changes to your environment (<em>Tools->CMake->Reset Cache and Reload Project</em>).</li>
<li><p>To make use of <em>OpenCV</em> in your build you must specify it in your project's <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> file.  You request that CMake locate your OpenCV location and link it to your <code>TARGET</code>.  An example of a sequence of commands from <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> for an executable named <code>mushroom</code> follows:
<code>
add_executable(mushroom ${SOURCE_FILES})
FIND_PACKAGE(OpenCV REQUIRED)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(mushroom ${OpenCV_LIBS})</code></p>

<p>(For more on <code>FIND_PACKAGE</code>, see <a href=""https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:How_To_Find_Libraries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMake:How To Find Libraries</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>FIND_PACKAGE</code> for package <em>XXX</em> works either by way of <em>FindXXX.cmake</em> files located at CMake's <code>Modules</code> directory, or by consulting environment variable <em>XXXX_DIR</em>.  On my system, no <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> file was present, so I relied on the <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> environment variable instead.  This must be set, not to the root of your OpenCV installation, but to the <em>build</em> folder beneath it.  I used an entry in <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> to set this variable, e.g.:</p>

<pre>set(OpenCV_DIR C:/Users/myacct/AppData/Local/opencv-3.0.0/build)</pre></li>
<li><p>To link with OpenCV, CMake uses either <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> or <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> (see previous point above) to locate a file named <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em>.  This file is generated by and ships with a particular build of OpenCV in order to document what components are present and where they are located.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Problems may occur when variable names used by OpenCVConfig.cmake conflict with those CLion has stored in its environment</em></strong>. In particular, if your OpenCV was built by Microsoft Visual C (<em>MSVC</em>), as is <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Windows distribution from opencv.org</a>, it won't work with CLion.    </p>

<p>Because CLion's build toolchain (<kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>S</kbd>-toolchain) uses either MinGW or Cygwin, <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> will search for OpenCV binaries under a subdirectory named <em>mingw</em> or <em>cygwin</em> <strong><em>and will find none</em></strong> because the binaries were built with MSVC (it will look in a directory like <em>vc11</em> or <em>vc12</em> instead).  This probably means <strong><em>you will need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</em></strong>.</p>

<p><em>Would reconfiguring OpenCVConfig.cmake to point to the MSVC binaries make this work?</em> you may ask.

<li><p><em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> or <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> likely contain diagnostic messages, but when CLion executes CMake for you, <code>message(STATUS)</code> calls are not displayed.  To make them display, change them to <code>message(WARNING)</code> or <code>message(FATAL_ERROR)</code>.  <em>But CLion 2016.3 EAP relieves this problem; see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/39398373/5025060"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/39398373/5025060</a>.</em></p></li>

","To use OpenCV with CLion, you need to build OpenCV from source. The issue is that OpenCV is built with Microsoft Visual C (MSVC) and CLion's build toolchain uses MinGW",,"The short answer is, <strong>you will probably need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</strong>. But given the number and range of partially answered and unanswered questions here* and elsewhere on using JetBrains' CLion IDE with the OpenCV library, I think an overview is needed (my notes are from CLion 2016.3 and OpenCV 3.1, YMMV): This probably means <strong><em>you will need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</em></strong>.

56708673,Python decompression relative performance?,"<h2>You can use Python-blosc</h2>
<p>It is <a href=""https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very fast</a> and for small arrays (&lt;2GB) also quite easy to use. On easily compressable data like your example, it is often faster to compress the data for IO operations. (SATA-SSD: about 500 MB/s, PCIe- SSD: up to 3500MB/s) In the decompression step the array allocation is the most costly part. If your images are of similar shape you can avoid repeated memory allocation.</p>

3949217,Time complexity of Hash table,"<p>For some uses of hash tables, it's impossible to create them of the ""right"" size in advance, because it is not known how many elements will need to be held simultaneously during the lifetime of the table. If you want to keep fast access, you need to resize the table from time to time as the number of element grows. This resizing takes linear time with respect to the number of elements already in the table, and is usually done on an insertion, when the number elements passes a threshold.</p>

<p>These resizing operations can be made seldom enough that the amortized cost of insertion is still constant (by following a geometric progression for the size of the table, for instance doubling the size each time it is resized). But one insertion from time to time takes O(n) time because it triggers a resize.</p>

<p>In practice, this is not a problem unless you are building hard real-time applications.</p>

38107999,Why postgres show two different format for same interval value?,"<p>When an interval is <strong>a difference between two timestamps</strong> it is always justified to hours (i.e. it has <em>standard</em> format). Examples:</p>

<pre><code>select
    '2015-01-01 13:0:0'::timestamp - '2014-01-01 23:0:0'::timestamp, --&gt; 364 days 14:00:00
    '2015-01-01 13:0:0'::timestamp - '2014-01-01 03:0:0'::timestamp, --&gt; 365 days 10:00:00
    '2015-01-01 13:0:0'::timestamp - '2015-01-01 03:0:0'::timestamp; --&gt; 10:00:00
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Calculations on intervals</strong> are executed on date part and time part separately, so they may lead to strange formats. Examples:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    '2 day 1:00:00'::interval- '1 day 2:00:00'::interval,    --&gt; 1 day -01:00:00 (!!)
    '2 day 100:00:00'::interval+ '1 day 60:00:00'::interval, --&gt; 3 days 160:00:00
    '2 day 100:00:00'::interval- '2 day 60:00:00'::interval; --&gt; 40:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>For such cases Postgres developers provided the appropriate function for the <em>format standardization</em>:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    justify_hours('1 day -01:00:00'),  --&gt; 23:00:00
    justify_hours('3 days 160:00:00'), --&gt; 9 days 16:00:00
    justify_hours('40:00:00');         --&gt; 1 day 16:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>However they did not think that the reverse operation would be needful. In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38082414/1995738"">this answer</a> I proposed a function to convert a date part of an interval to hours. I think it can be (with some minor changes) some kind of <em>reverse function</em> for <code>justify_hours()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>create or replace function unjustify_hours(interval)
returns interval language sql as $$
    select format('%s:%s',
        (extract (epoch from $1) / 3600)::int,
        to_char($1, 'mi:ss'))::interval;
$$;

select 
    unjustify_hours('23:00:00'),        --&gt; 23:00:00
    unjustify_hours('9 days 16:00:00'), --&gt; 232:00:00
    unjustify_hours('1 day 16:00:00');  --&gt; 40:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>to_char(interval, text)</code> cannot be helpful here, as</p>

<pre><code>select 
    to_char(interval '23:00:00', 'hh24:mi:ss'),        --&gt; 23:00:00
    to_char(interval '9 days 16:00:00', 'hh24:mi:ss'), --&gt; 16:00:00 (!)
    to_char(interval '1 day 16:00:00',  'hh24:mi:ss'); --&gt; 16:00:00 (!)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that an interval can be correctly formatted in many ways:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    justify_hours('100:00:00'),        --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
    justify_hours('1 days 76:00:00'),  --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
    justify_hours('2 days 52:00:00'),  --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
    justify_hours('5 days -20:00:00'); --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>Per <a href=""https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype-datetime.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the SQL standard all fields of an interval value must
  have the same sign, so a leading negative sign applies to all fields;
  for example the negative sign in the interval literal '-1 2:03:04'
  applies to both the days and hour/minute/second parts. PostgreSQL
  allows the fields to have different signs, and traditionally treats
  each field in the textual representation as independently signed, so
  that the hour/minute/second part is considered positive in this
  example. If IntervalStyle is set to sql_standard then a leading sign
  is considered to apply to all fields (but only if no additional signs
  appear). Otherwise the traditional PostgreSQL interpretation is used.
  To avoid ambiguity, it's recommended to attach an explicit sign to
  each field if any field is negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internally interval values are stored as months, days, and seconds.
  This is done because the number of days in a month varies, and a day
  can have 23 or 25 hours if a daylight savings time adjustment is
  involved. The months and days fields are integers while the seconds
  field can store fractions. Because intervals are usually created from
  constant strings or timestamp subtraction, this storage method works
  well in most cases. Functions justify_days and justify_hours are
  available for adjusting days and hours that overflow their normal
  ranges.</p>
</blockquote>

1335851,"What does ""use strict"" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?","<p>Strict mode eliminates errors that would be ignored in non-strict mode, thus making javascript “more secured”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it considered among best practices?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, It's considered part of the best practices while working with javascript to include <em>Strict mode</em>. This is done by adding the below line of code in your JS file.</p>
<p><code>'use strict'; </code></p>
<p>in your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean to user agents?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indicating that code should be interpreted in strict mode specifies to user agents like browsers that they should treat code literally as written, and throw an error if the code doesn't make sense.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> Consider in your <code>.js</code> file you have the following code:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: [NO STRICT MODE]</strong></p>
<pre><code>var city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Prints the city name, i.e. Chicago
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: [NO STRICT MODE]</strong></p>
<pre><code>city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Prints the city name, i.e. Chicago
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>So why does the variable name is being printed in both cases?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without strict mode turned on, user agents often go through a series of modifications to problematic code in an attempt to get it to make sense. On the surface, this can seem like a fine thing, and indeed, working outside of strict mode makes it possible for people to get their feet wet with JavaScript code without having all the details quite nailed down. However, as a developer, I don't want to leave a bug in my code, because I know it could come back and bite me later on, and I also just want to write good code. And that's where strict mode helps out.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: [STRICT MODE]</strong></p>
<pre><code>'use strict';

city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Reference Error: asignment is undeclared variable city.
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>Additional tip:</strong></em> To maintain code quality using strict mode, you don't need to write this over and again especially if you have multiple <code>.js</code> file. You can enforce this rule globally in <code>eslint</code> rules as follows:</p>
<p><em>Filename:</em> <code>.eslintrc.js</code></p>
<pre><code>module.exports = {
    env: {
        es6: true
    },
    rules : {
        strict: ['error', 'global'],
        },
    };
    
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so what is prevented in strict mode?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Using a variable without declaring it</em> will throw an error in strict mode. This is to prevent unintentionally creating global variables throughout your application. The example with printing Chicago covers this in particular.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Deleting a variable or a function or an argument</em> is a no-no in strict mode.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;use strict&quot;;
 function x(p1, p2) {}; 
 delete x; // This will cause an error
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><em>Duplicating a parameter name</em> is <strong>not</strong> allowed in strict mode.</p>
<pre><code> &quot;use strict&quot;;
 function x(p1, p1) {};   // This will cause an error
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><em>Reserved words in the Javascript language are not allowed</em> in strict mode. The words are implements interface, let, packages, private, protected, public. static, and yield</p>

<p>Please check the function below written in non-strict mode:</p>

<pre><code>function getname(){
    name = ""Stack Overflow""; // Not using var keyword
    return name;
}
getname();
console.log(name); // Stack Overflow
</code></pre>

<p>In this function, we are using a variable called <code>name</code> inside the function. Internally, the compiler will first check if there is any variable declared with that particular name in that particular function scope. Since the compiler understood that there is no such variable, it will check in the outer scope. In our case, it is the global scope. Again, the compiler understood that there is also no variable declared in the global space with that name, so it creates such a variable for us in the global space. Conceptually, this variable will be created in the global scope and will be available in the entire application.</p>

<p>Another scenario is that, say, the variable is declared in a child function. In that case, the compiler checks the validity of that variable in the outer scope, i.e., the parent function. Only then it will check in the global space and create a variable for us there.
That means additional checks need to be done. This will affect the performance of the application.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now let's write the same function in strict mode.</p>

<pre><code>""use strict""
function getname(){
    name = ""Stack Overflow""; // Not using var keyword

<pre><code>Uncaught ReferenceError: name is not defined
at getname (&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:15)
at &lt;anonymous&gt;:6:5

<p>Here, the compiler throws the reference error. In strict mode, the compiler does not allow us to use the variable without declaring it. So memory leaks can be prevented. In addition, we can write more optimized code.</p>

<li>Are they looking for ""John"" who lives on ""Hamburg Street"" in Springfield? </li>
<li>Are they looking for ""John"" who lives in the city of ""Hamburg""?</li>

<p>Without knowing the user's intent, the best you can hope for is to OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits.</p>

<p>2 words:</p>

<p>Search Employee data for term 1, Search Employee data for term 2, Search Address data for term 1, Search address data for term 2.  Merge results by term, order by most hits.</p>

<p>3 words:</p>

<p>I guess I would redesign the GUI to separate the input into Name and Address, at a minimum.  If that is not possible, enforce a syntax rule to the effect ""First words will be considered a name until a comma appears, any words after that will be considered addresses""</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Your best bet is still OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits.  Here's an example of that, and an example why this is not ideal without some pre-processing of the input to divine the user's intent:</p>

<pre><code>insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (1, 'John Hamburg')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (2, 'John Smith')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (3, 'Bob Hamburg')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (4, 'Bob Smith')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (5, 'John Doe')

insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (1, 'Main St.', 'Springville', 1)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (2, 'Hamburg St.', 'Springville', 2)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (3, 'St. John Ave.', 'Springville', 3)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (4, '5th Ave.', 'Hamburg', 4)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (5, 'Oak Lane', 'Hamburg', 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Now since we don't know what keywords will apply to what table, we have to assume they could apply to either table, so we have to OR the terms against each table, UNION the results, Aggregate them, and compute the highest rank.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, [Name], Street, City, SUM([Rank])
FROM
(
    SELECT emp.Id, [Name], Street, City, [Rank]
    FROM Employee emp 
    JOIN [Address] addr ON emp.Id = addr.EmployeeId
    JOIN CONTAINSTABLE(Employee, *, 'JOHN OR Hamburg') AS keyTblEmp ON emp.Id = keyTblEmp.[KEY]

    UNION ALL

<blockquote>

<p>Rake processes end when they're over. So, if you're doing any sort of data changes, rake tasks won't be open long enough to run a job, which is why they run <code>:inline</code> just fine, but not <code>:async</code>.</p>

<p>So, I haven't figured out a solution to keep rake tasks open long enough to run something <code>:async</code> (and keep the app <code>:async</code> the entire time). I have to switch it to <code>:inline</code> to run tasks, and then back to <code>:async</code> when I'm done for the rest of my jobs.

38315538,JavaScript | Angular | Controller As Syntax: Cannot Use `this`,"<p>The problem is certainly <strong>not</strong> that <code>this</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript.
There is no rule in the <em>controller as</em> syntax that says you would need to assign the value of <code>this</code> to a variable with the same name as the controller and I'm pertty sure angular won't do such thing either. Why would it? That would be incredibly stupid use of <code>Function</code> constructor and just a needless bug.</p>

<p>There's a simple way to test that JavaScript reserved words are not the issue here. Name your controller ""throw"". <code>""Parent as throw""</code>. <code>throw</code> is a reserved word, but does that <em>throw</em> errors? No. Does that work? Yes.</p>

<p><code>this</code> is, however, reserved in the context of angular's own template expressions. It's used to refer to the current <code>scope</code> of the expression.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=""Parent as this""&gt;
    {{log(this)}}
&lt;/div&gt;


angular.module('testApp', []).controller('Parent', function($scope){
    this.test = 'foo';
    $scope.log = function(arg){
        console.log(arg);
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>The above won't throw errors, but it won't log the controller either. Instead, it will log a <em>scope</em> object containing the <code>log</code> function and <code>$parent</code> and what not. </p>

<p>In fact, it will also contain something intresting to us: property <code>this: Object</code>, our controller. </p>

<p>And sure enough, change the template expression to <code>{{log(this.this)}}</code> and it will log the controller instance just fine. Still wouldn't use <code>'this'</code> as the name though, it would probably just cause more bugs by mistake than undefined functions ever have.</p>

1816723,Best practice for structuring a 'large' Rails app,"<p>I believe the benefits of isolating your concerns into separate apps outweigh the costs. I would probably start off with just 2 apps (one for the main site and superadmin, one for the client sites and admins), accessing the same database, but you could do 4.</p>

<p>The downside is you don't really have isolation since all your apps are tied to one database. You will eventually run into scaling problems with your database, but starting off simple with one database will get you launched. One strategy for scaling later would be to add a slave db that the client site and main site apps use, while the admin apps use the master db. This along with a TON of caching will get you pretty far.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with having multiple rails apps access one db, however you will need a way to share common code across your apps. Your models for the most part. I've done this before by tossing all my models in a plugin that I share as a sub-module in git or as an external in svn. Having separate apps will make each app smaller and easier to maintain.</p>

<p>However, where do you keep your migrations? Where do you test your models? I would opt for the superadmin app. Also, you make a change to a model or the schema, and now you have to check 2-4 apps and make sure they still work!</p>

37774347,Why is my implementation of a map on a custom type not correct?,"<p>First, to explain the error message: you can't use <code>filter</code> in your definition, since</p>

<pre><code> filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
</code></pre>

<p>has to do with regular Prelude lists, not your <code>List</code>s -- i.e. <code>[a]</code> not <code>List a</code>. The error message arises because <code>filter</code> expects <code>a</code> in </p>

<pre><code> map f a = filter (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a
</code></pre>

<p>to be a list of something, but the signature you supplied declares that <code>a</code> is a <code>List</code> of something. Similarly <code>filter</code> returns a Prelude list of something, but the signature requires that it return a <code>List</code> of something. </p>

<p>The natural implementation of <code>map</code> for <code>List</code> would distinguish the cases of <code>List</code> that you gave in the type declaration, that is, it would ""pattern match"":</p>

<pre><code>mapList ::
    (a -&gt; b)
    -&gt; List a
    -&gt; List b
mapList f Nil = Nil
mapList f (t :. ls) = f t :. mapList f ls
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the program you wrote is perfectly valid, it just conflicts with the signature you gave it:</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let mapX f a = filter (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a
ghci&gt; :t mapX
mapX :: Eq a =&gt; t -&gt; [List a] -&gt; [List a]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Eq</code> constraint is required because you presuppose that <code>List</code>s be tested for equality and thus that their elements can be.  <code>f</code> is not used, so it just ends up as a 'could be anything' parameter, here <code>t</code>. </p>

<p>Of course, if you have your own <code>filterList</code> for <code>List</code>s it will also typecheck</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let filterList pred Nil = Nil; filterList pred (a :. as) = if pred a then a :. filterList pred as else filterList pred as

ghci&gt; :t filterList
filterList :: (t -&gt; Bool) -&gt; List t -&gt; List t

<p>With <strong>Text File Input</strong> there are a lot more options available to you for reading the file. You can set the <em>Filetype</em> as CSV and select your separator in the <em>Content</em> tab, and list out the fields you want to grab in the <em>Fields</em> tab. Using this step would solve your problem because in the <em>Additional output fields</em> tab you can specify a field in the stream to put your filename, extension, file path, etc.</p>

<p>The advantages you gain when using the <strong>CSV Input</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>NIO: Native system calls for reading the file means faster performance, but it is limited to only local files currently. No VFS support.</li>
<li>Parallel running: If you configure this step to run in multiple copies or in clustered mode, and you enable parallel running, each copy will read a separate block of a single file allowing you to distribute the file reading to several threads or even several slave nodes in a clustered transformation.</li>
<li>Lazy conversion: If you will be reading many fields from the file and many of those fields will not be manipulate, but merely passed through the transformation to land in some other text file or a database, lazy conversion can prevent Kettle from performing unnecessary work on those fields such as converting them into objects such as strings, dates, or numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need those advantages then you'll have to get at your file name another way, such as passing it as a named parameter and adding it to the stream with the Get Variables step.</p>

57038055,"What are ""Activations"", ""Activation Gradients"", ""Weights"" and ""Weight Gradients"" in Convolutional Neural Networks?","<p>This question is similar to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38136058/6873133"">this</a> question, but not quite. Also, <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs#example-code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the ConvNetJS example code with comments (<a href=""https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/docs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the full documentation). You can take a look at the code at the top of the demo page for the code itself.</p>

<p>An <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">activation function</a> is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some ""threshold"" (this is specific for each different activation function). This comes from how neurons work, where they take some electrical input and will only activate if they reach some threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 1:</strong> The first set of images show the raw input image (the left colored image) and the right of the two images is the output after going through the activation functions. You shouldn't really be able to interpret the second image because it is going through non-linear and perceived random non-linear transformations through the network.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 2:</strong> Similar to the previous point, the ""activations"" are the functions the image pixel information is passed into. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gradient</a> is essentially the slope of the activation function. It appears more sparse (i.e., colors show up in only certain places) because it shows possible areas in the image that each node is focusing on. For example, the 6th image on the first row has some color in the bottom left corner; this may indicate a large change in the activation function to indicate something interesting in this area. This <a href=""https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> may clear up some confusion on weights and activation functions. And <a href=""https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> has some really great visuals on what each step is doing.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 3:</strong> This confused me at first, because if you think about a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ReLu function</a>, you will see that it has a slope of one for positive <code>x</code> and 0 everywhere else. So to take the gradient (or slope) of the activation function (ReLu in this case) doesn't make sense. The ""max activation"" and ""min activation"" values make sense for a ReLu: the minimum value will be zero and the max is whatever the maximum value is. This is straight from the definition of a ReLu. <s>To explain the gradient values, I suspect that some Gaussian noise and a <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs/blob/4c3358a315b4d71f31a0d532eb5d1700e9e592ee/src/convnet_net.js#L43"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bias term of 0.1</a> has been added to those values.</s> <strong>Edit:</strong> the gradient refers to the slope of the cost-weight curve shown below. The y-axis is the loss value or the calculated error using the weight values <strong>w</strong> on the x-axis.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 4:</strong> See above.</p>
","In a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), key concepts include:

- **Activation functions**: Non-linear functions that take input and output a value based on a threshold, mimicking how neurons work.
- **Activation Gradients**: The slope of the activation function, showing areas where the network focuses.
- **Weights**: Values that influence the activation function, affecting the output.
- **Weight Gradients**: The slope of the cost-weight curve, indicating how the loss changes with weight values.",,"An activation function is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some ""threshold"" (this is specific for each different activation function).

21428179,Event ports with Firebird 1.0.3 and firewall setup,"<p>By default Firebird uses a random port for events. This doesn't work well with firewalls, so Firebird also offers an option to use a fixed port, using the <code>RemoteAuxPort</code> setting in <code>firebird.conf</code>. This option was added in Firebird 1.5, see the <a href=""http://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/release_notes/html/rlsnotes15.html#config-fb-conf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Firebird 1.5 release notes</a>. Migrating from Firebird 1.0 to Firebird 1.5 should be relatively easy (migrating to more recent versions like Firebird 2.5 might be more work).</p>
<p>For details look at the section <em>Common Problems: Firewalls</em> in <a href=""http://www.flamerobin.org/events_paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Power of Firebird Events</a> by Milan Babuškov:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client has a regular connection to Firebird server at its port (3050 by default, but can be changed). When it is registering for events, it sends the request over that connection. The server opens another connection at some random port (4012 for example) and sends that port number to the client. The client then connects to that port.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>When client registers for events, the server opens a random port (ex. 6023) and sends that info to the client. This is where the problem becomes evident: the client tries to connect to that port (6023) on the firewall (as it “sees” the firewall as a server). Since the port is completely random, there are certainly no forwarding rules for that port on the firewall, so connection is denied. Using this setup, there is no way to make it work, short of forwarding all the traffic (all ports) to Firebird server, which is the exact thing we wish to avoid by placing the firewall in front.</p>

This has been fixed for all applications on macOS 10.13.

  <p>Unhiding rows with the method -unhideRowsAtIndexes:withAnimation: did not work correctly prior to macOS 10.13 when using non-contiguous sets of rows. This has been fixed for all applications on macOS 10.13.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll notice in the second paragraph that your issue is mentioned.</p>

<p>If you’re developing for an earlier version of macOS, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>func unhideRows(at indexes: IndexSet, animation: NSTableView.AnimationOptions = []) {
    if #available(macOS 10.13, *) {
        outlineView.unhideRows(
            at: indexes,
            withAnimation: animation
        )
    } else {
        for range in indexes.rangeView {
            outlineView.unhideRows(
                at: IndexSet(integersIn: range),
                withAnimation: animation
            )
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I wish I could say that this fixes the problem 100% of the time, however, that doesn't seem to be the case. Every once in awhile, I still seem to run into bounds exceptions like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>-[__NSArrayM objectAtIndex:]: index 11 beyond bounds [0 .. 10]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be due to other factors, such as my semi-complex filtering code, but as I can’t actually see what Apple’s doing in its <code>NSTableView</code> methods like <code>_updateVisibleViewsBasedOnUpdateItems</code>, I’m just not sure.</p>

<p>Oh, well. I thought I should post an answer so other folks struggling with this issue are aware of the bug. Good luck and safe travels, my fellow earthling.</p>
","NSTableView's `unhideRowsAtIndexes` method has a bug in macOS versions prior to 10.13. To fix it, you can use a workaround by implementing variable row heights or use the following code to unhide rows: 

```csharp
func unhideRows(at indexes: IndexSet, animation: NSTableView.AnimationOptions = []) {
    if #available(macOS 10.13, *) {
        outlineView.unhideRows(
            at: indexes,
            withAnimation: animation
        )
    } else {
        for range in indexes.rangeView {
            outlineView.unhideRows(
                at: IndexSet(integersIn: range),
                withAnimation: animation
            )
        }
    }
}

<p>For example, you might have a Person object that captures the identify of a particular person.</p>

Each instance of Student would have a reference to the person enrolled. A single person may be related to many ""Student"" records, one for each distinct enrolment.</p>

<p>With this statement,</p>

<pre><code>public class Derived1 : Base&lt;Derived1&gt; {
</code></pre>

<p>you're using Derived1 in two different ways according to the base class.  </p>

<p>You're effectively telling the C# compiler that Derived1 both: </p>

<ol>
<li>inherits Base </li>
<li>and Base uses instances of Derived1 through non-inheritance means.  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is not wrong (if that's what you really want), but it's unusual for most programming scenarios; you normally choose one or the other. However the benefit of your logic is: not only do you have an implicit instance of Derived1 through inheritance (same for any other derived class), but the base class can <em>also</em> handle other external instances of that same derived type through the type parameter <code>&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<p>One problem I see in the Base class is it turns into a kind of circular scenario when using the factory method as intended, because, to support all derived classes it would need to support something like <code>class Base&lt;T&gt; where T:Base&lt;T&gt;</code>. That's next to impossible to declare because you would have to say in a circular fashion: <code>Base&lt;Base&lt;Base&lt;!!!&gt;&gt;&gt; baseref = null;</code> where !!! represents an infinite number of the same. </p>

<hr>

<h2>One Solution...</h2>

<p>One possible (and strong solution) is to move the Type parameter from the class to the factory Create method and restrict its usage to the Base class type like so:</p>

    public static T Create&lt;T&gt;() where T : Base
    {
        return Activator.CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;();
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I have made the base class abstract which restricts instantiation to the derived types; however <strong>you can still use base class references</strong> (see <code>switch</code> statement usage below).    </p>

<p>These derived classes still inherit from base. </p>

<pre><code>public class Derived1 : Base
{
}

public class Derived2 : Base
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your factory method is restricted to create only instances of derived types.  The logic has been swapped around so the derived type is given to the factory method instead of the factory method being called on it.</p>

37255878,How to schedule action at various timings from a list in Python,"<p>busfault is correct about your use of the FOR loop.</p>

<p>To test it using <code>yield</code>, you need to <code>schedule</code> the called function.

Another option to prove its todo wit refreshing is simply to change your refresh rate and see if the time differences vary accordingly.</p>

37141927,Is there a way to ignore components PreferredSize?,"<p>There is no such concept as ""units"" in GridBagLayout. A GBL uses cells. </p>

<p>If you have two components on the first row then you have two cells. Each cell is sized by the component in the cell. </p>

<p>If you then have a component on the second row you have a couple of options. The component could be displayed in the first or second column. Or you could give the component a ""gridwidth"" of 2, which means it will fill the width of the two columns.</p>

<p>You could use the ""weightx"" constraint. It indicates how space should be allocated to a component when extra space is available. So if one component could be .20 and the other .80. This is the best way to assign space proportionally however this is only for the ""extra"" spaces. Each component will originally be sized at its preferred size.</p>

<p>If you want truly relative sizes then you can use the <a href=""https://tips4java.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/relative-layout/"" rel=""nofollow"">Relative Layout</a>. It allows you to specify the size of components relative to the total space available, so the preferred size can be ignored. </p>

  <p>Can you explain to me how to access the numbers of the array? I'm trying to print them using this, but it's printing 0 all the time:</p>

<p>For a simple printing of the array, I'm not sure how this code helps you. Without the context of the surrounding code, it's difficult for me to speculate as to what the code is doing.</p>

<p>It looks like you're trying to do your own equivalent of <code>printf(""%d"",num)</code>, but there is already a syscall to output an integer to the screen. I'd use that. But ... If you truly need to ""roll your own"", I've included code to do that.</p>

<p>Printing the array is similar to the input of the array.</p>

<p>I've reworked the previous example code. The input of the array is now a function. I removed the hardwired limit value of 250 in favor of using a new label: <code>arrend</code> [so, have a look]</p>

<p>Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array.</p>

<p>To manually do what syscall 1 does, I've added the <code>prtint</code> function. <code>arrprt</code> will use the syscall, but if you want it to use <code>prtint</code>, comment out the syscall and uncomment the block that calls <code>prtint</code></p>

<p>For a left outer join, for the same condition, there is a big difference depending on where it is placed - the join clause or the where clause.</p>

<p>Using MS SQL-Server:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @t1 TABLE ( id INT )
INSERT INTO @t1 VALUES ( 1 ),( 2 ),( 3 ),( 4 ),( 5 );

DECLARE @t2 TABLE ( id INT )
INSERT INTO @t2 VALUES ( 2 ),( 3 ),( 10 ),( 11 ),( 12 );

SELECT * FROM @t1 t1
LEFT OUTER JOIN @t2 t2 ON t2.id = t1.id
</code></pre>

<p>This gives:</p>

<pre><code>1   NULL
2   2
3   3
4   NULL
5   NULL
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, all rows from driving table with NULLs for no match from slave table.</p>

<p>For the condition in the ON clause:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM @t1 t1
LEFT OUTER JOIN @t2 t2 ON t2.id = t1.id AND t1.id = 2
</code></pre>

<p>This gives:</p>

<pre><code>1   NULL
2   2
3   NULL
4   NULL
5   NULL

<p>Here, the columns of the driving table is preserved but the join clause NULLs the non-matched row(s) in the slave table.</p>

<p>For the condition in the WHERE clause:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM @t1 t1

3949205,'Unknown key(s)' ArgumentError,"<p>Likely you need to get just the keys from the name_ids hash. Try:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(params[:name_ids].keys)

<p>A separate problem is your reference to params[:name], which is nil. Did you mean (EDIT: use to_s to match the params key, lol):</p>

<pre><code>@names.each do |name|
  name.update_attributes!(params[:name_ids][name.id.to_s].reject { |k,v| v.blank? })
end
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT (brief-ish explanation):</p>

<p>What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids]. It looked like:</p>

<pre><code>""name_ids""=&gt;{""7""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Партия"", ""which""=&gt;""Крутая""}, ""1""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""1"", ""what""=&gt;""Россия"", ""which""=&gt;""Единая""}, ""4""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Организация"", ""which""=&gt;""Молдавская""}}

<p>An ActiveRecord 'find' method can take an array of ids, but not a hash of values. What you were originally submitting to 'find' in this line:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(params[:name_ids])
</code></pre>

<p>...was the value for params[:name_ids]: </p>

<pre><code>{""7""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Партия"", ""which""=&gt;""Крутая""}, ""1""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""1"", 
""what""=&gt;""Россия"", ""which""=&gt;""Единая""}, ""4""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Организация"", 
""which""=&gt;""Молдавская""}
</code></pre>

<p>When what you wanted was:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(['7','1','4'])
</code></pre>

<p>which is what calling params[:name_ids].keys gives you. </p>

<p>The second problem was this line:</p>

<pre><code>name.update_attributes!(params[:name].reject { |k,v| v.blank? })
</code></pre>

<p>There was no value ':name' in params, so calling 'reject' on it cause the 'no method' error -- there is no 'reject' method on the nil object. What you wanted was to update the attributes for the 'name' that corresponded to the particular name in the loop. This meant you wanted to get the values out of params[:name_ids][:id] where :id was the id of 'name'. </p>

<p>It all goes back to the way fields_for created the params to begin with. This line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% fields_for ""name_ids[#{name.id}]"", name do |name_fields| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>meant that params would contain a hash called 'name_ids', with keys corresponding to name.id, that themselves would contain hashes of attributes that ActiveRecord could use in the update_attributes method. </p>

18484535,maintaining cache state in different servers,"<p>If you ultimately decide to move the cache outside your main webserver process, then you could also take a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing"" rel=""nofollow"">consistent hashing</a>. This would be a alternative to a replicated cache.</p>

<p>The problem with replicated caches, is they scale inversely proportional to the number of nodes participating in the cache. i.e. their performance degrades as you add additional nodes. They work fine when there is a small number of nodes. If data is to be replicated between N nodes (or you need to send eviction messages to N nodes), then every write requires 1 write to the cache on the originating node, and N-1 writes to the other nodes.</p>

<p>In consistent hashing, you instead define a hashing function, which takes the key of the data you want to store or retrieve as input, and it returns the id of the server in the cluster which is responsible for caching the data for that key. So each caching server is responsible for a fraction of the overall keys, the client can determine which server will contain the sought data without any lookup, and data and eviction messages do not need to be replicated between caching servers.</p>

<p>The ""consistent"" part of consistent hashing, refers to how your hashing function handles new servers being added to or removed from the cluster: some re-distribution of keys between servers is required, but the function is designed to minimize the amount of such disruption.</p>

<p>In practice, you do not actually need a dedicated caching cluster, as your caches could run in-process in your web servers; each web server being able to determine the other webserver which should store cache data for a key.</p>

<p>Consistent hashing is used at large scale. It might be overkill for you at this stage. But just be aware of the scalability bottleneck inherent in O(N) messaging architectures. A replicated cache is possibly a good idea to <em>start with</em>.</p>

<p>EDIT: Take a look at <a href=""http://infinispan.org/docs/5.3.x/faqs/faqs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Infinispan</a>, a distributed cache which indeed uses consistent hashing out of box.</p>

19389238,Why do the following program leaks memory?,"<p>You're not doing anything wrong. GTK widgets use reference counting, but in your programme all the references are taken care of, so you're not (manually) leaking anything.</p>

<p>So why does Valgrind claim you are?</p>

<p>Firstly, GLib has its own ""slab"" memory allocator, called <code>GSlice</code>, which is generally faster than system <code>malloc</code> for small allocations. Unfortunately, it confuses Valgrind, but if you set the environment variable <code>G_SLICE=always-malloc</code>, <code>GSlice</code> is effectively turned off.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can set the <code>G_DEBUG=gc-friendly</code>, which is supposed to help Valgrind produce more accurate results (although it my experience it generally doesn't make any difference).</p>

<p>Both of these environment variables are listed in the <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.38/glib-running.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GLib documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, Valgrind will still report that your app leaks memory. The reason for this is that GTK (and its underlying libraries) allocate some ""static"" memory at start-up that doesn't get freed until the programme quits. This isn't really a problem, because typically the programme ends as soon as <code>gtk_main()</code> returns, and then the OS frees any remaining resources, so you're not <em>really</em> leaking anything. Valgrind thinks you are though, and for this reason it would be nice to have a <code>gtk_deinit()</code> function, but sadly there isn't one.</p>

<p>The best you can do instead is to teach Valgrind to ignore these things, via a suppressions file. The <a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/Valgrind"" rel=""nofollow"">Valgrind page on the Gnome Wiki</a> has details on all this and more.</p>

I experienced the DnD issue as well, read below for how I worked around it
I did <em>not</em> install the GAPPs zip. It's not needed and causes a lot of crash notifications.</li>
<li>Extract up-to-date Chrome APK from my actual android device. APK's for installed apps can be found in /data/app (but this my require root) or you could use a back-up solution to extract it.</li>
<li>Install the obtained APK by also DnD'ing it into the home screen, it will automatically install.
... And it worked.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the DnD issue, in my case the cause appeared to be that I was running Genymotion 'as administrator' (Why? Complicated: Because I have an unrelated virtualBox machine using a native disk image, which requires me to start virtualbox in privileged mode, which will crash Genymotion if it's not also running in privileged mode). However when I started GenyMotion not 'as admin' the dnd issue did not appear.
If this is not the issue in your case I think you can still get the stuff installed without DnD support:</p>

<ul>
<li>First get the files on your image in some way, use your imagination (or any file sharing web service)</li>
<li>Also get an APK for a decent file explorer with ZIP and root support. I use ES file explorer and my instructions will be based in it. I suggest, as for Chrome itself, to install it on your actual phone first and then grab the APK.</li>
<li>Install the file explorer, start it and become root (ES crashed the first couple of times in my case, but after some tries it worked)</li>
<li>make sure /system is mounted as r/w. in ES, use menu->root explorer->mount R/W, put /system on RW</li>
<li>Locate the Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1.zip, browse into it, select (long press) 'system' folder, extract to, 'choose path', point to /. The Zip will now be 'installed'</li>
<li>Go back to root explorer options, put /system back to RO</li>
<li>Reboot the emulator (in my case it crashed both on shutdown and first boot; I just closed the emulator after a few minutes and tried again. Then it worked)</li>
<li>Now you should be able to install the Chrome APK</li>
</ul>
","To install Google Play/Chrome on Genymotion:

1. Install libhoudini and extract the Genymotion-ARM-Translation zip.

  <p>How can I find vulnerabilities in this code?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With experience, a good set of compiler options, a static source code analyzer, a dynamic analyzer, ... anything you know how to use. If you don't know how to use such, I'm afraid that you have to learn.</p>

<p>You can find the worst problems by raising the warning level of your compiler to the max and even give option like <code>-pedantic</code> for GCC. The same applies to the analyzers of which the static kind is quite simple to use.</p>

<p>Then you can build tables of possible control and data flows. For instance <code>scanf()</code> can do anything of these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read nothing at all into <code>t1</code> leaving it completely uninitialized, perhaps because of I/O errors.</li>
<li>Read a zero length string; just one character, <code>'\0'</code>, will be stored in <code>t1</code>.</li>
<li>Read anything between the previous and the next length.</li>
<li>Read a string filling <code>t1</code> up to the last character, but not overflowing it.</li>
<li>Read a string longer than <code>t1</code> provides space for.</li>
<li>Read a string very much longer than <code>t1</code> provides space for.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of these might have the same effect, beware. Then think about what will happen further down the control flow.</p>

<p>Do this for every function call, every assignment, and every instruction. Some instructions are simple and don't do any harm, others are quite tricky. You have to read the documentation of the functions carefully, and the C standard, may be more than one version of it.</p>

<p>There are some traps to distract you from the real errors, too.</p>

<h2>Update on how the <code>REQ/REP</code> works :</h2>

<p>The <strong><code>REQ/REP</code></strong> Scalable Communication Pattern Archetype works like a distributed pair of people - one, let's call her Mary, asks ( Mary <code>.send()</code>-s the <strong><code>REQ</code></strong> ), while the other one, say Bob the <strong><code>REP</code></strong> listens in a potentially infinitely long blocking <code>.recv()</code> ( or takes a due care, using <code>.poll()</code> to orderly and regularly check, if Mary has asked about something or not and continues to do his own hobbies or gardening otherwise ) and once the Bob's end gets a message, Bob can go and <code>.send()</code> Mary a reply ( not before, as he knows nothing when and what Mary would ( or would not ) ask in the nearer of farther future ) ) and Mary is fair not to ask her next <code>REQ.send()</code>-question to Bob anytime sooner but after Bob has ( <code>REP.send()</code> ) replied and Mary has received Bob's message ( <code>REQ.recv()</code> ) - which is fair and more symmetric, than a real life may exhibit among real people under one roof :o)</p>

<p>The code?</p>

<p>The code is not a reproducible MCVE. The <code>main()</code> creates five Bobs ( hanging waiting a call from Mary, somewhere over <code>inproc://</code> transport-class ), but no Mary ever calls, or does she? Not visible sign of any Mary trying to do so, the less her ( their, could be a (even a dynamic) community of N:M herd-of-Mary(s):herd-of-5-Bobs relation ) attempt(s) to handle REP-ly(s) coming from either one of the 5-Bobs.</p>

","The modern Date-Time API in Java recommends using `java.time` instead of `java.util.Date` and `SimpleDateFormat`. 

Here is a solution using `java.time` to parse a date string with a specific format:

<p><strong>Brute Force</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>pros</strong></em>: can achieved by checking all universe(input) as the next step</li>
<li><em><strong>pros</strong></em>: super easy</li>
<li><em><strong>pros</strong></em>: it's good for tiny dataset with limited states</li>
<li><em><strong>cons</strong></em>: connections doesn't stored so each time you have to perform a search</li>
<li><em><strong>cons</strong></em>: has the worst time complexity.</li>

<h2><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/b8FIV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/b8FIV.png"" alt=""Trie from Wikipedia"" /></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>pros</strong></em>: it is the simplest data structure designed for these kind of problems.</li>
<li><em><strong>pros</strong></em>: list of all available next states are stored in each state.</li>
<li><em><strong>cons</strong></em>: data size should be small( at most should be a low fractional of RAM size).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a></strong> :</p>
<p>Trie has space problem so other data structures main goal is reducing the space complexity. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a> is one of the options. by using DAG you can merge all similar subpath to only one. as a result much of space will be reserved.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Some other Tree options</strong> :</p>
<p>On each state(or Node) there is a search problem. linear search is the worst case option so most strategies improved their search time by using either sorting( <em>O(nlog(n)</em> ) and then using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Binary search</a>( <em>O(log(n)</em>) ) or using a hashtable ( <em>O(1)</em>, fast but has more space complexity). encountering so many trade-off dilemmas, other tree data structure variants like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Radix Tree</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Suffix Tree</a>, <a href=""http://suggesttree.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Suggest Tree</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Merkle Tree</a> may come useful.</p>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence strategies</strong>:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Long short term memory</a> (LSTM )</strong> :</p>

<p><strong>Transformers</strong> :</p>
<p>The last but not least, I recommend <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Transformer</a> models. currently they are game changers. a great Transformer based language model is <a href=""https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google BERT</a>. it is highly promising on predicting future sequences.

Resolving this required removing the method: :index.</p>
<p>Other little errors and fixes were the usage of the <code>Workout.friendly.find(params[:id])</code> within the exercises_controller, however, params[:id] within this context would be the exercises_id not the workout_id.</p>

    new Golum(new ServiceLocator()).beNice(); // Fails!
}
</code></pre>

<p>This piece of code is the sublimation of all evil that comes with misuse of service locators. Main function is initializing the Golum class, but it has no clue what Golum requires. Golum just asks for a service locator, any service locator, and then gets going. When beNice method is invoked, it turns that particular service locator object that was passed has no knowledge of the Preciousss class at all, and then call to Locate fails.</p>

<p>Bottom line, negative consequences appear when a class doesn't declare its dependencies explicitly. And if you take a look at your case, this is not what happens there. Your class depends on SomeInterface and then asks for the resolver object which also knows of SomeInterface. I don't see negative consequences there.</p>

<p>When talking about naming, I might choose to call that ""locator"" object something like SomeInterfaceLookup, although SomeInterfaceLocator wouldn't be any worse than that.</p>
","This implementation is not a Factory or a Service Locator, as it doesn't create new instances or return distinct interfaces. It's a simple ""locator"" that returns objects implementing a single common interface.",,"This implementation is not the Factory because it doesn't create new instances. It isn't Service Locator either, because it is not locating services - now this requires a few words of explanation.

<p>This very sample code in my question is never meant to be a self-contained service/client code: It is a server-only app with <code>ZMQ_REP</code> socket.

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> use of <code>indexOf</code> in <strong>filterGender</strong> function</p>

<pre><code>const filteredGender = this.list.filter(
    user =&gt; user.gender.toLowerCase() === lowerCaseGender
);
</code></pre>

<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> You are filtering records from the <code>this.state.list</code> variable and then update it in same <code>state</code> variable.</p>

<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Use another variable <code>this.list</code> in <code>constructor</code> and use it to filter the records.</p>

<p>Define variable in <code>constructor</code></p>

<pre><code>constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      list: [],
      search: """"
    };
    this.list = []; // define new list here...
  }

<p>You have to assign upcoming list to <code>this.list</code> variable in <strong>getList</strong> function</p>

<pre><code>this.list = response.data.result;

      .then(response =&gt; {
        this.list = response.data.result; // assign list in variable
        this.setState({

      })
      .catch(err =&gt; {
        console.log(err);
      });

<p>Now you have to update both filter function as below. Instead of <code>this.state.list</code> use <code>this.list</code>.</p>

169420,Generic Java Framework to Manage Bidirectional Associations and Inverse Updates,"<p>Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism.  If your objects are JavaBeans, then you are looking at using PropertyChangeSupport and firing property change events.</p>

<p>If you do that (or have some other mechanism for detecting changes), then Glazed Lists provides an <a href=""http://publicobject.com/glazedlists/glazedlists-1.5.0/api/ca/odell/glazedlists/ObservableElementList.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ObservableElementList</a> that could easily be used to handle the association synchronization from the list end (i.e. adding A to List&lt; A> automatically calls a.setB(b)).  The other direction is easily handled using property change monitoring (or equivalent).</p>

<p>I realize that this isn't a generic solution, but it seems like it would be an easy foundation for one.</p>

<p>Note that something like this would <em>require</em> a special list implementation in the B class - no way short of AOP type solutions that you could handle it in the general case (i.e. using ArrayList or something like that).</p>

<p>I should also point out that what you are trying to achieve is something of the holy grail of data binding.  There are some decent implementations for binding at the field level (stuff like getters and setters) (see JGoodies binding and JSR 295 for examples).  There is also one really good implementation for list type binding (Glazed Lists, referred to above).  We use both techniques in concert with each other in almost all of our applications, but have never tried to go quite as abstract as what you are asking about.</p>

<p>If I were designing this, I would look at something like this:</p>

<pre><code>AssociationBuilder.createAssociation(A a, Connector&lt; A&gt; ca, B b,  Connector&lt; B&gt; cb, Synchronizer&lt; A,B&gt; sync)
</code></pre>

<p>Connector is an interface that allows for a single interface for various change notification types.  Synchronizer is an interface that is called to make sure both objects are in sync whenever one of them is changed.</p>

<pre><code>sync(ChangeInfo info, A a, B b) // make sure that b reflects current state of a and vice-versa.  
</code></pre>

<p>ChangeInfo provides data on which member changed, and what the changes actually were.  We are.  If you are trying to really keep this generic, then you pretty much have to punt the implementation of this up to the framework user.</p>

<p>With the above in place, it would be possible to have a number of pre-defined Connectors and Synchronizers that meet different binding criteria.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the above method signature is pretty similar to the JSR 295 createAutoBinding() method call.  Property objects are the equivalent of Connector.  JSR 295 doesn't have the Synchronizer (instead, they have a binding strategy specified as an ENUM - plus JSR 295 works only with property->property binding, trying to bind a field value of one object to that object's list membership in another object is not even on the table for them).</p>

","When opening a new window in JavaScript, provide the full URL to avoid relative paths, and be aware of potential redirects and limitations on content transfer between windows.",,"You should provide the full url when possible, else it tries to use the relative url. <code>var printWindow = window.open('', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> would open a blank url
<code>var printWindow = window.open('print.aspx', '', 'width=1000,height=700');</code> opens page <em>print.aspx</em> relative to current url. So if current url is <em>www.google.com</em>, it opens <em>www.google.com/print.aspx</em>, which would be 404 page not found.
