2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View). In some cases the model can also be used to turn a data source into a higher level abstraction as well. A good example of this is the MVC Storefront project. There is a discussion here regarding the differences between MVC vs MVP. The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view. Having said that, ASP.NET MVC is by these definitions an MVP framework because the Controller accesses the Model to populate the View which is meant to have no logic (just  displays the variables provided by the Controller). To perhaps get an idea of the ASP.NET MVC distinction from MVP, check out this MIX presentation by Scott Hanselman.","MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are frameworks that separate concerns into model, application logic, and display code. The key difference lies in the interaction between components: in MVC, the view and controller interact with the model but not each other, whereas in MVP, the presenter accesses the model and interacts with the view. However, some implementations, like ASP.NET MVC, blur this distinction, making it more similar to MVP.","Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View).

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Wikipedia Article. To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. Instead of your program explicitly controlling everything, your program sets up a class or library with certain functions to be called when certain things happen. It solves code duplication. For example, in the old days you would manually write your own event loop, polling the system libraries for new events. Nowadays, most modern APIs you simply tell the system libraries what events you're interested in, and it will let you know when they happen. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control. Inversion of control is made easy in many languages through the concept of delegates, interfaces, or even raw function pointers. It is not appropriate to use in all cases, because the flow of a program can be harder to follow when written this way. It's a useful way to design methods when writing a library that will be reused, but it should be used sparingly in the core of your own program unless it really solves a code duplication problem.","Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that transforms sequential code into a delegation structure, where a program sets up classes or libraries to handle specific events, reducing code duplication. It involves delegating control to external components, making it easier to manage events and reuse code, but should be used judiciously as it can make program flow harder to follow.","To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Inversion of Control is what you get when your program callbacks, e.g. like a gui program. For example, in an old school menu, you might have: thereby controlling the flow of user interaction. In a GUI program or somesuch, instead we say So now control is inverted... instead of the computer accepting user input in a fixed order, the user controls the order in which the data is entered, and when the data is saved in the database. Basically, anything with an event loop, callbacks, or execute triggers falls into this category.","Inversion of Control refers to a programming paradigm where the flow of control is reversed, allowing the user to dictate the order of events, rather than the program following a predetermined sequence.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"The Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) patterns are all about removing dependencies from your code. For example, say your application has a text editor component and you want to provide spell checking. Your standard code would look something like this: What we've done here creates a dependency between the <code>TextEditor</code> and the <code>SpellChecker</code>. In an IoC scenario we would instead do something like this: In the first code example we are instantiating <code>SpellChecker</code> (<code>this.checker = new SpellChecker();</code>), which means the <code>TextEditor</code> class directly depends on the <code>SpellChecker</code> class. In the second code example we are creating an abstraction by having the <code>SpellChecker</code> dependency class in <code>TextEditor</code> constructor signature (not initializing dependency in class). This allows us to call the dependency then pass it to the TextEditor class like so: Now the client creating the <code>TextEditor</code> class has the control over which <code>SpellChecker</code> implementation to use because we're injecting the dependency to the <code>TextEditor</code> signature. This is just a simple example, there's a good series of articles by Simone Busoli that explains it in greater detail.","Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that removes dependencies from code by decoupling objects. It achieves this through Dependency Injection (DI), where a dependent object is passed to a class rather than being instantiated within it, allowing the client to control which implementation to use.",The Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) patterns are all about removing dependencies from your code.,The Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) patterns are all about removing dependencies from your code.
9,How do I calculate someone's age in C#?,"This is the version we use here. It works, and it's fairly simple. It's the same idea as Jeff's but I think it's a little clearer because it separates out the logic for subtracting one, so it's a little easier to understand. You could expand the ternary operator to make it even clearer, if you think that sort of thing is unclear. Obviously this is done as an extension method on <code>DateTime</code>, but clearly you can grab that one line of code that does the work and put it anywhere. Here we have another overload of the Extension method that passes in <code>DateTime.Now</code>, just for completeness.","To calculate someone's age in C#, you can use an extension method on the `DateTime` class that subtracts the birth date from the current date, taking into account the current month and day to determine if the person has had their birthday this year.",,This is the version we use here.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"MVP: the view is in charge. The view, in most cases, creates its presenter. The presenter will interact with the model and manipulate the view through an interface. The view will sometimes interact with the presenter, usually through some interface. This comes down to implementation; do you want the view to call methods on the presenter or do you want the view to have events the presenter listens to? It boils down to this: The view knows about the presenter. The view delegates to the presenter. MVC: the controller is in charge. The controller is created or accessed based on some event/request. The controller then creates the appropriate view and interacts with the model to further configure the view. It boils down to: the controller creates and manages the view; the view is slave to the controller. The view does not know about the controller.","MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are two design patterns that differ in their approach to separating concerns. In MVP, the View is in charge and creates its Presenter, which interacts with the Model and updates the View.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Also worth remembering is that there are different types of MVPs as well. Fowler has broken the pattern into two - Passive View and Supervising Controller. When using Passive View, your View typically implement a fine-grained interface with properties mapping more or less directly to the underlaying UI widget. For instance, you might have a ICustomerView with properties like Name and Address. Your implementation might look something like this: Your Presenter class will talk to the model and ""map"" it to the view. This approach is called the ""Passive View"". The benefit is that the view is easy to test, and it is easier to move between UI platforms (Web, Windows/XAML, etc.). The disadvantage is that you can't leverage things like databinding (which is really powerful in frameworks like WPF and Silverlight). The second flavor of MVP is the Supervising Controller. In that case your View might have a property called Customer, which then again is databound to the UI widgets. You don't have to think about synchronizing and micro-manage the view, and the Supervising Controller can step in and help when needed, for instance with compled interaction logic. The third ""flavor"" of MVP (or someone would perhaps call it a separate pattern) is the Presentation Model (or sometimes referred to Model-View-ViewModel). Compared to the MVP you ""merge"" the M and the P into one class. You have your customer object which your UI widgets is data bound to, but you also have additional UI-spesific fields like ""IsButtonEnabled"", or ""IsReadOnly"", etc. I think the best resource I've found to UI architecture is the series of blog posts done by Jeremy Miller over at The Build Your Own CAB Series Table of Contents. He covered all the flavors of MVP and showed C# code to implement them. I have also blogged about the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in the context of Silverlight over at YouCard Re-visited: Implementing the ViewModel pattern.","The Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern has two main types: Passive View and Supervising Controller. Passive View uses a fine-grained interface to map the model to the view, making it easy to test and switch between UI platforms, but limiting the use of data binding. Supervising Controller uses data binding and allows the presenter to step in when needed. A third flavor, Presentation Model (or Model-View-ViewModel), merges the model and presenter into one class, adding UI-specific fields and using data binding.","The third ""flavor"" of MVP (or someone would perhaps call it a separate pattern) is the Presentation Model (or sometimes referred to Model-View-ViewModel).

For example, the Javadoc for <code>Map.containsKey</code> states: @throws NullPointerException if the key is null and this map     does not permit null keys (optional).

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"MVP is not necessarily a scenario where the View is in charge (see Taligent's MVP for example). I find it unfortunate that people are still preaching this as a pattern (View in charge) as opposed to an anti-pattern as it contradicts ""It's just a view"" (Pragmatic Programmer). ""It's just a view"" states that the final view shown to the user is a secondary concern of the application. Microsoft's MVP pattern renders re-use of Views much more difficult and conveniently excuses Microsoft's designer from encouraging bad practice. To be perfectly frank, I think the underlying concerns of MVC hold true for any MVP implementation and the differences are almost entirely semantic. As long as you are following separation of concerns between the view (that displays the data), the controller (that initialises and controls user interaction) and the model (the underlying data and/or services)) then you are acheiving the benefits of MVC. If you are acheiving the benefits then who really cares whether your pattern is MVC, MVP or Supervising Controller? The only real pattern remains as MVC, the rest are just differing flavours of it. Consider this highly exciting article that comprehensively lists a number of these differing implementations. You may note that they're all basically doing the same thing but slightly differently. I personally think MVP has only been recently re-introduced as a catchy term to either reduce arguments between semantic bigots who argue whether something is truly MVC or not or to justify Microsofts Rapid Application Development tools. Neither of these reasons in my books justify its existence as a separate design pattern.","The difference between MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) is largely semantic, with both patterns aiming to achieve separation of concerns between the view, controller/presenter, and model.

34510,What is a race condition?,"A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are ""racing"" to access/change the data. Problems often occur when one thread does a ""check-then-act"" (e.g. ""check"" if the value is X, then ""act"" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the ""check"" and the ""act"". E.g: The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing. In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time.

34510,What is a race condition?,"Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems. A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do. This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access. There's almost always a race condition when one thread calls sleep to give another thread time to finish a task (unless that sleep is in a loop, with some checking mechanism). Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals. Mutexes are good when you want to make sure you're the only one doing something. Signals are good when you want to make sure someone else has finished doing something. Minimizing shared resources can also help prevent unexpected behaviors Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs. Code which relies heavily on sleeps is prone to race conditions, so first check for calls to sleep in the affected code. Adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events. This can be useful for reproducing the behavior, seeing if you can make it disappear by changing the timing of things, and for testing solutions put in place. The sleeps should be removed after debugging. The signature sign that one has a race condition though, is if there's an issue that only occurs intermittently on some machines. Common bugs would be crashes and deadlocks. With logging, you should be able to find the affected area and work back from there.","A race condition occurs in multi-threaded or multi-process systems when the order of events is assumed without ensuring they happen in that order, often when sharing resources.

34510,What is a race condition?,"A ""race condition"" exists when multithreaded (or otherwise parallel) code that would access a shared resource could do so in such a way as to cause unexpected results. Take this example: If you had 5 threads executing this code at once, the value of x WOULD NOT end up being 50,000,000. It would in fact vary with each run. This is because, in order for each thread to increment the value of x, they have to do the following: (simplified, obviously) Any thread can be at any step in this process at any time, and they can step on each other when a shared resource is involved. The state of x can be changed by another thread during the time between x is being read and when it is written back. Let's say a thread retrieves the value of x, but hasn't stored it yet. Another thread can also retrieve the same value of x (because no thread has changed it yet) and then they would both be storing the same value (x+1) back in x!

If you have code that reflects on a class and extracts a method by name (eg: with <code>Class.getDeclaredMethod(""someMethodName"", .....)</code>) then any time that method name changes, such as during a refactor, you will need to remember to update the parameters to the reflection method to match the new method signature, or the <code>getDeclaredMethod</code> call will throw a <code>NoSuchMethodException</code>. If this is the reason, then the stack trace should show the point that the reflection method is invoked, and you'll just need to update the parameters to match the actual method signature.

When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value. Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading. Third, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead? Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE's separately from IAE and do something different as a result? Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message? But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters. Fourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent? Why is it that an illegal <code>null</code> is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments? Finally, I accept the argument given by other answers that parts of the Java API use NPE in this manner. However, the Java API is inconsistent with everything from exception types to naming conventions, so I think just blindly copying (your favorite part of) the Java API isn't a good enough argument to trump these other considerations.","When a method receives a null parameter, it's recommended to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` (IAE) instead of a `NullPointerException` (NPE) because IAE is designed for validating parameters, provides a clear indication of the error, and maintains consistency with other invalid parameter handling.","You should be using <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> (IAE), not <code>NullPointerException</code> (NPE) for the following reasons:","You should be using <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> (IAE), not <code>NullPointerException</code> (NPE) for the following reasons:"

62814,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"The answer may depend on the target OS. For example, at least one RTOS implementation I'm familiar with will allow multiple sequential ""get"" operations against a single OS mutex, so long as they're all from within the same thread context. The multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex. This differs from binary semaphores, for which only a single get is allowed at a time, regardless of thread contexts. The idea behind this type of mutex is that you protect an object by only allowing a single context to modify the data at a time. Even if the thread gets the mutex and then calls a function that further modifies the object (and gets/puts the protector mutex around its own operations), the operations should still be safe because they're all happening under a single thread. Of course, when using this feature, you must be certain that all accesses within a single thread really are safe! I'm not sure how common this approach is, or whether it applies outside of the systems with which I'm familiar. For an example of this kind of mutex, see the ThreadX RTOS.","The key difference between a binary semaphore and a mutex is that a mutex can allow multiple sequential ""get"" operations from the same thread context, whereas a binary semaphore only allows a single ""get"" at a time, regardless of thread context.

75191,What is an unsigned char?,"As for example usages of unsigned char: unsigend char is often used in computer graphics which very often (though not always) assigns a single byte to each colour component. It is common to see an RGB (or RGBA) colour represented as 24 (or 32) bits, each an unsigned char. Since unsigned char values fall in the range [0,255], the values are typically interpreted as 0 meaning a total lack of a given colour component 255 meaning 100% of a given colour pigment So you would end up with RGB red as (255,0,0) -> (100% red, 0% green, 0% blue). Why not use a signed char? Arithmetic and bit shifting becomes problematic. As explained already, a signed char's range is essentially shifted by -128. A very simple and naive (mostly unused) method for converting RGB to grayscale is to average all three colour components, but this runs into problems when the values of the colour components are negative. Red (255, 0, 0) averages to (85, 85, 85) when using unsigned char arithmetic. However, if the values were signed chars (127,-128,-128), we would end up with (-99, -99, -99), which would be (29, 29, 29) in our unsigned char space, which is incorrect.","An unsigned char is an 8-bit data type with values ranging from 0 to 255, commonly used in computer graphics to represent color components, such as RGB, where 0 represents the absence of a color and 255 represents 100% of that color.

62814,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"They are NOT the same thing. They are used for different purposes! While both types of semaphores have a full/empty state and use the same API, their usage is very different. Mutual Exclusion Semaphores Mutual Exclusion semaphores are used to protect shared resources (data structure, file, etc..). A Mutex semaphore is ""owned"" by the task that takes it. If Task B attempts to semGive a mutex currently held by Task A, Task B's call will return an error and fail. Mutexes always use the following sequence: Here is a simple example: Binary Semaphore Binary Semaphore address a totally different question: Task B is pended waiting for something to happen (a sensor being tripped for example). Sensor Trips and an Interrupt Service Routine runs. It needs to notify a task of the trip. Task B should run and take appropriate actions for the sensor trip. Then go back to waiting. Note that with a binary semaphore, it is OK for B to take the semaphore and A to give it. Again, a binary semaphore is NOT protecting a resource from access. The act of Giving and Taking a semaphore are fundamentally decoupled. It typically makes little sense for the same task to so a give and a take on the same binary semaphore.","Here is a brief and accurate summary:

The key difference between a binary semaphore and a mutex is their purpose. A mutex (mutual exclusion semaphore) is used to protect shared resources and is ""owned"" by the task that takes it, whereas a binary semaphore is used to signal events between tasks and does not imply ownership, allowing one task to give and another to take the semaphore.","They are NOT the same thing.

86049,How do I ignore files in Subversion?,"(This answer has been updated to match SVN 1.8 and 1.9's behaviour) You have 2 questions: Marking files as ignored: By ""ignored file"" I mean the file won't appear in lists even as ""unversioned"": your SVN client will pretend the file doesn't exist at all in the filesystem. Ignored files are specified by a ""file pattern"". The syntax and format of file patterns is explained in SVN's online documentation: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.special.ignore.html ""File Patterns in Subversion"". Subversion, as of version 1.8 (June 2013) and later, supports 3 different ways of specifying file patterns. Here's a summary with examples: 1 - Runtime Configuration Area - <code>global-ignores</code> option: This is a client-side only setting, so your <code>global-ignores</code> list won't be shared by other users, and it applies to all repos you checkout onto your computer. This setting is defined in your Runtime Configuration Area file: Windows (file-based) - <code>C:\Users\{you}\AppData\Roaming\Subversion\config</code> Windows (registry-based) - <code>Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\global-ignores</code> in both <code>HKLM</code> and <code>HKCU</code>. Linux/Unix - <code>~/.subversion/config</code> 2 - The <code>svn:ignore</code> property, which is set on directories (not files): This is stored within the repo, so other users will have the same ignore files. Similar to how <code>.gitignore</code> works. <code>svn:ignore</code> is applied to directories and is non-recursive or inherited. Any file or immediate subdirectory of the parent directory that matches the File Pattern will be excluded. While SVN 1.8 adds the concept of ""inherited properties"", the <code>svn:ignore</code> property itself is ignored in non-immediate descendant directories: (So the file <code>./subdirectory/ignoreThis</code> is not ignored, even though ""<code>ignoreThis.txt</code>"" is applied on the <code>.</code> repo root). Therefore, to apply an ignore list recursively you must use <code>svn propset svn:ignore &lt;filePattern&gt; . --recursive</code>. This will create a copy of the property on every subdirectory. If the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> value is different in a child directory then the child's value completely overrides the parents, so there is no ""additive"" effect. So if you change the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> on the root <code>.</code>, then you must change it with <code>--recursive</code> to overwrite it on the child and descendant directories. I note that the command-line syntax is counter-intuitive. I started-off assuming that you would ignore a file in SVN by typing something like <code>svn ignore pathToFileToIgnore.txt</code> however this is not how SVN's ignore feature works. 3- The <code>svn:global-ignores</code> property. Requires SVN 1.8 (June 2013): This is similar to <code>svn:ignore</code>, except it makes use of SVN 1.8's ""inherited properties"" feature. Compare to <code>svn:ignore</code>, the file pattern is automatically applied in every descendant directory (not just immediate children). This means that is unnecessary to set <code>svn:global-ignores</code> with the <code>--recursive</code> flag, as inherited ignore file patterns are automatically applied as they're inherited. Running the same set of commands as in the previous example, but using <code>svn:global-ignores</code> instead: For TortoiseSVN users: This whole arrangement was confusing for me, because TortoiseSVN's terminology (as used in their Windows Explorer menu system) was initially misleading to me - I was unsure what the significance of the Ignore menu's ""Add  recursively"", ""Add *"" and ""Add "" options. I hope this post explains how the Ignore feature ties-in to the SVN Properties feature. That said, I suggest using the command-line to set ignored files so you get a feel for how it works instead of using the GUI, and only using the GUI to manipulate properties after you're comfortable with the command-line. Listing files that are ignored: The command <code>svn status</code> will hide ignored files (that is, files that match an RGA <code>global-ignores</code> pattern, or match an immediate parent directory's <code>svn:ignore</code> pattern or match any ancesor directory's <code>svn:global-ignores</code> pattern. Use the <code>--no-ignore</code> option to see those files listed. Ignored files have a status of <code>I</code>, then pipe the output to <code>grep</code> to only show lines starting with ""I"". The command is: For example: ta-da!","To ignore files in Subversion, you can use one of three methods: 

1. **Runtime Configuration Area**: Set the `global-ignores` option in your client-side configuration file, which applies to all repositories on your computer.
2. **svn:ignore property**: Set this property on directories to ignore files, which is stored in the repository and applies to all users. This property is non-recursive, but can be applied recursively using the `--recursive` flag.
3. **svn:global-ignores property**: Similar to `svn:ignore`, but automatically applies to all descendant directories due to SVN 1.","Marking files as ignored: This setting is defined in your Runtime Configuration Area file: <code>svn:ignore</code> is applied to directories and is non-recursive or inherited.

93539,What is the difference between Views and Materialized Views in Oracle?,"Views evaluate the data in the tables underlying the view definition at the time the view is queried. It is a logical view of your tables, with no data stored anywhere else. The upside of a view is that it will always return the latest data to you. The downside of a view is that its performance depends on how good a select statement the view is based on. If the select statement used by the view joins many tables, or uses joins based on non-indexed columns, the view could perform poorly. Materialized views are similar to regular views, in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement), however, the underlying query resultset has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view, you are querying a table, which may also be indexed. In addition, because all the joins have been resolved at materialized view refresh time, you pay the price of the join once (or as often as you refresh your materialized view), rather than each time you select from the materialized view. In addition, with query rewrite enabled, Oracle can optimize a query that selects from the source of your materialized view in such a way that it instead reads from your materialized view. In situations where you create materialized views as forms of aggregate tables, or as copies of frequently executed queries, this can greatly speed up the response time of your end user application. The downside though is that the data you get back from the materialized view is only as up to date as the last time the materialized view has been refreshed. Materialized views can be set to refresh manually, on a set schedule, or based on the database detecting a change in data from one of the underlying tables. Materialized views can be incrementally updated by combining them with materialized view logs, which act as change data capture sources on the underlying tables. Materialized views are most often used in data warehousing / business intelligence applications where querying large fact tables with thousands of millions of rows would result in query response times that resulted in an unusable application.","**Summary:** In Oracle, the key difference between Views and Materialized Views is how they store and retrieve data.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"So number 1 above. What is Inversion of Control? Maintenance is the number one thing it solves for me. It guarantees I am using interfaces so that two classes are not intimate with each other. In using a container like Castle Windsor, it solves maintenance issues even better. Being able to swap out a component that goes to a database for one that uses file based persistence without changing a line of code is awesome (configuration change, you're done). And once you get into generics, it gets even better. Imagine having a message publisher that receives records and publishes messages. It doesn't care what it publishes, but it needs a mapper to take something from a record to a message. I wrote it once, but now I can inject many types into this set of code if I publish different types of messages. I can also write mappers that take a record of the same type and map them to different messages. Using DI with Generics has given me the ability to write very little code to accomplish many tasks.

Note that the magic behaviour that 'Initalised' gains by having the metaclass <code>init_attributes</code> is not passed onto a subclass of Initalised.

It can be easily seen that in Python classes need to be first-class objects too to enable this behavior. I've never written one myself, but I think one of the nicest uses of metaclasses can be seen in the Django framework.

100003,What are metaclasses in Python?,"A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves, a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows), the more useful approach is actually to make it an actual class itself. <code>type</code> is the usual metaclass in Python. In case you're wondering, yes, <code>type</code> is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won't be able to recreate something like <code>type</code> purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass <code>type</code>. A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. Like you create an instance of the class by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the 'class' statement) by calling the metaclass. Combined with the normal <code>__init__</code> and <code>__new__</code> methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to do 'extra things' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry, or even replace the class with something else entirely. When the <code>class</code> statement is executed, Python first executes the body of the <code>class</code> statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the <code>__metaclass__</code> attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the <code>__metaclass__</code> global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name, bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it. However, metaclasses actually define the <em>type</em> of a class, not just a factory for it, so you can do much more with them. You can, for instance, define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods, in that they can be called on the class without an instance, but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. <code>type.__subclasses__()</code> is an example of a method on the <code>type</code> metaclass. You can also define the normal 'magic' methods, like <code>__add__</code>, <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__getattr__</code>, to implement or change how the class behaves. Here's an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:","**Metaclasses in Python**: A metaclass is a class that defines the behavior of another class. It's a class factory that allows you to customize the creation and behavior of classes. In Python, `type` is the default metaclass, and you can create your own metaclasses by subclassing `type`.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Model-View-Presenter In MVP, the Presenter contains the UI business logic for the View. All invocations from the View delegate directly to Presenter. The Presenter is also decoupled directly from the View and talks to it through an interface. This is to allow mocking of the View in a unit test. One common attribute of MVP is that there has to be a lot of two-way dispatching. For example, when someone clicks the ""Save"" button, the event handler delegates to the Presenter's ""OnSave"" method. Once the save is completed, the Presenter will then call back the View through its interface so that the View can display that the save has completed. MVP tends to be a very natural pattern for achieving separated presentation in Web Forms. The reason is that the View is always created first by the ASP.NET runtime. You can find out more about both variants. Two primary variations Passive View: The View is as dumb as possible and contains almost zero logic. The Presenter is a middle man that talks to the View and the Model. The View and Model are completely shielded from one another. The Model may raise events, but the Presenter subscribes to them for updating the View. In Passive View there is no direct data binding, instead the View exposes setter properties which the Presenter uses to set the data. All state is managed in the Presenter and not the View. Pro: maximum testability surface; clean separation of the View and Model Con: more work (for example all the setter properties) as you are doing all the data binding yourself. Supervising Controller: The Presenter handles user gestures. The View binds to the Model directly through data binding. In this case it's the Presenter's job to pass off the Model to the View so that it can bind to it. The Presenter will also contain logic for gestures like pressing a button, navigation, etc. Pro: by leveraging databinding the amount of code is reduced. Con: there's less testable surface (because of data binding), and there's less encapsulation in the View since it talks directly to the Model. Model-View-Controller In the MVC, the Controller is responsible for determining which View to display in response to any action including when the application loads. This differs from MVP where actions route through the View to the Presenter. In MVC, every action in the View correlates with a call to a Controller along with an action. In the web each action involves a call to a URL on the other side of which there is a Controller who responds. Once that Controller has completed its processing, it will return the correct View. The sequence continues in that manner throughout the life of the application: One other big difference about MVC is that the View does not directly bind to the Model. The view simply renders, and is completely stateless. In implementations of MVC the View usually will not have any logic in the code behind. This is contrary to MVP where it is absolutely necessary because, if the View does not delegate to the Presenter, it will never get called. Presentation Model One other pattern to look at is the Presentation Model pattern. In this pattern there is no Presenter. Instead the View binds directly to a Presentation Model. The Presentation Model is a Model crafted specifically for the View. This means this Model can expose properties that one would never put on a domain model as it would be a violation of separation-of-concerns. In this case, the Presentation Model binds to the domain model, and may subscribe to events coming from that Model. The View then subscribes to events coming from the Presentation Model and updates itself accordingly. The Presentation Model can expose commands which the view uses for invoking actions. The advantage of this approach is that you can essentially remove the code-behind altogether as the PM completely encapsulates all of the behaviour for the view. This pattern is a very strong candidate for use in WPF applications and is also called Model-View-ViewModel. There is a MSDN article about the Presentation Model and a section in the Composite Application Guidance for WPF (former Prism) about Separated Presentation Patterns","Here is a brief and accurate summary:

MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) are two software patterns used for separating presentation logic. In MVP, the Presenter contains UI business logic and acts as an intermediary between the View and Model. In MVC, the Controller determines which View to display in response to user actions. Key differences between MVP and MVC include the role of the View, data binding, and testability. Additionally, variations of MVP include Passive View and Supervising Controller, while the Presentation Model pattern eliminates the need for a Presenter, allowing the View to bind directly to a Presentation Model.","Model-View-Presenter In MVP, the Presenter contains the UI business logic for the View.

These additional features are intended   to reduce bugs caused by the misuse of   pointers while retaining efficiency.   Smart pointers typically keep track of   the objects that point to them for the   purpose of memory management. The   misuse of pointers is a major source   of bugs: the constant allocation,   deallocation and referencing that must   be performed by a program written   using pointers makes it very likely   that some memory leaks will occur.

106508,What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?,"A smart pointer is a class that wraps a 'raw' (or 'bare') C++ pointer, to manage the lifetime of the object being pointed to. There is no single smart pointer type, but all of them try to abstract a raw pointer in a practical way. Smart pointers should be preferred over raw pointers. If you feel you need to use pointers (first consider if you really do), you would normally want to use a smart pointer as this can alleviate many of the problems with raw pointers, mainly forgetting to delete the object and leaking memory. With raw pointers, the programmer has to explicitly destroy the object when it is no longer useful. A smart pointer by comparison defines a policy as to when the object is destroyed. You still have to create the object, but you no longer have to worry about destroying it. The simplest policy in use involves the scope of the smart pointer wrapper object, such as implemented by <code>boost::scoped_ptr</code> or <code>std::unique_ptr</code>. Note that <code>scoped_ptr</code> instances cannot be copied. This prevents the pointer from being deleted multiple times (incorrectly). You can, however, pass references to it around to other functions you call. Scoped pointers are useful when you want to tie the lifetime of the object to a particular block of code, or if you embedded it as member data inside another object, the lifetime of that other object. The object exists until the containing block of code is exited, or until the containing object is itself destroyed. A more complex smart pointer policy involves reference counting the pointer. This does allow the pointer to be copied. When the last ""reference"" to the object is destroyed, the object is deleted. This policy is implemented by <code>boost::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code>. Reference counted pointers are very useful when the lifetime of your object is much more complicated, and is not tied directly to a particular section of code or to another object. There is one drawback to reference counted pointers Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?the possibility of creating a dangling reference: Another possibility is creating circular references: To work around this problem, both Boost and C++11 have defined a <code>weak_ptr</code> to define a weak (uncounted) reference to a <code>shared_ptr</code>.

109023,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"This is known as the 'Hamming Weight', 'popcount' or 'sideways addition'. The 'best' algorithm really depends on which CPU you are on and what your usage pattern is. Some CPUs have a single built-in instruction to do it and others have parallel instructions which act on bit vectors. The parallel instructions (like x86's <code>popcnt</code>, on CPUs where it's supported) will almost certainly be fastest. Some other architectures may have a slow instruction implemented with a microcoded loop that tests a bit per cycle (citation needed). A pre-populated table lookup method can be very fast if your CPU has a large cache and/or you are doing lots of these instructions in a tight loop. However it can suffer because of the expense of a 'cache miss', where the CPU has to fetch some of the table from main memory. If you know that your bytes will be mostly 0's or mostly 1's then there are very efficient algorithms for these scenarios. I believe a very good general purpose algorithm is the following, known as 'parallel' or 'variable-precision SWAR algorithm'. I have expressed this in a C-like pseudo language, you may need to adjust it to work for a particular language (e.g. using uint32_t for C++ and >>> in Java): This has the best worst-case behaviour of any of the algorithms discussed, so will efficiently deal with any usage pattern or values you throw at it. This bitwise-SWAR algorithm could parallelize to be done in multiple vector elements at once, instead of in a single integer register, for a speedup on CPUs with SIMD but no usable popcount instruction. (e.g. x86-64 code that has to run on any CPU, not just Nehalem or later.) However, the best way to use vector instructions for popcount is usually by using a variable-shuffle to do a table-lookup for 4 bits at a time of each byte in parallel. (The 4 bits index a 16 entry table held in a vector register). On Intel CPUs, the hardware 64bit popcnt instruction can outperform an SSSE3 <code>PSHUFB</code> bit-parallel implementation by about a factor of 2, but only if your compiler gets it just right. Otherwise SSE can come out significantly ahead. Newer compiler versions are aware of the popcnt false dependency problem on Intel.

109023,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"Also consider the built-in functions of your compilers. On the GNU compiler for example you can just use: In the worst case the compiler will generate a call to a function. In the best case the compiler will emit a cpu instruction to do the same job faster. The GCC intrinsics even work across multiple platforms. Popcount will become mainstream in the x86 architecture, so it makes sense to start using the intrinsic now. Other architectures have the popcount for years. On x86, you can tell the compiler that it can assume support for <code>popcnt</code> instruction with <code>-mpopcnt</code> or <code>-msse4.2</code> to also enable the vector instructions that were added in the same generation. See GCC x86 options. <code>-march=nehalem</code> (or <code>-march=</code> whatever CPU you want your code to assume and to tune for) could be a good choice. Running the resulting binary on an older CPU will result in an illegal-instruction fault. To make binaries optimized for the machine you build them on, use <code>-march=native</code>  (with gcc, clang, or ICC). MSVC provides an intrinsic for the x86 <code>popcnt</code> instruction, but unlike gcc it's really an intrinsic for the hardware instruction and requires hardware support. Using <code>std::bitset&lt;&gt;::count()</code> instead of a built-in In theory, any compiler that knows how to popcount efficiently for the target CPU should expose that functionality through ISO C++ <code>std::bitset&lt;&gt;</code>. In practice, you might be better off with the bit-hack AND/shift/ADD in some cases for some target CPUs. For target architectures where hardware popcount is an optional extension (like x86), not all compilers have a <code>std::bitset</code> that takes advantage of it when available. For example, MSVC has no way to enable <code>popcnt</code> support at compile time, and always uses a table lookup, even with <code>/Ox /arch:AVX</code> (which implies SSE4.2, although technically there is a separate feature bit for <code>popcnt</code>.) But at least you get something portable that works everywhere, and with gcc/clang with the right target options, you get hardware popcount for architectures that support it. See asm from gcc, clang, icc, and MSVC on the Godbolt compiler explorer. x86-64 <code>gcc -O3 -std=gnu++11 -mpopcnt</code> emits this: PowerPC64 <code>gcc -O3 -std=gnu++11</code> emits (for the <code>int</code> arg version): This source isn't x86-specific or GNU-specific at all, but only compiles well for x86 with gcc/clang/icc. Also note that gcc's fallback for architectures without single-instruction popcount is a byte-at-a-time table lookup. This isn't wonderful for ARM, for example.","To count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer, consider using built-in compiler functions or intrinsics, such as GCC's `__builtin_popcount` or MSVC's `__popcnt`, which can emit a CPU instruction for efficient counting.

If <code>T</code> were <code>User</code> and <code>AuthorizedUserPredicate&lt;User&gt;</code> implements <code>IPredicate&lt;T&gt;</code>, then <code>AuthorizedUserPredicate#apply</code> returns whether the passed in <code>User</code> is authorized.

This strategy is most applicable to high-volume systems and three-tier architectures where you do not necessarily maintain a connection to the database for your session. In this situation the client cannot actually maintain database locks as the connections are taken from a pool and you may not be using the same connection from one access to the next. Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it. It has much better integrity than optimistic locking but requires you to be careful with your application design to avoid Deadlocks. To use pessimistic locking you need either a direct connection to the database (as would typically be the case in a two tier client server application) or an externally available transaction ID that can be used independently of the connection. In the latter case you open the transaction with the TxID and then reconnect using that ID. The DBMS maintains the locks and allows you to pick the session back up through the TxID. This is how distributed transactions using two-phase commit protocols (such as XA or COM+ Transactions) work.","**Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Locking:**

* **Optimistic Locking:** Checks for version changes before updating a record, aborts if changes are detected, and is suitable for high-volume systems and three-tier architectures.
* **Pessimistic Locking:** Locks a record exclusively until finished, provides better integrity, but requires careful design to avoid deadlocks and a direct database connection or external transaction ID.",Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it. It has much better integrity than optimistic locking but requires you to be careful with your application design to avoid Deadlocks.,"Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, take note of a version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or checksums/hashes) and check that the version hasn't changed before you write the record back.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"Paraphrased from Brian Button: They are generally used as a global instance, why is that so bad? Because you hide the dependencies of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces. Making something global to avoid passing it around is a code smell. They violate the single responsibility principle: by virtue of the fact that they control their own creation and lifecycle. They inherently cause code to be tightly coupled. This makes faking them out under test rather difficult in many cases. They carry state around for the lifetime of the application. Another hit to testing since you can end up with a situation where tests need to be ordered which is a big no no for unit tests. Why? Because each unit test should be independent from the other.","Singletons are considered bad practice because they hide dependencies, violate the single responsibility principle, cause tight coupling, and make testing difficult due to their global state, leading to tightly coupled and hard-to-test code.",,"Because you hide the dependencies of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,The singleton pattern is not a problem in itself. The problem is that the pattern is often used by people developing software with object-oriented tools without having a solid grasp of OO concepts.

141525,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"Let's say we have a single byte: Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte. The bits don't rollover; they are discarded. That means if you left shift 1101100 and then right shift it, you won't get the same result back. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N. Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2N and rounding to zero. Bitshifting can be used for insanely fast multiplication and division, provided you are working with a power of 2. Almost all low-level graphics routines use bitshifting. For example, way back in the olden days, we used mode 13h (320x200 256 colors) for games. In Mode 13h, the video memory was laid out sequentially per pixel. That meant to calculate the location for a pixel, you would use the following math: Now, back in that day and age, speed was critical, so we would use bitshifts to do this operation. However, 320 is not a power of two, so to get around this we have to find out what is a power of two that added together makes 320: Now we can convert that into left shifts: For a final result of: Now we get the same offset as before, except instead of an expensive multiplication operation, we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this (note, it's been forever since I've done assembly (editor's note: corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example)): Total: 28 cycles on whatever ancient CPU had these timings. Vrs 12 cycles on the same ancient CPU. Yes, we would work this hard to shave off 16 CPU cycles. In 32 or 64-bit mode, both versions get a lot shorter and faster. Modern out-of-order execution CPUs like Intel Skylake (see http://agner.org/optimize/) have very fast hardware multiply (low latency and high throughput), so the gain is much smaller. AMD Bulldozer-family is a bit slower, especially for 64-bit multiply. On Intel CPUs, and AMD Ryzen, two shifts are slightly lower latency but more instructions than a multiply (which may lead to lower throughput): vs. Compilers will do this for you: See how gcc, clang, and MSVC all use shift+lea when optimizing <code>return 320*row + col;</code>. The most interesting thing to note here is that x86 has a shift-and-add instruction (<code>LEA</code>) that can do small left shifts and add at the same time, with the performance as and <code>add</code> instruction. ARM is even more powerful: one operand of any instruction can be left or right shifted for free. So scaling by a compile-time-constant that's known to be a power-of-2 can be even more efficient than a multiply. OK, back in the modern days... something more useful now would be to use bitshifting to store two 8-bit values in a 16-bit integer. For example, in C#: In C++, compilers should do this for you if you used a <code>struct</code> with two 8-bit members, but in practice don't always.","Bitwise shift operators shift the bits of a number left or right, effectively multiplying or dividing by a power of 2. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2^N, while shifting right by N is equivalent to dividing by 2^N and rounding to zero. This operation is useful for fast multiplication and division, especially in low-level graphics routines and when working with powers of 2. Compilers can often optimize multiplication by a constant into bitshifts, and some architectures, like x86 and ARM, have instructions that combine shifts and additions, making bitshifting a efficient way to perform certain operations.",,"Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte.

141525,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"The bit shifting operators do exactly what their name implies. They shift bits. Here's a brief (or not-so-brief) introduction to the different shift operators. The Operators <li><code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the left shift operator, and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts. All of these operators can be applied to integer values (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, possibly <code>short</code> and <code>byte</code> or <code>char</code>). In some languages, applying the shift operators to any datatype smaller than <code>int</code> automatically resizes the operand to be an <code>int</code>. Note that <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> is not an operator, because it would be redundant. Also note that C and C++ do not distinguish between the right shift operators. They provide only the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator, and the right-shifting behavior is implementation defined for signed types. Left shift (&lt;&lt;) Integers are stored, in memory, as a series of bits. For example, the number 6 stored as a 32-bit <code>int</code> would be: Shifting this bit pattern to the left one position (<code>6 &lt;&lt; 1</code>) would result in the number 12: As you can see, the digits have shifted to the left by one position, and the last digit on the right is filled with a zero. You might also note that shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2. So <code>6 &lt;&lt; 1</code> is equivalent to <code>6 * 2</code>, and <code>6 &lt;&lt; 3</code> is equivalent to <code>6 * 8</code>. A good optimizing compiler will replace multiplications with shifts when possible. Non-circular shifting Please note that these are <em>not</em> circular shifts. Shifting this value to the left by one position (<code>3,758,096,384 &lt;&lt; 1</code>): results in 3,221,225,472: The digit that gets shifted ""off the end"" is lost. It does not wrap around. Logical right shift (>>>) A logical right shift is the converse to the left shift. Rather than moving bits to the left, they simply move to the right. For example, shifting the number 12: to the right by one position (<code>12 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1</code>) will get back our original 6: So we see that shifting to the right is equivalent to division by powers of 2. Lost bits are gone However, a shift cannot reclaim ""lost"" bits. For example, if we shift this pattern: to the left 4 positions (<code>939,524,102 &lt;&lt; 4</code>), we get 2,147,483,744: and then shifting back (<code>(939,524,102 &lt;&lt; 4) &gt;&gt;&gt; 4</code>) we get 134,217,734: We cannot get back our original value once we have lost bits. Arithmetic right shift (>>) The arithmetic right shift is exactly like the logical right shift, except instead of padding with zero, it pads with the most significant bit. This is because the most significant bit is the <em>sign</em> bit, or the bit that distinguishes positive and negative numbers. By padding with the most significant bit, the arithmetic right shift is sign-preserving. For example, if we interpret this bit pattern as a negative number: we have the number -2,147,483,552. Shifting this to the right 4 positions with the arithmetic shift (-2,147,483,552 >> 4) would give us: or the number -134,217,722. So we see that we have preserved the sign of our negative numbers by using the arithmetic right shift, rather than the logical right shift. And once again, we see that we are performing division by powers of 2.","Bitwise shift operators shift the bits of an integer value, with three types: left shift (`<<`), arithmetic (signed) right shift (`>>`), and logical (unsigned) right shift (`>>>`). The left shift operator shifts bits to the left, filling the rightmost bit with zero, equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2. The arithmetic right shift operator shifts bits to the right, padding with the most significant bit (sign bit), preserving the sign of negative numbers, and is equivalent to division by powers of 2. The logical right shift operator also shifts bits to the right, but pads with zero, and is equivalent","They shift bits.

141525,What are bitwise shift (bit-shift) operators and how do they work?,"Bitwise operations, including bit shift, are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming. If you read a specification for a device or even some binary file formats, you will see bytes, words, and dwords, broken up into non-byte aligned bitfields, which contain various values of interest. Accessing these bit-fields for reading/writing is the most common usage. A simple real example in graphics programming is that a 16-bit pixel is represented as follows: To get at the green value you would do this: <strong>Explanation</strong> In order to obtain the value of green ONLY, which starts at offset 5 and ends at 10 (i.e. 6-bits long), you need to use a (bit) mask, which when applied against the entire 16-bit pixel, will yield only the bits we are interested in. The appropriate mask is 0x7E0 which in binary is 0000011111100000 (which is 2016 in decimal). To apply a mask, you use the AND operator (&amp;). After applying the mask, you'll end up with a 16-bit number which is really just a 11-bit number since its MSB is in the 11th bit. Green is actually only 6-bits long, so we need to scale it down using a right shift (11 - 6 = 5), hence the use of 5 as offset (<code>#define GREEN_OFFSET  5</code>). Also common is using bit shifts for fast multiplication and division by powers of 2:","Bitwise shift operators are used to manipulate bits in a binary number. They are essential in low-level programming, such as accessing non-byte aligned bitfields in device specifications or binary file formats. A common use case is extracting specific values from a binary representation, like getting the green value from a 16-bit pixel.

146452,What are POD types in C++?,"Very informally: A POD is a type (including classes) where the C++ compiler guarantees that there will be no ""magic"" going on in the structure: for example hidden pointers to vtables, offsets that get applied to the address when it is cast to other types (at least if the target's POD too), constructors, or destructors. Roughly speaking, a type is a POD when the only things in it are built-in types and combinations of them. The result is something that ""acts like"" a C type. Less informally: <li><code>int</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>wchar_t</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code> are PODs, as are <code>long/short</code> and <code>signed/unsigned</code> versions of them. <li>pointers (including pointer-to-function and pointer-to-member) are PODs, <li><code>enums</code> are PODs <li>a <code>const</code> or <code>volatile</code> POD is a POD. <li>a <code>class</code>, <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> of PODs is a POD provided that all non-static data members are <code>public</code>, and it has no base class and no constructors, destructors, or virtual methods. Static members don't stop something being a POD under this rule. <li>Wikipedia is wrong to say that a POD cannot have members of type pointer-to-member.

148747,What is the difference between a framework and a library?,"Actually these terms can mean a lot of different things depending the context they are used. For example, on Mac OS X frameworks are just libraries, packed into a bundle. Within the bundle you will find an actual dynamic library (libWhatever.dylib). The difference between a bare library and the framework on Mac is that a framework can contain multiple different versions of the library. It can contain extra resources (images, localized strings, XML data files, UI objects, etc.) and unless the framework is released to public, it usually contains the necessary .h files you need to use the library. Thus you have everything within a single package you need to use the library in your application (a C/C++/Objective-C library without .h files is pretty useless, unless you write them yourself according to some library documentation), instead of a bunch of files to move around (a Mac bundle is just a directory on the Unix level, but the UI treats it like a single file, pretty much like you have JAR files in Java and when you click it, you usually don't see what's inside, unless you explicitly select to show the content). Wikipedia calls framework a ""buzzword"". It defines a software framework as A software framework is a re-usable  design for a software system (or  subsystem). A software framework may  include support programs, code  libraries, a scripting language, or  other software to help develop and  glue together the different components  of a software project. Various parts  of the framework may be exposed  through an API.. So I'd say a library is just that, ""a library"". It is a collection of objects/functions/methods (depending on your language) and your application ""links"" against it and thus can use the objects/functions/methods. It is basically a file containing re-usable code that can usually be shared among multiple applications (you don't have to write the same code over and over again). A framework can be everything you use in application development. It can be a library, a collection of many libraries, a collection of scripts, or any piece of software you need to create your application. Framework is just a very vague term. Here's an article about some guy regarding the topic ""Library vs. Framework"". I personally think this article is highly arguable. It's not wrong what he's saying there, however, he's just picking out one of the multiple definitions of framework and compares that to the classic definition of library. E.g. he says you need a framework for sub-classing. Really? I can have an object defined in a library, I can link against it, and sub-class it in my code. I don't see how I need a ""framework"" for that. In some way he rather explains how the term framework is used nowadays. It's just a hyped word, as I said before. Some companies release just a normal library (in any sense of a classical library) and call it a ""framework"" because it sounds more fancy.","The difference between a framework and a library is not strictly defined and can vary depending on the context. Generally, a library is a collection of reusable code that provides a specific functionality, while a framework is a more comprehensive structure that can include libraries, scripts, and other software components to support application development.

154577,Polymorphism vs Overriding vs Overloading,"<strong>Polymorphism</strong> is the ability of a class instance to behave as if it were an instance of another class in its inheritance tree, most often one of its ancestor classes. For example, in Java all classes inherit from Object. Therefore, you can create a variable of type Object and assign to it an instance of any class. An <strong>override</strong> is a type of function which occurs in a class which inherits from another class. An override function ""replaces"" a function inherited from the base class, but does so in such a way that it is called even when an instance of its class is pretending to be a different type through polymorphism. Referring to the previous example, you could define your own class and override the toString() function. Because this function is inherited from Object, it will still be available if you copy an instance of this class into an Object-type variable. Normally, if you call toString() on your class while it is pretending to be an Object, the version of toString which will actually fire is the one defined on Object itself. However, because the function is an override, the definition of toString() from your class is used even when the class instance's true type is hidden behind polymorphism. <strong>Overloading</strong> is the action of defining multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters. It is unrelated to either overriding or polymorphism.","Here is a brief and accurate summary:

154577,Polymorphism vs Overriding vs Overloading,"Specifically saying overloading or overriding doesn't give the full picture. Polymorphism is simply the ability of an object to specialize its behavior based on its type. I would disagree with some of the answers here in that overloading is a form of polymorphism (parametric polymorphism) in the case that a method with the same name can behave differently give different parameter types. A good example is operator overloading. You can define ""+"" to accept different types of parameters -- say strings or int's -- and based on those types, ""+"" will behave differently. Polymorphism also includes inheritance and overriding methods, though they can be abstract or virtual in the base type. In terms of inheritance-based polymorphism, Java only supports single class inheritance limiting it polymorphic behavior to that of a single chain of base types.

171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"Nope, no destructors here. The reason is that all Java objects are heap allocated and garbage collected. Without explicit deallocation (i.e. C++'s delete operator) there is no sensible way to implement real destructors. Java does support finalizers, but they are meant to be used only as a safeguard for objects holding a handle to native resources like sockets, file handles, window handles, etc. When the garbage collector collects an object without a finalizer it simply marks the memory region as free and that's it. When the object has a finalizer, it's first copied into a temporary location (remember, we're garbage collecting here), then it's enqueued into a waiting-to-be-finalized queue and then a Finalizer thread polls the queue with very low priority and runs the finalizer. When the application exits, the JVM stops without waiting for the pending objects to be finalized, so there practically no guarantees that your finalizers will ever run.","In Java, there are no traditional destructors due to its garbage collection mechanism.

In addition to try-catch-finally blocks, you may use Runtime#addShutdownHook (introduced in Java 1.6) to perform final cleanups in your program. That isn't the same as destructors are, but one may implement a shutdown hook having listener objects registered on which cleanup methods (close persistent database connections, remove file locks, and so on) can be invoked - things that would normally be done in destructors.

171952,Is there a destructor for Java?,"First, note that since Java is garbage-collected, it is rare to need to do anything about object destruction. Firstly because you don't usually have any managed resources to free, and secondly because you can't predict when or if it will happen, so it's inappropriate for things that you need to occur ""as soon as nobody is using my object any more"". You can be notified after an object has been destroyed using java.lang.ref.PhantomReference (actually, saying it has been destroyed may be slightly inaccurate, but if a phantom reference to it is queued then it's no longer recoverable, which usually amounts to the same thing). A common use is: Separate out the resource(s) in your class that need to be destructed into another helper object (note that if all you're doing is closing a connection, which is a common case, you don't need to write a new class: the connection to be closed would be the ""helper object"" in that case). When you create your main object, create also a PhantomReference to it. Either have this refer to the new helper object, or set up a map from PhantomReference objects to their corresponding helper objects. After the main object is collected, the PhantomReference is queued (or rather it may be queued - like finalizers there is no guarantee it ever will be, for example if the VM exits then it won't wait). Make sure you're processing its queue (either in a special thread or from time to time). Because of the hard reference to the helper object, the helper object has not yet been collected. So do whatever cleanup you like on the helper object, then discard the PhantomReference and the helper will eventually be collected too. There is also finalize(), which looks like a destructor but doesn't behave like one. It's usually not a good option.","In Java, there is no traditional destructor like in other languages. Instead, Java's garbage collection handles object destruction.

184710,What is the difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy?,"In object oriented programming, a type includes a collection of member fields. These fields may be stored either by value or by reference (i.e., a pointer to a value). In a shallow copy, a new instance of the type is created and the values are copied into the new instance. The reference pointers are also copied just like the values. Therefore, the references are pointing to the original objects. Any changes to the members that are stored by reference appear in both the original and the copy, since no copy was made of the referenced object. In a deep copy, the fields that are stored by value are copied as before, but the pointers to objects stored by reference are not copied. Instead, a deep copy is made of the referenced object, and a pointer to the new object is stored. Any changes that are made to those referenced objects will not affect other copies of the object.","The key difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy is how they handle referenced objects.

214741,What is a StackOverflowError?,"A stack overflow is usually called by nesting function calls too deeply (especially easy when using recursion, i.e. a function that calls itself) or allocating a large amount of memory on the stack where using the heap would be more appropriate.","A StackOverflowError occurs when there are too many nested function calls, often due to recursion, or when excessive memory is allocated on the stack.",,"A stack overflow is usually called by nesting function calls too deeply (especially easy when using recursion, i.e. a function that calls itself) or allocating a large amount of memory on the stack where using the heap would be more appropriate."
214741,What is a StackOverflowError?,"If you have a function like: Then foo() will keep calling itself, getting deeper and deeper, and when the space used to keep track of what functions you're in is filled up, you get the stack overflow error.","A StackOverflowError occurs when a function calls itself recursively without terminating, exceeding the maximum stack space and causing the program to crash.",,"Then foo() will keep calling itself, getting deeper and deeper, and when the space used to keep track of what functions you're in is filled up, you get the stack overflow error."
214741,What is a StackOverflowError?,"Stack overflow means exactly that: a stack overflows. Usually there's a one stack in the program that contains local-scope variables and addresses where to return when execution of a routine ends. That stack tends to be a fixed memory range somewhere in the memory, therefore it's limited how much it can contain values. If the stack is empty you can't pop, if you do you'll get stack underflow error. If the stack is full you can't push, if you do you'll get stack overflow error. So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion. Some implementations optimize out some forms of recursions. Tail recursion in particular. Tail recursive routines are form of routines where the recursive call appears as a final thing what the routine does. Such routine call gets simply reduced into a jump. Some implementations go so far as implement their own stacks for recursion, therefore they allow the recursion to continue until the system runs out of memory. Easiest thing you could try would be to increase your stack size if you can. If you can't do that though, the second best thing would be to look whether there's something that clearly causes the stack overflow. Try it by printing something before and after the call into routine. This helps you to find out the failing routine.","A StackOverflowError occurs when the program's call stack, which stores local variables and return addresses, exceeds its limited memory capacity, often due to excessive recursion or large allocations, and can be mitigated by increasing stack size or optimizing recursive functions.","So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion.","So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion."

151969,When to use self over $this?,"<code>$this-&gt;</code> is used to refer to a specific instance of a class's variables (member variables) or methods. $derek is now a specific instance of Person.Every Person has a first_name and a last_name, but $derek has a specific first_name and last_name (Derek Martin). Inside the $derek instance, we can refer to those as $this->first_name and $this->last_name ClassName:: is used to refer to that type of class, and its static variables, static methods. If it helps, you can mentally replace the word ""static"" with ""shared"". Because they are shared, they cannot refer to $this, which refers to a specific instance (not shared). Static Variables (i.e. static $db_connection) can be shared among all instances of a type of object. For example, all database objects share a single connection (static $connection). <strong>Static Variables Example:</strong>Pretend we have a database class with a single member variable: static $num_connections;Now, put this in the constructor: Just as objects have constructors, they also have destructors, which are executed when the object dies or is unset: Every time we create a new instance, it will increase our connection counter by one. Every time we destroy or stop using an instance, it will decrease the connection counter by one. In this way, we can monitor the number of instances of the database object we have in use with: Because $num_connections is static (shared), it will reflect the total number of active database objects. You may have seen this technique used to share database connections among all instances of a database class. This is done because creating the database connection takes a long time, so it's best to create just one, and share it (this is called a Singleton Pattern). Static Methods (i.e. public static View::format_phone_number($digits)) can be used WITHOUT first instantiating one of those objects (i.e. They do not internally refer to $this). <strong>Static Method Example:</strong> As you can see, public static function prettyName knows nothing about the object. It's just working with the parameters you pass in, like a normal function that's not part of an object. Why bother, then, if we could just have it not as part of the object? <li>First, attaching functions to objects helps you keep things organized, so you know where to find them. <li>Second, it prevents naming conflicts. In a big project, you're likely to have two developers create getName() functions. If one creates a ClassName1::getName(), and the other creates ClassName2::getName(), it's no problem at all. No conflict.

224664,Difference between proxy server and reverse proxy server,"The difference is primarily in deployment. Web forward and reverse proxies all have the same underlying features, they accept requests for HTTP requests in various formats and provide a response, usually by accessing the origin or contact server. Fully featured servers usually have access control, caching, and some link-mapping features. A forward proxy is a proxy that is accessed by configuring the client machine. The client needs protocol support for proxy features (redirection, proxy auth, etc.). The proxy is transparent to the user experience, but not to the application. A reverse proxy is a proxy that is deployed as a web server and behaves like a web server, with the exception that instead of locally composing the content from programs and disk, it forwards the request to an origin server. From the client perspective it IS a web server, so the user experience is completely transparent. In fact, a single proxy instance can run as a forward and reverse proxy at the same time for different client populations. That's the short version, I can clarify if people want to comment.","The main difference between a proxy server and a reverse proxy server lies in their deployment and functionality.

All I did was update the instance method to return the next connection from the pool - no other changes required. That would have been far harder if we had NOT been using a singleton. Singletons are just fancy globals Can't argue with that but so are all static fields and methods - anything that is accessed from the class rather than an instance is essentially global and I dont see so much pushback on the use of static fields?

255898,How to iterate over arguments in a Bash script,"Rewrite of a now-deleted answer by VonC. Robert Gamble's succinct answer deals directly with the question. This one amplifies on some issues with filenames containing spaces. See also: ${1:+""$@""} in /bin/sh Basic thesis: <code>""$@""</code> is correct, and <code>$*</code> (unquoted) is almost always wrong. This is because <code>""$@""</code> works fine when arguments contain spaces, and works the same as <code>$*</code> when they don't. In some circumstances, <code>""$*""</code> is OK too, but <code>""$@""</code> usually (but not always) works in the same places. Unquoted, <code>$@</code> and <code>$*</code> are equivalent (and almost always wrong). So, what is the difference between <code>$*</code>, <code>$@</code>, <code>""$*""</code>, and <code>""$@""</code>? They are all related to 'all the arguments to the shell', but they do different things. When unquoted, <code>$*</code> and <code>$@</code> do the same thing. They treat each 'word' (sequence of non-whitespace) as a separate argument. The quoted forms are quite different, though: <code>""$*""</code> treats the argument list as a single space-separated string, whereas <code>""$@""</code> treats the arguments almost exactly as they were when specified on the command line. <code>""$@""</code> expands to nothing at all when there are no positional arguments; <code>""$*""</code> expands to an empty string &mdash; and yes, there's a difference, though it can be hard to perceive it. See more information below, after the introduction of the (non-standard) command <code>al</code>. Secondary thesis: if you need to process arguments with spaces and then pass them on to other commands, then you sometimes need non-standard tools to assist. (Or you should use arrays, carefully: <code>""${array[@]}""</code> behaves analogously to <code>""$@""</code>.) Example: Why doesn't that work? It doesn't work because the shell processes quotes before it expands variables. So, to get the shell to pay attention to the quotes embedded in <code>$var</code>, you have to use <code>eval</code>: This gets really tricky when you have file names such as "" "" (with quotes and double quotes and spaces). The shells (all of them) do not make it particularly easy to handle such stuff, so (funnily enough) many Unix programs do not do a good job of handling them. On Unix, a filename (single component) can contain any characters except slash and NUL <code>'\0'</code>. However, the shells strongly encourage no spaces or newlines or tabs anywhere in a path names. It is also why standard Unix file names do not contain spaces, etc. When dealing with file names that may contain spaces and other troublesome characters, you have to be extremely careful, and I found long ago that I needed a program that is not standard on Unix. I call it <code>escape</code> (version 1.1 was dated 1989-08-23T16:01:45Z). Here is an example of <code>escape</code> in use - with the SCCS control system. It is a cover script that does both a <code>delta</code> (think check-in) and a <code>get</code> (think check-out). Various arguments, especially <code>-y</code> (the reason why you made the change) would contain blanks and newlines. Note that the script dates from 1992, so it uses back-ticks instead of <code>$(cmd ...)</code> notation and does not use <code>#!/bin/sh</code> on the first line. (I would probably not use escape quite so thoroughly these days - it is not needed with the <code>-e</code> argument, for example - but overall, this is one of my simpler scripts using <code>escape</code>.) The <code>escape</code> program simply outputs its arguments, rather like <code>echo</code> does, but it ensures that the arguments are protected for use with <code>eval</code> (one level of <code>eval</code>; I do have a program which did remote shell execution, and that needed to escape the output of <code>escape</code>). I have another program called <code>al</code> that lists its arguments one per line (and it is even more ancient: version 1.1 dated 1987-01-27T14:35:49). It is most useful when debugging scripts, as it can be plugged into a command line to see what arguments are actually passed to the command. [Added: And now to show the difference between the various <code>""$@""</code> notations, here is one more example: Notice that nothing preserves the original blanks between the <code>*</code> and <code>*/*</code> on the command line. Also, note that you can change the 'command line arguments' in the shell by using: This sets 4 options, '<code>-new</code>', '<code>-opt</code>', '<code>and</code>', and '<code>arg with space</code>'. ] Hmm, that's quite a long answer - perhaps exegesis is the better term. Source code for <code>escape</code> available on request (email to firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com). The source code for <code>al</code> is incredibly simple: That's all. It is equivalent to the <code>test.sh</code> script that Robert Gamble showed, and could be written as a shell function (but shell functions didn't exist in the local version of Bourne shell when I first wrote <code>al</code>). Also note that you can write <code>al</code> as a simple shell script: The conditional is needed so that it produces no output when passed no arguments. The <code>printf</code> command will produce a blank line with only the format string argument, but the C program produces nothing.","To iterate over arguments in a Bash script, use `""$@""` to correctly handle arguments with spaces. Unquoted `$@` and `$*` are equivalent and often incorrect, treating each word as a separate argument. Quoted `""$*""` treats the argument list as a single string, while `""$@""` preserves the original arguments. When dealing with file names containing spaces, use caution and consider non-standard tools or arrays. The `escape` and `al` programs can assist with handling complex arguments and debugging scripts.","Unquoted, <code>$@</code> and <code>$*</code> are equivalent (and almost always wrong).

27581,What issues should be considered when overriding equals and hashCode in Java?,"There are some issues worth noticing if you're dealing with classes that are persisted using an Object-Relationship Mapper (ORM) like Hibernate, if you didn't think this was unreasonably complicated already! <strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong> If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return <code>false</code>. For example: <em>If you're dealing with an ORM, using <code>o instanceof Person</code> is the only thing that will behave correctly.</em> <strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong> ORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that <code>person.name</code> will be <code>null</code> if <code>person</code> is lazy loaded, even if <code>person.getName()</code> forces loading and returns ""John Doe"". In my experience, this crops up more often in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>. <em>If you're dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>.</em> <strong>Saving an object will change its state</strong> Persistent objects often use a <code>id</code> field to hold the key of the object.

A pattern I often use is But: you cannot include <code>getId()</code> in <code>hashCode()</code>. If you do, when an object is persisted, its <code>hashCode</code> changes. If the object is in a <code>HashSet</code>, you'll ""never"" find it again. In my <code>Person</code> example, I probably would use <code>getName()</code> for <code>hashCode</code> and <code>getId()</code> plus <code>getName()</code> (just for paranoia) for <code>equals()</code>. It's okay if there are some risk of ""collisions"" for <code>hashCode()</code>, but never okay for <code>equals()</code>. <em><code>hashCode()</code> should use the non-changing subset of properties from <code>equals()</code></em>","When overriding `equals` and `hashCode` in Java, especially with Object-Relationship Mappers (ORMs) like Hibernate, consider the following issues:

2. **Lazy loaded objects have null-fields**: Use getters instead of field references in `hashCode()` and `equals()`.

214741,What is a StackOverflowError?,"Parameters and local variables are allocated on the stack (with reference types the object lives on the heap and a variable references that object). The stack typically lives at the upper end of your address space and as it is used up it heads towards the bottom of the address space (i.e. towards zero). Your process also has a heap, which lives at the bottom end of your process. As you allocate memory, this heap can grow towards the upper end of your address space. As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to ""collide"" with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!! ). The common cause for a stack overflow is a bad recursive call. Typically, this is caused when your recursive functions doesn't have the correct termination condition, so it ends up calling itself forever. However, with GUI programming, it's possible to generate indirect recursion. For example, your app may be handling paint messages, and, whilst processing them, it may call a function that causes the system to send another paint message. Here you've not explicitly called yourself, but the OS/VM has done it for you. To deal with them, you'll need to examine your code. If you've got functions that call themselves then check that you've got a terminating condition. If you have, then check that when calling the function you have at least modified one of the arguments, otherwise there'll be no visible change for the recursively called function and the terminating condition is useless. If you've got no obvious recursive functions then check to see if you're calling any library functions that indirectly will cause your function to be called (like the implicit case above).","A StackOverflowError occurs when the stack and heap in a program's address space collide, often due to infinite recursion caused by a function calling itself without a proper termination condition, which can be direct or indirect, such as through GUI event handling.

62814,Difference between binary semaphore and mutex,"At a theoretical level, they are no different semantically. You can implement a mutex using semaphores or vice versa (see here for an example). In practice, the implementation is different and they offer slightly different services. The practical difference (in terms of the system services surrounding them) is that the implementation of a mutex is aimed at being a more lightweight synchronisation mechanism. In oracle-speak, mutexes are known as latches and semaphores are known as waits. At the lowest level, they use some sort of atomic test and set mechanism. This reads the current value of a memory location, computes some sort of conditional and writes out a value at that location in a single instruction that cannot be interrupted. This means that you can acquire a mutex and test to see if anyone else had it before you. A typical mutex implementation has a process or thread executing the test-and-set instruction and evaluating whether anything else had set the mutex. A key point here is that there is no interaction with the scheduler, so we have no idea (and don't care) who has set the lock. Then we either give up our time slice and attempt it again when the task is re-scheduled or execute a spin-lock. A spin lock is an algorithm like: When we have finished executing our protected code (known as a critical section) we just set the mutex value to zero or whatever means 'clear.' If multiple tasks are attempting to acquire the mutex they the next task that happens to be scheduled after the mutex is released will get access to the resource. Typically you would use mutexes to control a synchronised resource where exclusive access is only needed for very short periods of time, normally to make an update to a shared data structure. A semaphore is a synchronised data structure (typically using a mutex) that has a count and some system call wrappers that interact with the scheduler in a bit more depth than the mutex libraries would. Semaphores are incremented and decremented and used to block tasks until something else is ready. See Producer/Consumer Problem for a simple example of this. Semaphores are initialised to some value - a binary semaphore is just a special case where the semaphore is initialised to 1. Posting to a semaphore has the effect of waking up a waiting process. A basic semaphore algorithm looks like: In the case of a binary semaphore the main practical difference between the two is the nature of the system services surrounding the actual data structure. EDIT: As evan has rightly pointed out, spinlocks will slow down a single processor machine. You would only use a spinlock on a multi-processor box because on a single processor the process holding the mutex will never reset it while another task is running. Spinlocks are only useful on multi-processor architectures.","**Binary Semaphore vs Mutex:**

Theoretically, binary semaphores and mutexes are equivalent, but practically, they differ in implementation and services offered. A mutex is a lightweight synchronization mechanism, typically used for short periods of exclusive access, whereas a semaphore is a synchronized data structure with a count, used to block tasks until a condition is met. A binary semaphore is a special case of a semaphore initialized to 1. The key difference lies in their system services and usage: mutexes are suitable for short, exclusive access, while semaphores are used for more complex synchronization scenarios, such as the Producer/Consumer Problem.","In practice, the implementation is different and they offer slightly different services.

A mutex object only allows one   thread into a controlled section,   forcing other threads which attempt to   gain access to that section to wait   until the first thread has exited from   that section."" Ref: Symbian Developer   Library (A mutex is really a semaphore with   value 1.) Semaphore: Is the number of free identical toilet   keys.

The semaphore count - the count of   keys - is set to 4 at beginning (all   four toilets are free), then the count   value is decremented as people are   coming in. If all toilets are full,   ie. there are no free keys left, the   semaphore count is 0. Now, when eq.   one person leaves the toilet,   semaphore is increased to 1 (one free   key), and given to the next person in   the queue. Officially: ""A semaphore restricts the   number of simultaneous users of a   shared resource up to a maximum   number. Threads can request access to   the resource (decrementing the   semaphore), and can signal that they   have finished using the resource   (incrementing the semaphore).""

356645,Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.,"It runs successfully the first time,   but if I run it again, I keep getting   a System.OutOfMemoryException. What   are some reasons this could be   happening? Regardless of what the others have said, the error has nothing to do with forgetting to dispose your DBCommand or DBConnection, and you will not fix your error by disposing of either of them. The error has everything to do with your dataset which contains nearly 600,000 rows of data. Apparently your dataset consumes more than 50% of the available memory on your machine. Clearly, you'll run out of memory when you return another dataset of the same size before the first one has been garbage collected. Simple as that. You can remedy this problem in a few ways: Consider returning fewer records. I personally can't imagine a time when returning 600K records has ever been useful to a user. To minimize the records returned, try: Limiting your query to the first 1000 records. If there are more than 1000 results returned from the query, inform the user to narrow their search results. If your users really insist on seeing that much data at once, try paging the data. Remember: Google never shows you all 22 bajillion results of a search at once, it shows you 20 or so records at a time. Google probably doesn't hold all 22 bajillion results in memory at once, it probably finds its more memory efficient to requery its database to generate a new page. If you just need to iterate through the data and you don't need random access, try returning a datareader instead. A datareader only loads one record into memory at a time. If none of those are an option, then you need to force .NET to free up the memory used by the dataset before calling your method using one of these methods: Remove all references to your old dataset. Anything holding on to a refenence of your dataset will prevent it from being reclaimed by memory. If you can't null all the references to your dataset, clear all of the rows from the dataset and any objects bound to those rows instead. This removes references to the datarows and allows them to be eaten by the garbage collector. I don't believe you'll need to call <code>GC.Collect()</code> to force a gen cycle. Not only is it generally a bad idea to call <code>GC.Collect()</code>, because sufficient memory pressure will cause .NET invoke the garbage collector on its own. Note: calling Dispose on your dataset does not free any memory, nor does it invoke the garbage collector, nor does it remove a reference to your dataset. Dispose is used to clean up unmanaged resources, but the DataSet does not have any unmanaged resources. It only implements IDispoable because it inherents from MarshalByValueComponent, so the Dispose method on the dataset is pretty much useless.","The System.OutOfMemoryException occurs because the dataset with 600,000 rows consumes over 50% of available memory. To resolve this, consider returning fewer records by limiting query results, implementing paging, or using a datareader. If none of these options are feasible, remove references to the old dataset or clear its rows to allow the garbage collector to free up memory.

224664,Difference between proxy server and reverse proxy server,"The previous answers were accurate, but perhaps too terse. I will try to add some examples. First of all, the word ""proxy"" describes someone or something acting on behalf of someone else. In the computer realm, we are talking about one server acting on the behalf of another computer. For the purposes of accessibility, I will limit my discussion to web proxies - however, the idea of a proxy is not limited to websites. FORWARD proxy Most discussion of web proxies refers to the type of proxy known as a ""forward proxy."" The proxy event, in this case, is that the ""forward proxy"" retrieves data from another web site on behalf of the original requestee. A tale of 3 computers (part I) For an example, I will list three computers connected to the internet. X = your computer, or ""client"" computer on the internet Y = the proxy web site, proxy.example.org Z = the web site you want to visit, www.example.net Normally, one would connect directly from <code>X --&gt; Z.</code> However, in some scenarios, it is better for <code>Y --&gt; Z</code> on behalf of <code>X</code>, which chains as follows: <code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code>. Reasons why X would want to use a forward proxy server: Here is a (very) partial list of uses of a forward proxy server. 1) X is unable to access Z directly because a) Someone with administrative authority over <code>X</code>'s internet connection has decided to block all access to site <code>Z</code>. Examples: The Storm Worm virus is spreading by tricking people into visiting <code>familypostcards2008.com</code>, so the system administrator has blocked access to the site to prevent users from inadvertently infecting themselves. Employees at a large company have been wasting too much time on <code>facebook.com</code>, so management wants access blocked during business hours. A local elementary school disallows internet access to the <code>playboy.com</code> website. A government is unable to control the publishing of news, so it controls access to news instead, by blocking sites such as <code>wikipedia.org</code>. See TOR or FreeNet. b) The administrator of <code>Z</code> has blocked <code>X</code>. Examples: The administrator of Z has noticed hacking attempts coming from X, so the administrator has decided to block X's IP address (and/or netrange). Z is a forum website. <code>X</code> is spamming the forum. Z blocks X. REVERSE proxy A tale of 3 computers (part II) For this example, I will list three computers connected to the internet. X = your computer, or ""client"" computer on the internet Y = the reverse proxy web site, proxy.example.com Z = the web site you want to visit, www.example.net Normally, one would connect directly from <code>X --&gt; Z.</code> However, in some scenarios, it is better for the administrator of <code>Z</code> to restrict or disallow direct access and force visitors to go through Y first. So, as before, we have data being retrieved by <code>Y --&gt; Z</code> on behalf of <code>X</code>, which chains as follows: <code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code>. What is different this time compared to a ""forward proxy,"" is that this time the user <code>X</code> does not know he is accessing <code>Z</code>, because the user <code>X</code> only sees he is communicating with <code>Y</code>. The server <code>Z</code> is invisible to clients and only the reverse proxy <code>Y</code> is visible externally. A reverse proxy requires no (proxy) configuration on the client side. The client <code>X</code> thinks he is only communicating with <code>Y</code> (<code>X --&gt; Y</code>), but the reality is that <code>Y</code> forwarding all communication (<code>X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z</code> again). Reasons why Z would want to set up a reverse proxy server: 1) Z wants to force all traffic to its web site to pass through Y first. a) Z has a large web site that millions of people want to see, but a single web server cannot handle all the traffic. So Z sets up many servers and puts a reverse proxy on the internet that will send users to the server closest to them when they try to visit Z. This is part of how the Content Distribution Network (CDN) concept works. Examples: Apple Trailers uses Akamai Jquery.com hosts its javascript files using CloudFront CDN (sample). etc. 2) The administrator of Z is worried about retaliation for content hosted on the server and does not want to expose the main server directly to the public. a) Owners of Spam brands such as ""Canadian Pharmacy"" appear to have thousands of servers, while in reality having most websites hosted on far fewer servers. Additionally, abuse complaints about the spam will only shut down the public servers, not the main server. In the above scenarios, <code>Z</code> has the ability to choose <code>Y</code>.

The key differences are:

* Forward proxy: Client X knows it's using a proxy (Y) to access Z, and the proxy is configured on the client side.
* Reverse proxy: Client X doesn't know it's using a proxy (Y) to access Z, and the proxy is configured on the server side (Z).

383692,What is JSON and why would I use it?,"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript). As stated in the MDN, some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript. An example of  where this is used is web services responses. In the 'old' days, web services used XML as their primary data format for transmitting back data, but since JSON appeared (The JSON format is specified in RFC 4627 by Douglas Crockford), it has been the preferred format because it is much more lightweight You can find a lot more info on the official JSON web site. JSON is built on two structures: A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array. An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence. JSON Structure Here is an example of JSON data: JSON in JavaScript JSON (in Javascript) is a string! People often assume all Javascript objects are JSON and that JSON is a Javascript object. This is incorrect. In Javascript <code>var x = {x:y}</code> is not JSON, this is a Javascript object. The two are not the same thing. The JSON equivalent (represented in the Javascript language) would be <code>var x = '{""x"":""y""}'</code>. <code>x</code> is an object of type string not an object in it's own right. To turn this into a fully fledged Javascript object you must first parse it, <code>var x = JSON.parse('{""x"":""y""}');</code>, <code>x</code> is now an object but this is not JSON anymore. See Javascript object Vs JSON When working with JSON and JavaScript, you may be tempted to use the <code>eval</code> function to evaluate the result returned in the callback, but this is not suggested since there are two characters (U+2028 &amp; U+2029) valid in JSON but not in JavaScript (read more of this here). Therefore, one must always try to use Crockford's script that checks for a valid JSON before evaluating it. Link to the script explanation is found here and here is a direct link to the js file. Every major browser nowadays has its own implementation for this. Example on how to use the JSON parser (with the json from the above code snippet): The JSON parser also offers another very useful method, <code>stringify</code>. This method accepts a JavaScript object as a parameter, and outputs back a string with JSON format. This is useful for when you want to send data back to the server: The above two methods (<code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code>) also take a second parameter, which is a function that will be called for every key and value at every level of the final result, and each value will be replaced by result of your inputted function.

389741,"What is the ""continue"" keyword and how does it work in Java?","A <code>continue</code> statement without a label will re-execute from the condition the innermost <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> loop, and from the update expression of the innermost <code>for</code> loop. It is often used to early-terminate a loop's processing and thereby avoid deeply-nested <code>if</code> statements. In the following example <code>continue</code> will get the next line, without processing the following statement in the loop. With a label, <code>continue</code> will re-execute from the loop with the corresponding label, rather than the innermost loop. This can be used to escape deeply-nested loops, or simply for clarity.

389741,"What is the ""continue"" keyword and how does it work in Java?","Generally, I see <code>continue</code> (and <code>break</code>) as a warning that the code might use some refactoring, especially if the <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> loop declaration isn't immediately in sight. The same is true for <code>return</code> in the middle of a method, but for a slightly different reason. As others have already said, <code>continue</code> moves along to the next iteration of the loop, while <code>break</code> moves out of the enclosing loop. These can be maintenance timebombs because there is no immediate link between the <code>continue</code>/<code>break</code> and the loop it is continuing/breaking other than context; add an inner loop or move the ""guts"" of the loop into a separate method and you have a hidden effect of the <code>continue</code>/<code>break</code> failing. IMHO, it's best to use them as a measure of last resort, and then to make sure their use is grouped together tightly at the start or end of the loop so that the next developer can  see the ""bounds"" of the loop in one screen. <code>continue</code>, <code>break</code>, and <code>return</code> (other than the One True Return at the end of your method) all fall into the general category of ""hidden GOTOs"". They place loop and function control in unexpected places, which then eventually causes bugs.","The `continue` keyword in Java skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of a loop.

295579,Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer,"I figured out a method that works ~35% faster than your 6bits+Carmack+sqrt code, at least with my CPU (x86) and programming language (C/C++). Your results may vary, especially because I don't know how the Java factor will play out. My approach is threefold: <li>First, filter out obvious answers. This includes negative numbers and looking at the last 4 bits. (I found looking at the last six didn't help.) I also answer yes for 0. (In reading the code below, note that my input is <code>int64 x</code>. )<code>if( x &lt; 0 || (x&2) || ((x & 7) == 5) || ((x & 11) == 8) )    return false;if( x == 0 )    return true;</code> BIGBLOCK <li>Next, check if it's a square modulo 255 = 3 * 5 * 17. Because that's a product of three distinct primes, only about 1/8 of the residues mod 255 are squares. However, in my experience, calling the modulo operator (%) costs more than the benefit one gets, so I use bit tricks involving 255 = 2^8-1 to compute the residue. (For better or worse, I am not using the trick of reading individual bytes out of a word, only bitwise-and and shifts. )<code>int64 y = x;y = (y & 4294967295LL) + (y &gt;&gt; 32); y = (y & 65535) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);y = (y & 255) + ((y &gt;&gt; 8) & 255) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);// At this point, y is between 0 and 511. More code can reduce it farther. BIGBLOCK </code>To actually check if the residue is a square, I look up the answer in a precomputed table.<code>if( bad255[y] )    return false;// However, I just use a table of size 512</code> BIGBLOCK <li>Finally, try to compute the square root using a method similar to Hensel's lemma. (I don't think it's applicable directly, but it works with some modifications.) Before doing that, I divide out all powers of 2 with a binary search:<code>if((x & 4294967295LL) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 32;if((x & 65535) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 16;if((x & 255) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 8;if((x & 15) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 4;if((x & 3) == 0)    x &gt;&gt;= 2;</code> BIGBLOCK At this point, for our number to be a square, it must be 1 mod 8.<code>if((x & 7) != 1)    return false;</code> BIGBLOCK The basic structure of Hensel's lemma is the following. (Note: untested code; if it doesn't work, try t=2 or 8. )<code>int64 t = 4, r = 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;t &lt;&lt;= 1; r += ((x - r * r) & t) &gt;&gt; 1;// Repeat until t is 2^33 or so. Use a loop if you want.</code> BIGBLOCK The idea is that at each iteration, you add one bit onto r, the ""current"" square root of x; each square root is accurate modulo a larger and larger power of 2, namely t/2. At the end, r and t/2-r will be square roots of x modulo t/2. (Note that if r is a square root of x, then so is -r.  This is true even modulo numbers, but beware, modulo some numbers, things can have even more than 2 square roots; notably, this includes powers of 2.) Because our actual square root is less than 2^32, at that point we can actually just check if r or t/2-r are real square roots. In my actual code, I use the following modified loop:<code>int64 r, t, z;r = start[(x &gt;&gt; 3) & 1023];do {    z = x - r * r;    if( z == 0 )        return true;    if( z &lt; 0 )        return false;    t = z & (-z);    r += (z & t) &gt;&gt; 1;    if( r &gt; (t &gt;&gt; 1) )        r = t - r;} while( t &lt;= (1LL &lt;&lt; 33) );</code> BIGBLOCK The speedup here is obtained in three ways: precomputed start value (equivalent to ~10 iterations of the loop), earlier exit of the loop, and skipping some t values. For the last part, I look at <code>z = r - x * x</code>, and set t to be the largest power of 2 dividing z with a bit trick. This allows me to skip t values that wouldn't have affected the value of r anyway. The precomputed start value in my case picks out the ""smallest positive"" square root modulo 8192. Even if this code doesn't work faster for you, I hope you enjoy some of the ideas it contains. Complete, tested code follows, including the precomputed tables. BIGBLOCK","To determine if an integer's square root is an integer, a three-step approach can be used: 
1. Filter out obvious non-squares by checking for negative numbers and examining the last 4 bits.

3. If necessary, compute the square root using a modified version of Hensel's lemma, which iteratively refines the estimate of the square root.

75191,What is an unsigned char?,"Because i feel it's really called for, i just want to state some rules of C and C++ (they are the same in this regard). First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object. Second, <code>unsigned char</code> is explicitly stated unsigned. Now, i had a discussion with someone about what happens when you convert the value <code>-1</code> of type int to <code>unsigned char</code>. He refused the idea that the resulting <code>unsigned char</code> has all its bits set to 1, because he was worried about sign representation. But he don't have to. It's immediately following out of this rule that the conversion does what is intended: If the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or   subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type   until the value is in the range of the new type. (<code>6.3.1.3p2</code> in a C99 draft) That's a mathematical description. C++ describes it in terms of modulo calculus, which yields to the same rule. Anyway, what is not guaranteed is that all bits in the integer <code>-1</code> are one before the conversion. So, what do we have so we can claim that the resulting <code>unsigned char</code> has all its <code>CHAR_BIT</code> bits turned to 1? All bits participate in determining its value - that is, no padding bits occur in the object. Adding only one time <code>UCHAR_MAX+1</code> to <code>-1</code> will yield a value in range, namely <code>UCHAR_MAX</code> That's enough, actually! So whenever you want to have an <code>unsigned char</code> having all its bits one, you do It also follows that a conversion is not just truncating higher order bits. The fortunate event for two's complement is that it is just a truncation there, but the same isn't necessarily true for other sign representations.","In C and C++, an `unsigned char` is a type where all bits participate in determining its value, with no padding bits. When converting a negative integer, such as `-1`, to an `unsigned char`, the resulting value will have all its bits set to 1, as the conversion process involves adding or subtracting the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until the value is in range. This is guaranteed by the language standards, regardless of the sign representation used.","First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object. If the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or   until the value is in the range of the new type.","First, all bits of <code>unsigned char</code> participate in determining the value if any unsigned char object.

To create a stored procedure the syntax is fairly simple: So for example: A benefit of stored procedures is that you can centralize data access logic into a single place that is then easy for DBA's to optimize. Stored procedures also have a security benefit in that you can grant execute rights to a stored procedure but the user will not need to have read/write permissions on the underlying tables. This is a good first step against SQL injection. Stored procedures do come with downsides, basically the maintenance associated with your basic CRUD operation. Let's say for each table you have an Insert, Update, Delete and at least one select based on the primary key, that means each table will have 4 procedures.

Now, let's have a look at the following snippet: Since Base's destructor is not <code>virtual</code> and <code>b</code> is a <code>Base*</code> pointing to a <code>Derived</code> object, <code>delete b</code> has undefined behaviour: [In <code>delete b</code>], if the static type of the  object to be deleted is different from its dynamic type, the static  type shall be a base class of the dynamic type of the object to be  deleted and <strong>the static type shall have a virtual destructor or the  behavior is undefined</strong>. In most implementations, the call to the destructor will be resolved like any non-virtual code, meaning that the destructor of the base class will be called but not the one of the derived class, resulting in a resources leak. To sum up, always make base classes' destructors <code>virtual</code> when they're meant to be manipulated polymorphically.

487258,"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?","EDIT: Quick note, this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation (which is both an upper and lower bound). In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. In one sentence: As the size of your job goes up, how much longer does it take to complete it? Obviously that's only using ""size"" as the input and ""time taken"" as the output &mdash; the same idea applies if you want to talk about memory usage etc. Here's an example where we have N T-shirts which we want to dry. We'll <em>assume</em> it's incredibly quick to get them in the drying position (i.e. the human interaction is negligible). That's not the case in real life, of course... <li>Using a washing line outside: assuming you have an infinitely large back yard, washing dries in O(1) time. However much you have of it, it'll get the same sun and fresh air, so the size doesn't affect the drying time. <li>Using a tumble dryer: you put 10 shirts in each load, and then they're done an hour later. (Ignore the actual numbers here &mdash; they're irrelevant.) So drying 50 shirts takes <em>about</em> 5 times as long as drying 10 shirts. <li>Putting everything in an airing cupboard: If we put everything in one big pile and just let general warmth do it, it will take a long time for the middle shirts to get dry. I wouldn't like to guess at the detail, but I suspect this is at least O(N^2) &mdash; as you increase the wash load, the drying time increases faster. One important aspect of ""big O"" notation is that it <em>doesn't</em> say which algorithm will be faster for a given size. Take a hashtable (string key, integer value)  vs an array of pairs (string, integer). Is it faster to find a key in the hashtable or an element in the array, based on a string? (i.e. for the array, ""find the first element where the string part matches the given key."") Hashtables are generally amortised (~= ""on average"") O(1) &mdash; once they're set up, it should take about the same time to find an entry in a 100 entry table as in a 1,000,000 entry table. Finding an element in an array (based on content rather than index) is linear, i.e. O(N) &mdash; on average, you're going to have to look at half the entries. Does this make a hashtable faster than an array for lookups? Not necessarily. If you've got a very small collection of entries, an array may well be faster &mdash; you may be able to check all the strings in the time that it takes to just calculate the hashcode of the one you're looking at. As the data set grows larger, however, the hashtable will eventually beat the array.","Big O notation measures how the time or resource requirements of an algorithm change as the input size increases.

487258,"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?","Quick note, this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation (which is a two-side bound). In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: The simplest definition I can give for Big-O notation is this: <strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> There are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence: <li><strong>relative:</strong> you can only compare apples to apples. You can't compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers. But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful; <li><strong>representation:</strong> Big-O (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable. That variable is chosen based on observations or assumptions. For example, sorting algorithms are typically compared based on comparison operations (comparing two nodes to determine their relative ordering). This assumes that comparison is expensive. But what if comparison is cheap but swapping is expensive? It changes the comparison; and <li><strong>complexity:</strong> if it takes me one second to sort 10,000 elements how long will it take me to sort one million? Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else. Come back and reread the above when you've read the rest. The best example of Big-O I can think of is doing arithmetic. Take two numbers (123456 and 789012). The basic arithmetic operations we learnt in school were: <li>addition; <li>subtraction; <li>multiplication; and <li>division. Each of these is an operation or a problem. A method of solving these is called an <strong>algorithm</strong>. Addition is the simplest. You line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition in the result. The 'tens' part of that number is carried over to the next column. Let's assume that the addition of these numbers is the most expensive operation in this algorithm. It stands to reason that to add these two numbers together we have to add together 6 digits (and possibly carry a 7th). If we add two 100 digit numbers together we have to do 100 additions. If we add <strong>two</strong> 10,000 digit numbers we have to do 10,000 additions. See the pattern? The <strong>complexity</strong> (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits <em>n</em> in the larger number. We call this <strong>O(n)</strong> or <strong>linear complexity</strong>. Subtraction is similar (except you may need to borrow instead of carry). Multiplication is different. You line the numbers up, take the first digit in the bottom number and multiply it in turn against each digit in the top number and so on through each digit. So to multiply our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplications. We may need to do as many as 10 or 11 column adds to get the end result too. If we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10,000 multiplications and 200 adds. For two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (1012) multiplications and two million adds. As the algorithm scales with n-<em>squared</em>, this is <strong>O(n2)</strong> or <strong>quadratic complexity</strong>. This is a good time to introduce another important concept: <strong>We only care about the most significant portion of complexity.</strong> The astute may have realized that we could express the number of operations as: n2 + 2n. But as you saw from our example with two numbers of a million digits apiece, the second term (2n) becomes insignificant (accounting for 0.0002% of the total operations by that stage). One can notice that we've assumed the worst case scenario here. While multiplying 6 digit numbers if one of them is 4 digit and the other one is 6 digit, then we only have 24 multiplications. Still we calculate the worst case scenario for that 'n', i.e when both are 6 digit numbers. Hence Big-O notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm The Telephone Book The next best example I can think of is the telephone book, normally called the White Pages or similar but it'll vary from country to country. But I'm talking about the one that lists people by surname and then initials or first name, possibly address and then telephone numbers. Now if you were instructing a computer to look up the phone number for ""John Smith"" in a telephone book that contains 1,000,000 names, what would you do? Ignoring the fact that you could guess how far in the S's started (let's assume you can't), what would you do? A typical implementation might be to open up to the middle, take the 500,000th and compare it to ""Smith"". If it happens to be ""Smith, John"", we just got real lucky. Far more likely is that ""John Smith"" will be before or after that name. If it's after we then divide the last half of the phone book in half and repeat. If it's before then we divide the first half of the phone book in half and repeat. And so on. This is called a <strong>binary search</strong> and is used every day in programming whether you realize it or not. So if you want to find a name in a phone book of a million names you can actually find any name by doing this at most 20 times. In comparing search algorithms we decide that this comparison is our 'n'. <li>For a phone book of 3 names it takes 2 comparisons (at most). <li>For 7 it takes at most 3. <li>For 15 it takes 4. <li>For 1,000,000 it takes 20. That is staggeringly good isn't it? In Big-O terms this is <strong>O(log n)</strong> or <strong>logarithmic complexity</strong>. Now the logarithm in question could be ln (base e), log10, log2 or some other base. It doesn't matter it's still O(log n) just like O(2n2) and O(100n2) are still both O(n2). It's worthwhile at this point to explain that Big O can be used to determine three cases with an algorithm: <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> In the telephone book search, the best case is that we find the name in one comparison. This is <strong>O(1)</strong> or <strong>constant complexity</strong>; <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> As discussed above this is O(log n); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> This is also O(log n). Normally we don't care about the best case. We're interested in the expected and worst case. Sometimes one or the other of these will be more important. Back to the telephone book. What if you have a phone number and want to find a name? The police have a reverse phone book but such look-ups are denied to the general public. Or are they? Technically you can reverse look-up a number in an ordinary phone book. How? You start at the first name and compare the number. If it's a match, great, if not, you move on to the next. You have to do it this way because the phone book is <strong>unordered</strong> (by phone number anyway). So to find a name given the phone number (reverse lookup): <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> O(1); <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> O(n) (for 500,000); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> O(n) (for 1,000,000). The Travelling Salesman This is quite a famous problem in computer science and deserves a mention. In this problem you have N towns. Each of those towns is linked to 1 or more other towns by a road of a certain distance. The Travelling Salesman problem is to find the shortest tour that visits every town. Sounds simple? Think again. If you have 3 towns A, B and C with roads between all pairs then you could go: So the Big-O of the Travelling Salesman problem is <strong>O(n! )</strong> or <strong>factorial or combinatorial complexity</strong>. <strong>By the time you get to 200 towns there isn't enough time left in the universe to solve the problem with traditional computers.</strong> Something to think about. Polynomial Time Another point I wanted to make quick mention of is that any algorithm that has a complexity of <strong>O(na)</strong> is said to have <strong>polynomial complexity</strong> or is solvable in <strong>polynomial time</strong>. O(n), O(n2) etc are all polynomial time. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time. Certain things are used in the world because of this. Public Key Cryptography is a prime example. It is computationally hard to find two prime factors of a very large number. If it wasn't, we couldn't use the public key systems we use. Anyway, that's it for my (hopefully plain English) explanation of Big O (revised).","Big O notation is a relative representation of an algorithm's complexity, which refers to the amount of time or resources it requires as the input size increases. It's a way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms, focusing on the worst-case scenario. The notation is often expressed as a function of the input size, such as O(n) for linear complexity, O(n^2) for quadratic complexity, or O(log n) for logarithmic complexity. The concept is illustrated through examples like arithmetic operations and searching a telephone book, highlighting the importance of considering the most significant portion of complexity and ignoring less significant terms. Big O notation helps analyze an","<strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else.

Hence Big-O notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm In Big-O terms this is <strong>O(log n)</strong> or <strong>logarithmic complexity</strong>. Back to the telephone book.","Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: <strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> You can't compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers.

487258,"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?","<strong>Big O describes the fundamental scaling nature of an algorithm.</strong> There is a lot of information that Big O does not tell you about a given algorithm. It cuts to the bone and gives only information about the scaling nature of an algorithm, specifically how the resource use (think time or memory) of an algorithm scales in response to the ""input size"". Consider the difference between a steam engine and a rocket. They are not merely different varieties of the same thing (as, say, a Prius engine vs. a Lamborghini engine) but they are dramatically different kinds of propulsion systems, at their core. A steam engine may be faster than a toy rocket, but no steam piston engine will be able to achieve the speeds of an orbital launch vehicle. This is because these systems have different scaling characteristics with regards to the relation of fuel required (""resource usage"") to reach a given speed (""input size""). Why is this so important? Because software deals with problems that may differ in size by factors up to a trillion. Consider that for a moment. The ratio between the speed necessary to travel to the Moon and human walking speed is less than 10,000:1, and that is absolutely tiny compared to the range in input sizes software may face. And because software may face an astronomical range in input sizes there is the potential for the Big O complexity of an algorithm, it's fundamental scaling nature, to trump any implementation details. Consider the canonical sorting example. Bubble-sort is O(n2) while merge-sort is O(n log n). Let's say you have two sorting applications, application A which uses bubble-sort and application B which uses merge-sort, and let's say that for input sizes of around 30 elements application A is 1,000x faster than application B at sorting. If you never have to sort much more than 30 elements then it's obvious that you should prefer application A, as it is much faster at these input sizes. However, if you find that you may have to sort ten million items then what you'd expect is that application B actually ends up being thousands of times faster than application A in this case, entirely due to the way each algorithm scales.","**Big O notation** describes how an algorithm's resource use (time or memory) scales with the size of the input.

2056,What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?,"Something I don't get is why data binding has to reduce testability. I mean, a view is effectively based off of what could be thought of as one or more database views, right? There might be connections between rows in different views. Alternatively, we can talk object-oriented instead of relational, but that actually doesn't change anything -- we still have one or more distinct data entities. If we view programming as data structures + algorithms, then wouldn't it be best to have the data structures made explicit as possible, and then develop algorithms that each depend on as small a piece of data as possible, with minimal coupling between the algorithms? I sense very Java-esque FactoryFactoryFactory thought patterns here -- we want to have multiple views, multiple models, multiple degrees of freedom all over the place. It's almost like that is the driving force behind MVC and MVP and whatnot. Now let me ask this: how often is the cost you pay for this (and there most definitely is a cost) worth it? I also see no discussion of how to efficiently manage state between HTTP requests. Haven't we learned from the functional folks (and the voluminous mistakes made by imperative spaghetti) that state is evil and should be minimized (and when used, should be well understood)?

For example, you are using the <code>Array</code> class and you also need to add a custom serializer for all your array objects. Would you spend time coding up a subclass, or use composition or ... The prototype property solves this by letting the users control the exact set of members/methods available to a class. Think of prototypes as an extra vtable-pointer. When some members are missing from the original class, the prototype is looked up at runtime.","The `.prototype` property in JavaScript allows users to extend the interface of standard classes, making them more flexible and customizable. It enables the addition of custom methods or properties to existing classes, such as adding a serializer to the `Array` class, without requiring subclassing or composition.

572897,How does JavaScript .prototype work?,"Javascript doesn't have inheritance in the usual sense, but it has the prototype chain. prototype chain If a member of an object can't be found in the object it looks for it in the prototype chain. The chain consists of other objects. The prototype of a given instance can be accessed with the <code>__proto__</code> variable. Every object has one, as there is no difference between classes and instances in javascript. The advantage of adding a function / variable to the prototype is that it has to be in the memory only once, not for every instance. It's also useful for inheritance, because the prototype chain can consist of many other objects.","JavaScript uses a prototype chain to achieve inheritance, where an object's missing members are searched for in its prototype chain, accessible via `__proto__`.

572897,How does JavaScript .prototype work?,"Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]]. If you look up a property via <code>obj.propName</code> or <code>obj['propName']</code> and the object does not have such a property - which can be checked via <code>obj.hasOwnProperty('propName')</code> - the runtime looks up the property in the object referenced by [[Prototype]] instead. If the prototype-object also doesn't have such a property, its prototype is checked in turn, thus walking the original object's prototype-chain until a match is found or its end is reached. Some JavaScript implementations allow direct access to the [[Prototype]] property, eg via a non-standard property named <code>__proto__</code>. In general, it's only possible to set an object's prototype during object creation: If you create a new object via <code>new Func()</code>, the object's [[Prototype]] property will be set to the object referenced by <code>Func.prototype</code>. This allows to simulate classes in JavaScript, although JavaScript's inheritance system is - as we have seen - prototypical, and not class-based: Just think of constructor functions as classes and the properties of the prototype (ie of the object referenced by the constructor function's <code>prototype</code> property) as shared members, ie members which are the same for each instance. In class-based systems, methods are implemented the same way for each instance, so methods are normally added to the prototype, whereas an object's fields are instance-specific and therefore added to the object itself during construction.","In JavaScript, every object has a `[[Prototype]]` property that references another object. When a property is accessed and not found on the object itself, the runtime checks the object's prototype, and then its prototype's prototype, and so on, until a match is found or the end of the prototype chain is reached.

While the references to each object are unique in each array, once you ultimately grab onto it you're dealing with the same object as before. There is nothing wrong with the way you cloned it...  the same result would occur using Array.slice(). The reason your deep copy is having problems is because you're ending up with circular object references. Deep will go as deep as it can go, and if you've got a circle, it'll keep going infinitely until the browser faints. If the data structure cannot be represented as a directed acyclic graph, then I'm not sure you're going to be able to find an all-purpose method for deep cloning. Cyclic graphs provide many tricky corner cases, and since it's not a common operation I doubt anyone has written a full solution (if it's even possible - it might not be!

614818,"What is the difference between public, private, protected, and having no access modifier?","Hmm. See here:  Access Modifiers. In a nutshell: Public gives the method or type complete visibility from other types/classes. Private allows only the type containing the private method/variable access to the private method/variable (note that nested classes  also have access to the containing classes private methods/variables). Protected is similar to private except derived classes can also access protected methods. ""Nothing"" is VB.NET's equivalent to null. Although if you're referring to ""nothing"" meaning ""no access modifier"", then it depends, although a very rough rule of thumb (certainly in C#) is that if you don't explicitly specify an access modifier, the method/variable declaration is usually as <em>restricted</em> as it can be.i.e. is effectively the same as: The linked MSDN article will offer a fully description when there's no access modifier explicitly specified.","The main differences between public, private, and protected access modifiers are: 
- Public provides complete visibility to all types/classes.
- Private allows access only to the containing type and nested classes.
- Protected is similar to private but also allows access to derived classes.
- Having no access modifier restricts access as much as possible, with the exact behavior depending on the language (e.g., in C#, it defaults to the most restrictive access level).",,"In a nutshell: Public gives the method or type complete visibility from other types/classes.

614818,"What is the difference between public, private, protected, and having no access modifier?","Access modifiers <strong>public</strong> The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it. <strong>private</strong> The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct. <strong>protected</strong> The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or struct, or in a derived class. <strong>internal</strong> The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly. <strong>protected internal</strong> The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, or by any derived class in another assembly. When <strong>no access modifier</strong> is set, a default access modifier is used. So there is always some form of access modifier even if it's not set. <strong>Static</strong> The static modifier on a class means that the class cannot be instantiated, and that all of its members are static. A static member has one version regardless of how many instances of its enclosing type are created. A static class is basically the same as a non-static class, but there is one difference: a static class cannot be externally instantiated. In other words, you cannot use the new keyword to create a variable of the class type. Because there is no instance variable, you access the members of a static class by using the class name itself. However, there is a such thing as a static constructor. Any class can have one of these, including static classes. They cannot be called directly &amp; cannot have parameters (other than any type parameters on the class itself). A static constructor is called automatically to initialize the class before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced.

592620,How to check if a program exists from a Bash script?,"Answer POSIX compatible: For <code>bash</code> specific environments: Explanation Avoid <code>which</code>. Not only is it an external process you're launching for doing very little (meaning builtins like <code>hash</code>, <code>type</code> or <code>command</code> are way cheaper), you can also rely on the builtins to actually do what you want, while the effects of external commands can easily vary from system to system. Why care? Many operating systems have a <code>which</code> that doesn't even set an exit status, meaning the <code>if which foo</code> won't even work there and will always report that <code>foo</code> exists, even if it doesn't (note that some POSIX shells appear to do this for <code>hash</code> too). Many operating systems make <code>which</code> do custom and evil stuff like change the output or even hook into the package manager. So, don't use <code>which</code>. Instead use one of these: (Minor side-note: some will suggest <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> is the same <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code> but shorter Ã¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?this is untrue. <code>2&gt;&amp;-</code> closes FD 2 which causes an error in the program when it tries to write to stderr, which is very different from successfully writing to it and discarding the output (and dangerous!)) If your hash bang is <code>/bin/sh</code> then you should care about what POSIX says. <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code>'s exit codes aren't terribly well defined by POSIX, and <code>hash</code> is seen to exit successfully when the command doesn't exist (haven't seen this with <code>type</code> yet). <code>command</code>'s exit status is well defined by POSIX, so that one is probably the safest to use. If your script uses <code>bash</code> though, POSIX rules don't really matter anymore and both <code>type</code> and <code>hash</code> become perfectly safe to use. <code>type</code> now has a <code>-P</code> to search just the <code>PATH</code> and <code>hash</code> has the side-effect that the command's location will be hashed (for faster lookup next time you use it), which is usually a good thing since you probably check for its existence in order to actually use it. As a simple example, here's a function that runs <code>gdate</code> if it exists, otherwise <code>date</code>:","To check if a program exists from a Bash script, avoid using `which` due to its variability across systems and potential to not set an exit status. Instead, use built-in commands like `hash`, `type`, or `command`. For POSIX-compatible environments, `command` is the safest option, while in Bash-specific environments, `type` and `hash` are also safe to use. For example, you can use `if type -P gdate; then gdate; else date; fi` to run `gdate` if it exists, or `date` otherwise.","POSIX compatible: For <code>bash</code> specific environments: Avoid <code>which</code>.

295579,Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer,"Project Euler is mentioned in the tags and many of the problems in it require checking numbers >> 2^64. Most of the optimizations mentioned above don't work easily when you are working with an 80 byte buffer. I used java BigInteger and a slightly modified version of Newton's method, one that works better with integers. The problem was that exact squares n^2 converged to (n-1) instead of n because n^2-1 = (n-1)(n+1) and the final error was just one step below the final divisor and the algorithm terminated. It was easy to fix by adding one to the original argument before computing the error. (Add two for cube roots, etc.) One nice attribute of this algorithm is that you can immediately tell if the number is a perfect square - the final error (not correction) in Newton's method will be zero. A simple modification also lets you quickly calculate floor(sqrt(x)) instead of the closest integer. This is handy with several Euler problems.","To determine if an integer's square root is an integer, especially for large numbers, a modified version of Newton's method using Java BigInteger can be used. This approach involves adding 1 to the original number before computing the error to ensure convergence to the correct value, and it allows for immediate identification of perfect squares and calculation of floor(sqrt(x)).","I used java BigInteger and a slightly modified version of Newton's method, one that works better with integers.","I used java BigInteger and a slightly modified version of Newton's method, one that works better with integers.

310634,"What is the ""right"" way to iterate through an array in Ruby?","I'm not saying that <code>Array</code> -> <code>|value,index|</code> and <code>Hash</code> -> <code>|key,value|</code> is not insane (see Horace Loeb's comment), but I am saying that there is a sane way to expect this arrangement. When I am dealing with arrays, I am focused on the elements in the array (not the index because the index is transitory). The method is each with index, i.e. each+index, or |each,index|, or <code>|value,index|</code>. This is also consistent with the index being viewed as an optional argument, e.g. |value| is equivalent to |value,index=nil| which is consistent with |value,index|. When I am dealing with hashes, I am often more focused on the keys than the values, and I am usually dealing with keys and values in that order, either <code>key =&gt; value</code> or <code>hash[key] = value</code>. If you want duck-typing, then either explicitly use a defined method as Brent Longborough showed, or an implicit method as maxhawkins showed. Ruby is all about accommodating the language to suit the programmer, not about the programmer accommodating to suit the language. This is why there are so many ways. There are so many ways to think about something. In Ruby, you choose the closest and the rest of the code usually falls out extremely neatly and concisely. As for the original question, ""What is the __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through an array in Ruby? "", well, I think the core way (i.e. without powerful syntactic sugar or object oriented power) is to do: But Ruby is all about powerful syntactic sugar and object oriented power, but anyway here is the equivalent for hashes, and the keys can be ordered or not: So, my answer is, ""The __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through an array in Ruby depends on you (i.e. the programmer or the programming team) and the project."". The better Ruby programmer makes the better choice (of which syntactic power and/or which object oriented approach). The better Ruby programmer continues to look for more ways. Now, I want to ask another question, ""What is the __ightÃ¨ÂÂÃ©Â©Â´?way to iterate through a Range in Ruby backwards?""! (This question is how I came to this page.) It is nice to do (for the forwards): but I don't like to do (for the backwards): Well, I don't actually mind doing that too much, but when I am teaching going backwards, I want to show my students a nice symmetry (i.e. with minimal difference, e.g. only adding a reverse, or a step -1, but without modifying anything else). You can do (for symmetry): and which I don't like much, but you can't do You could ultimately do but I want to teach pure Ruby rather than object oriented approaches (just yet). I would like to iterate backwards: without creating an array (consider 0..1000000000) working for any Range (e.g. Strings, not just Integers) without using any extra object oriented power (i.e. no class modification) I believe this is impossible without defining a <code>pred</code> method, which means modifying the Range class to use it. If you can do this please let me know, otherwise confirmation of impossibility would be appreciated though it would be disappointing. Perhaps Ruby 1.9 addresses this. (Thanks for your time in reading this.)","The ""right"" way to iterate through an array in Ruby depends on the programmer and the project.

For example: In order to avoid having to use the <code>enum</code> keyword everywhere, a typedef can be created: This can be simplified into one line: And finally, if we don't need to be able to use <code>enum tagname</code> with the <code>enum</code> keyword, we can make the <code>enum</code> anonymous and only declare it with the typedef name: Now, in this case, we're declaring <code>ShapeType</code> to be a typedef'ed name of an anonymous enumeration. <code>ShapeType</code> is really just an integral type, and should only be used to declare variables which hold one of the values listed in the declaration (that is, one of <code>kCircle</code>, <code>kRectangle</code>, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code>). You can assign a <code>ShapeType</code> variable another value by casting, though, so you have to be careful when reading enum values. Finally, <code>kCircle</code>, <code>kRectangle</code>, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code> are declared as integral constants in the global namespace. Since no specific values were specified, they get assigned to consecutive integers starting with 0, so <code>kCircle</code> is 0, <code>kRectangle</code> is 1, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code> is 2.","A `typedef enum` in Objective-C declares an anonymous enumeration type and assigns a new name to it. It creates a set of named integral constants and allows for a more concise way of referencing the enumeration type without needing the `enum` keyword. The `typedef` name is essentially an alias for an integral type, and the named constants are assigned consecutive integer values starting from 0.","Three things are being declared here: an anonymous enumerated type is declared, <code>ShapeType</code> is being declared a typedef for that anonymous enumeration, and the three names <code>kCircle</code>, <code>kRectangle</code>, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code> are being declared as integral constants. In order to avoid having to use the <code>enum</code> keyword everywhere, a typedef can be created:","Three things are being declared here: an anonymous enumerated type is declared, <code>ShapeType</code> is being declared a typedef for that anonymous enumeration, and the three names <code>kCircle</code>, <code>kRectangle</code>, and <code>kOblateSpheroid</code> are being declared as integral constants."
544010,Difference between div id and div class,"Where to use an ID versus a class The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. Therefore, it is appropriate to use an ID on the div element that is marking up the main content on the page, as there will only be one main content section. In contrast, you must use a class to set up alternating row colors on a table, as they are by definition going to be used more than once. IDs are an incredibly powerful tool. An element with an ID can be the target of a piece of JavaScript that manipulates the element or its contents in some way. The ID attribute can be used as the target of an internal link, replacing anchor tags with name attributes. Finally, if you make your IDs clear and logical, they can serve as a sort of Ã©ÂÂ¥Ã¦Â¸Âelf documentationÃ©Â?within the document. For example, you do not necessarily need to add a comment before a block stating that a block of code will contain the main content if the opening tag of the block has an ID of, say, ""main"", ""header"", ""footer"", etc.","The main difference between `div id` and `div class` is that an ID can only be used once per page, whereas a class can be used multiple times. Use an ID for unique elements, such as a main content section, and a class for repeated elements, like alternating table row colors. IDs are also useful for JavaScript targeting, internal linking, and self-documentation within the HTML document.","Where to use an ID versus a class The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page.","The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page.

761194,Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO),"From another answer of mine, mostly dealing with when to use one versus the other: In my experience, interfaces are best  used when you have several classes  which each need to respond to the same  method or methods so that they can be  used interchangeably by other code  which will be written against those  classes' common interface. The best  use of an interface is when the  protocol is important but the  underlying logic may be different for  each class.

722651,How do I pass multiple parameters in Objective-C?,"Yes; the Objective-C method syntax is like this for a couple of reasons; one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying are. For example, if you are adding an object to an <code>NSMutableArray</code> at a certain index, you would do it using the method: BIGBLOCK This method is called <code>insertObject:atIndex:</code> and it is clear that an object is being inserted at a specified index. In practice, adding a string ""Hello, World!"" at index 5 of an <code>NSMutableArray</code> called <code>array</code> would be called as follows: BIGBLOCK This also reduces ambiguity between the order of the method parameters, ensuring that you pass the object parameter first, <em>then</em> the index parameter. This becomes more useful when using functions that take a large number of arguments, and reduces error in passing the arguments. Furthermore, the method naming convention is such because Objective-C doesn't support overloading; however, if you want to write a method that does the same job, but takes different data-types, this can be accomplished; take, for instance, the <code>NSNumber</code> class; this has several object creation methods, including: <li><code>+ (id)numberWithBool:(BOOL)value;</code> <li><code>+ (id)numberWithFloat:(float)value;</code> <li><code>+ (id)numberWithDouble:(double)value;</code> In a language such as C++, you would simply overload the number method to allow different data types to be passed as the argument; however, in Objective-C, this syntax allows several different variants of the same function to be implemented, by changing the name of the method for each variant of the function.","In Objective-C, multiple parameters are passed using a specific method syntax that clearly indicates the purpose of each parameter, reducing ambiguity and errors. This syntax is necessary because Objective-C does not support method overloading, but instead uses distinct method names to accommodate different data types.

However, you do have a couple of options: Return a structure that contains multiple members Return an instance of a class Use output parameters (using the out or ref keywords) Use a dictionary or key-value pair as output The pros and cons here are often hard to figure out. If you return a structure, make sure it's small because structs are value type and passed on the stack. If you return an instance of a class, there are some design patterns here that you might want to use to avoid causing problems - members of classes can be modified because C# passes objects by reference (you don't have ByVal like you did in VB). Finally you can use output parameters but I would limit the use of this to scenarios when you only have a couple (like 3 or less) of parameters - otherwise things get ugly and hard to maintain. Also, the use of output parameters can be an inhibitor to agility because your method signature will have to change every time you need to add something to the return value whereas returning a struct or class instance you can add members without modifying the method signature. From an architectural standpoint I would recommend against using key-value pairs or dictionaries. I find this style of coding requires ""secret knowledge"" in code that consumes the method.

761194,Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO),"While your question indicates it's for ""general OO"", it really seems to be focusing on .NET use of these terms. In .NET (similar for Java): <li>interfaces can have no state or implementation <li>a class that implements an interface must provide an implementation of all the methods of that interface <li>abstract classes may contain state (data members) and/or implementation (methods) <li>abstract classes can be inherited without implementing the abstract methods (though such a derived class is abstract itself) <li>interfaces may be multiple-inherited, abstract classes may not (this is probably the key concrete reason for interfaces to exist separately from abtract classes - they permit an implementation of multiple inheritance that removes many of the problems of general MI). As general OO terms, the differences are not necessarily well-defined. For example, there are C++ programmers who may hold similar rigid definitions (interfaces are a strict subset of abstract classes that cannot contain implementation), while some may say that an abstract class with some default implementations is still an interface or that a non-abstract class can still define an interface. Indeed, there is a C++ idiom called the Non-Virtual Interface (NVI) where  the public methods are non-virtual methods that 'thunk' to private virtual methods: <li>http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm <li>http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Non-Virtual_Interface","In object-oriented programming (OO), the key differences between interfaces and abstract classes are: 
1. Interfaces have no state or implementation, while abstract classes can contain state and/or implementation.
2. A class implementing an interface must provide an implementation for all its methods, whereas abstract classes can be inherited without implementing all abstract methods.
3. Interfaces support multiple inheritance, whereas abstract classes do not. However, the definitions of these terms can vary across programming languages, such as between .NET, Java, and C++.","<li>a class that implements an interface must provide an implementation of all the methods of that interface As general OO terms, the differences are not necessarily well-defined.","<li>interfaces can have no state or implementation <li>a class that implements an interface must provide an implementation of all the methods of that interface <li>abstract classes may contain state (data members) and/or implementation (methods) <li>abstract classes can be inherited without implementing the abstract methods (though such a derived class is abstract itself) <li>interfaces may be multiple-inherited, abstract classes may not (this is probably the key concrete reason for interfaces to exist separately from abtract classes - they permit an implementation of multiple inheritance that removes many of the problems of general MI).

This restricts what can be done in the function, but allows it to be used in-line in the query if it is defined to be ""pure"". Otherwise, a function (not necessarily deterministic) can return a variable or a result set. In the case of a function returning a result set, you can join it against some other selection in a query. However, you cannot use a non-deterministic function like this in a correlated subquery as the optimiser cannot predict what sort of result set will be returned (this is computationally intractable, like the halting problem).","In PL/SQL, the main difference between a function and a procedure is that a function can be used inline in a SQL statement, provided it is deterministic (i.e., always returns the same output for the same inputs), whereas a procedure cannot.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"The problems with singletons is the issue of increased scope and therefore coupling. There is no denying that there are some of situations where you do need access to a single instance, and it can be accomplished other ways. I now prefer to design around an inversion of control (IoC) container and allow the the lifetimes to be controlled by the container. This gives you the benefit of the classes that depend on the instance to be unaware of the fact that there is a single instance. The lifetime of the singleton can be changed in the future. Once such example I encountered recently was an easy adjustment from single threaded to multi-threaded. FWIW, if it a PIA when you try to unit test it then it's going to PIA when you try to debug, bug fix or enhance it.","Singletons are problematic due to increased scope and coupling, but their functionality can be achieved through alternative methods, such as using an Inversion of Control (IoC) container, which allows for more flexibility and easier testing, debugging, and maintenance.",The problems with singletons is the issue of increased scope and therefore coupling.,The problems with singletons is the issue of increased scope and therefore coupling.
137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"Firstly a class and its collaborators should firstly perform their intended purpose rather than focusing on deoendents. Lifecycle management (when instances are creared snd when they go out of scope) should not be part of the cladses responsibility. The accepted best practice for this is to craft or configure a new component to manage dependencies using dependency injection. Often software gets more complicated it makes sense to have multiple independent instances of the ""singleton"" class with different state. Committing code to simply grab the singleton is wrong in such cases. Using Singleton.getInstance() might be ok for small simple systems but it doesn't work / scale when one might need a different instance of the same class. No class should be thought of as a singleton but rather that should be an aplication of it's usage or how it is used to configure dependents. For a quick and nasty this does not matter- just luke hardcoding say file paths does not matter but for bigger applications such dependencies need to be factored out and managed in more appropriate way using DI. The problems that singleton cause in testing is a symptom of their hard coded single usage case/environment. The test suite and the many tests are each individual and separate something that is not compatible with hardcoding a singleton.","Singletons are considered bad practice because they conflate a class's purpose with lifecycle management and dependency handling, making it inflexible and hard to scale.

However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur. By default, the task execution thread does not run as a daemon thread, so it is capable of keeping an application from terminating. If a caller wants to terminate a timer's task execution thread rapidly, the caller should invoke the timer's cancel method..."" I would like to call cancel upon the class owning the Timer losing its last reference(or immeditalesky before). Here a reliable destructor could do that for me. The comments above indicate that finally is a poor choice, but is there an elegant solution? That business of ""...capable of keeping an application from terminating..."" is not appealing.","In Java, there is no traditional destructor like in other languages. However, to ensure a `Timer` object's task execution thread terminates when the owning class loses its last reference, you can use a `finally` block or the `cancel` method, but a more elegant solution is needed as `finally` is not reliable and there is no direct equivalent of a destructor.",,

35837,What is the Difference Between Mercurial and Git?,"I work on Mercurial, but fundamentally I believe both systems are equivalent. They both work with the same abstractions: a series of snapshots (changesets) which make up the history. Each changeset knows where it came from (the parent changeset) and can have many child changesets. The recent hg-git extension provides a two-way bridge between Mercurial and Git and sort of shows this point. Git has a strong focus on mutating this history graph (with all the consequences that entails) whereas Mercurial does not encourage history rewriting, but it's easy to do anyway and the consequences of doing so are exactly what you should expect them to be (that is, if I modify a changeset you already have, your client will see it as new if you pull from me). So Mercurial has a <em>bias</em> towards non-destructive commands. As for light-weight branches, then Mercurial has supported repositories with <em>multiple branches</em> since..., always I think. Git repositories with multiple branches are exactly that: multiple diverged strands of development in a single repository. Git then adds names to these strands and allow you to query these names remotely. The Bookmarks extension for Mercurial adds local names, and with Mercurial 1.6, you can move these bookmarks around when you push/pull.. I use Linux, but apparently TortoiseHg is faster and better than the Git equivalent on Windows (due to better usage of the poor Windows filesystem). Both http://github.com and http://bitbucket.org provide online hosting, the service at Bitbucket is great and responsive (I haven't tried github). I chose Mercurial since it feels clean and elegant -- I was put off by the shell/Perl/Ruby scripts I got with Git. Try taking a peek at the <code>git-instaweb.sh</code> file if you want to know what I mean: it is a <strong>shell</strong> script which generates a <strong>Ruby</strong> script, which I think runs a webserver. The shell script generates another shell script to launch the first Ruby script. There is also a bit of <strong>Perl</strong>, for good measure. I like the blog post that compares Mercurial and Git with James Bond and MacGyver -- Mercurial is somehow more low-key than Git. It seems to me, that people using Mercurial are not so easily impressed. This is reflected in how each system do what Linus described as ""the coolest merge EVER!"". In Git you can merge with an unrelated repository by doing: Those commands look quite arcane to my eye. In Mercurial we do: Notice how the Mercurial commands are plain and not special at all -- the only unusual thing is the <code>--force</code> flag to <code>hg pull</code>, which is needed since Mercurial will abort otherwise when you pull from an unrelated repository. It is differences like this that makes Mercurial seem more elegant to me.","The main difference between Mercurial and Git is their approach to handling history and branching. Both systems use similar abstractions, but Git focuses on mutating the history graph, while Mercurial encourages non-destructive commands and has a bias towards preserving history. Mercurial also has a more straightforward and elegant approach to tasks like merging and branching, with simpler commands and fewer scripts involved.

894490,SQL left join vs multiple tables on FROM line?,"The old syntax, with just listing the tables, and using the <code>WHERE</code> clause to specify the join criteria, is being deprecated in most modern databases. It's not just for show, the old syntax has the possibility of being ambiguous when you use both INNER and OUTER joins in the same query. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose you have 3 tables in your system: BIGBLOCK Each table contain numerous rows, linked together. You got multiple companies, and each company can have multiple departments, and each department can have multiple employees. Ok, so now you want to do the following: List all the companies, and include all their departments, and all their employees. Note that some companies don't have any departments yet, but make sure you include them as well. Make sure you only retrieve departments that have employees, but always list all companies. So you do this: BIGBLOCK Note that the last one there is an inner join, in order to fulfill the criteria that you only want departments with people. Ok, so what happens now. Well, the problem is, it depends on the database engine, the query optimizer, indexes, and table statistics. Let me explain. If the query optimizer determines that the way to do this is to first take a company, then find the departments, and then do an inner join with employees, you're not going to get any companies that don't have departments. The reason for this is that the <code>WHERE</code> clause determines which <em>rows</em> end up in the final result, not individual parts of the rows. And in this case, due to the left join, the Department.ID column will be NULL, and thus when it comes to the INNER JOIN to Employee, there's no way to fulfill that constraint for the Employee row, and so it won't appear. On the other hand, if the query optimizer decides to tackle the department-employee join first, and then do a left join with the companies, you will see them. So the old syntax is ambiguous. There's no way to specify what you want, without dealing with query hints, and some databases have no way at all. Enter the new syntax, with this you can choose. For instance, if you want all companies, as the problem description stated, this is what you would write: BIGBLOCK Here you specify that you want the department-employee join to be done as one join, and then left join the results of that with the companies. Additionally, let's say you only want departments that contains the letter X in their name. Again, with old style joins, you risk losing the company as well, if it doesn't have any departments with an X in its name, but with the new syntax, you can do this: BIGBLOCK This extra clause is used for the joining, but is not a filter for the entire row. So the row might appear with company information, but might have NULLs in all the department and employee columns for that row, because there is no department with an X in its name for that company. This is hard with the old syntax. This is why, amongst other vendors, Microsoft has deprecated the old outer join syntax, but not the old inner join syntax, since SQL Server 2005 and upwards. The only way to talk to a database running on Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or 2008, using the old style outer join syntax, is to set that database in 8.0 compatibility mode (aka SQL Server 2000). Additionally, the old way, by throwing a bunch of tables at the query optimizer, with a bunch of WHERE clauses, was akin to saying ""here you are, do the best you can"". With the new syntax, the query optimizer has less work to do in order to figure out what parts goes together. So there you have it. LEFT and INNER JOIN is the wave of the future.","The old SQL syntax of listing tables in the `FROM` clause and specifying join criteria in the `WHERE` clause is being deprecated due to its ambiguity, especially when combining inner and outer joins.

You can remove the try/catch block from <code>encrypt</code> and add <code>throws Exception</code> and the exception handling block to your <code>actionPerformed</code> method. It's generally better to handle an exception at the lowest level that you can, instead of passing it up to a higher level. The second error just means that you need to add a return statement to whichever method contains line 109 (also <code>encrypt</code>, in this case). There is a return statement in the method, but if an exception is thrown it might not be reached, so you either need to return in the catch block, or remove the try/catch from <code>encrypt</code>, as I mentioned before.","The ""Exception; must be caught or declared to be thrown"" error occurs when a method throws an exception that is not handled or declared.

One example of when this might be useful that comes to mind is, variables that make only sense in the context of a specific object instance and which become invalid once you have serialized and deserialized the object.

From the Java Language Specification, Java SE 7 Edition, Section 8.3.1.3. <code>transient</code> Fields: Variables may be marked <code>transient</code> to  indicate that they are not part of the  persistent state of an object. For example, you may have fields that are derived from other fields, and should only be done so programmatically, rather than having the state be persisted via serialization. Here's a <code>GalleryImage</code> class which contains an image and a thumbnail derived from the image: In this example, the <code>thumbnailImage</code> is a thumbnail image that is generated by invoking the <code>generateThumbnail</code> method. The <code>thumbnailImage</code> field is marked as <code>transient</code>, so only the original <code>image</code> is serialized rather than persisting both the original image and the thumbnail image. This means that less storage would be needed to save the serialized object. (Of course, this may or may not be desirable depending on the requirements of the system -- this is just an example.) At the time of deserialization, the <code>readObject</code> method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object back to the state at which the serialization occurred. Here, the thumbnail needs to be generated, so the <code>readObject</code> method is overridden so that the thumbnail will be generated by calling the <code>generateThumbnail</code> method. For additional information, the Discover the secrets of the Java Serialization API article (which was originally available on the Sun Developer Network) has a section which discusses the use of and presents a scenario where the <code>transient</code> keyword is used to prevent serialization of certain fields.","The `transient` keyword in Java is used to prevent a field from being serialized, indicating that it's not part of an object's persistent state.

At this point is is probably best to imagine that the ""App Server"" product category is a strict superset of the ""web server"" category. Some history. In early days of the Mosaic browser and hyperlinked content, there evolved this thing called a ""web server"" that served web page content and images over HTTP. Most of the content was static, and the HTTP 1.0 protocol was just a way to ship files around. Quickly the ""web server"" category evolved to include CGI capability - effectively launching a process on each web request to generate dynamic content. HTTP also matured and the products became more sophisticated, with caching, security, and management features. As the technology matured, we got company-specific Java-based server-side technology from Kiva and NetDynamics, which eventually all merged into JSP. Microsoft added ASP, I think in 1996, to Windows NT 4.0. The static web server had learned some new tricks, so that it was an effective ""app server"" for many scenarios. In a parallel category, the app server had evolved and existed for a long time. companies delivered products for Unix like Tuxedo, TopEnd, Encina that were philosophically derived from Mainframe application management and monitoring environments like IMS and CICS. Microsoft's offering was Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), which later evolved into COM+. Most of these products specified ""closed"" product-specific communications protocols to interconnect ""fat"" clients to servers. (For Encina, the comms protocol was DCE RPC; for MTS it was DCOM; etc.) In 1995/96, these traditional app server products began to embed basic HTTP communication capability, at first via gateways. And the lines began to blur. Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads, more concurrency, and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability. At this point the line between ""app server"" and ""web server"" is a fuzzy one. But people continue to use the terms differently, as a matter of emphasis. When someone says ""web server"" you often think HTTP-centric, web UI, oriented apps. When someone says ""App server"" you may think ""heavier loads, enterprise features, transactions and queuing, multi-channel communication (HTTP + more). But often it is the same product that serves both sets of workload requirements. <li>WebSphere, IBM's ""app server"" has its own bundled web server. <li>WebLogic, another traditional app server, likewise. <li>Windows, which is Microsoft's App Server (in addition to being its File&amp;Print Server, Media Server, etc. ), bundles IIS.","The distinction between an application server and a web server has become blurred over time. Historically, web servers served static content over HTTP, while application servers managed more complex, dynamic applications. However, as technology evolved, web servers gained features like CGI, caching, and security, while application servers began to support HTTP communication. Today, the terms are often used interchangeably, with ""web server"" emphasizing HTTP-centric, web UI-oriented apps, and ""application server"" implying heavier loads, enterprise features, and multi-channel communication.

You say you have the unlimited jurisdiction patch installed, so the AES-256 cipher should be supported (but then 256-bit keys should be too, so this might be a configuration problem). A workaround for lack of AES-256 support is to take some freely available implementation of AES-256, and use it as a custom provider. This involves creating your own <code>Provider</code> subclass and using it with <code>Cipher.getInstance(String, Provider)</code>.

Then to derive a good key from this information: The magic numbers (which could be defined as constants somewhere) 65536 and 256 are the key derivation iteration count and the key size, respectively. The key derivation function is iterated to require significant computational effort, and that prevents attackers from quickly trying many different passwords. The iteration count can be changed depending on the computing resources available. The key size can be reduced to 128 bits, which is still considered ""strong"" encryption, but it doesn't give much of a safety margin if attacks are discovered that weaken AES. Used with a proper block-chaining mode, the same derived key can be used to encrypt many messages. In CBC, a random initialization vector (IV) is generated for each message, yielding different cipher text even if the plain text is identical. CBC may not be the most secure mode available to you (see AEAD below); there are many other modes with different security properties, but they all use a similar random input. In any case, the outputs of each encryption operation are the cipher text and the initialization vector: Store the <code>ciphertext</code> and the <code>iv</code>. On decryption, the <code>SecretKey</code> is regenerated in exactly the same way, using using the password with the same salt and iteration parameters. Initialize the cipher with this key and the initialization vector stored with the message: Java 7 included API support for AEAD cipher modes, and the ""SunJCE"" provider included with OpenJDK and Oracle distributions implements these beginning with Java 8. One of these modes is strongly recommended in place of CBC; it will protect the integrity of the data as well as their privacy. A <code>java.security.InvalidKeyException</code> with the message ""Illegal key size or default parameters"" means that the cryptography strength is limited; the unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files are not in the correct location. In a JDK, they should be placed under <code>${jdk}/jre/lib/security</code> Based on the problem description, it sounds like the policy files are not correctly installed.

1028250,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external ""stimuli"" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations. This is pretty well suited to UI design, for example, in which touching a user interface control (say, the volume control on a music playing application) might need to update various display items and the actual volume of audio output. When you modify the volume (a slider, let's say) that would correspond to modifying the value associated with a node in a directed graph. Various nodes having edges from that ""volume value"" node would automatically be triggered and any necessary computations and updates would naturally ripple through the application. The application ""reacts"" to the user stimulus. Functional reactive programming would just be the implementation of this idea in a functional language, or generally within a functional programming paradigm. For more on ""dataflow computing"", search for those two words on Wikipedia or using your favorite search engine. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs ""triggered"" or ""marked"". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. The graph might be implicit or explicit depending on exactly how reactive programming is implemented. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Dataflow computing is fairly well suited to situations in which triggering computations asynchronously giving rise to cascades of computations works better than trying to have execution be governed by a clock (or clocks). Reactive programming imports this ""cascade of execution"" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the ""outside world"" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. Program execution would then look like something analogous to a complex reflex arc. The program may or may not be basically sessile between stimuli or may settle into a basically sessile state between stimuli. ""non-reactive"" programming would be programming with a very different view of the flow of execution and relationship to external inputs. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs ""reacts"" to them. But looking at the spirit of the thing, a program that polls an event queue at a fixed interval and dispatches any events found to functions (or threads) is less reactive (because it only attends to user input at a fixed interval). Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.","Reactive programming is a paradigm that involves a directed graph of nodes, where each node performs a computation and is triggered by external stimuli, such as user input. When a node is triggered, it automatically updates dependent nodes, creating a cascade of executions. This approach is well-suited for UI design and event-driven systems, and can be implemented in a functional programming paradigm, known as functional reactive programming. It differs from traditional programming in that it responds to external inputs in a more dynamic and asynchronous manner, rather than relying on a fixed clock or polling interval.","The application ""reacts"" to the user stimulus.

1028250,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"In pure functional programming, there are no side-effects. For many types of software (for example, anything with user interaction) side-effects are necessary at some level. One way to get side-effect like behavior while still retaining a functional style is to use functional reactive programming. This is the combination of functional programming, and reactive programming. (The Wikipedia article you linked to is about the latter.) The basic idea behind reactive programming is that there are certain datatypes that represent a value ""over time"". Computations that involve these changing-over-time values will themselves have values that change over time. For example, you could represent the mouse coordinates as a pair of integer-over-time values. Let's say we had something like (this is pseudo-code): BIGBLOCK At any moment in time, x and y would have the coordinates of the mouse. Unlike non-reactive programming, we only need to make this assignment once, and the x and y variables will stay ""up to date"" automatically. This is why reactive programming and functional programming work so well together: reactive programming removes the need to mutate variables while still letting you do a lot of what you could accomplish with variable mutations. If we then do some computations based on this the resulting values will also be values that change over time. For example: BIGBLOCK In this example, <code>minX</code> will always be 16 less than the x coordinate of the mouse pointer. With reactive-aware libraries you could then say something like: BIGBLOCK And a 32x32 box will be drawn around the mouse pointer and will track it wherever it moves. Here is a pretty good paper on functional reactive programming.","Functional reactive programming combines functional programming and reactive programming, allowing for side-effect-like behavior without mutating variables.

1028250,What is (functional) reactive programming?,"If you want to get a feel for FRP, you could start with the old Fran tutorial from 1998, which has animated illustrations. For papers, start with <em>Functional Reactive Animation</em> and then follow up on links on the publications link on my home page and the FRP link on the Haskell wiki. Personally, I like to think about what FRP <em>means</em> before addressing how it might be implemented. (Code without a specification is an answer without a question and thus ""not even wrong"". )So I don't describe FRP in representation/implementation terms as Thomas K does in another answer (graphs, nodes, edges, firing, execution, etc).There are many possible implementation styles, but no implementation says what FRP <em>is</em>. I do resonate with Laurence G's simple description that FRP is about ""datatypes that represent a value 'over time' "".Conventional imperative programming captures these dynamic values only indirectly, through state and mutations.The complete history (past, present, future) has no first class representation.Moreover, only <em>discretely evolving</em> values can be (indirectly) captured, since the imperative paradigm is temporally discrete.In contrast, FRP captures these evolving values <em>directly</em> and has no difficulty with <em>continuously</em> evolving values. FRP is also unusual in that it is concurrent without running afoul of the theoretical &amp; pragmatic rats' nest that plagues imperative concurrency.Semantically, FRP's concurrency is <em>fine-grained</em>, <em>determinate</em>, and <em>continuous</em>. (I'm talking about meaning, not implementation. An implementation may or may not involve concurrency or parallelism. )Semantic determinacy is very important for reasoning, both rigorous and informal.While concurrency adds enormous complexity to imperative programming (due to nondeterministic interleaving), it is effortless in FRP. So, what is FRP?You could have invented it yourself.Start with these ideas: <li>Dynamic/evolving values (i.e., values ""over time"") are first class values in themselves. You can define them and combine them, pass them into &amp; out of functions. I called these things ""behaviors"". <li>Behaviors are built up out of a few primitives, like constant (static) behaviors and time (like a clock), and then with sequential and parallel combination. <em>n</em> behaviors are combined by applying an n-ary function (on static values), ""point-wise"", i.e., continuously over time. <li>To account for discrete phenomena, have another type (family) of ""events"", each of which has a stream (finite or infinite) of occurrences. Each occurrence has an associated time and value. <li>To come up with the compositional vocabulary out of which all behaviors and events can be built, play with some examples. Keep deconstructing into pieces that are more general/simple. <li>So that you know you're on solid ground, give the whole model a compositional foundation, using the technique of denotational semantics, which just means that (a) each type has a corresponding simple &amp; precise mathematical type of ""meanings"", and (b) each primitive and operator has a simple &amp; precise meaning as a function of the meanings of the constituents.<em>Never, ever</em> mix implementation considerations into your exploration process. If this description is gibberish to you, consult (a) <em>Denotational design with type class morphisms</em>, (b) <em>Push-pull functional reactive programming</em> (ignoring the implementation bits), and (c) the <em>Denotational Semantics</em> Haskell wikibooks page. Beware that denotational semantics has two parts, from its two founders Christopher Strachey and Dana Scott: the easier &amp; more useful Strachey part and the harder and less useful (for software design) Scott part. If you stick with these principles, I expect you'll get something more-or-less in the spirit of FRP. Where did I get these principles? In software design, I always ask the same question: ""what does it mean? "".Denotational semantics gave me a precise framework for this question, and one that fits my aesthetics (unlike operational or axiomatic semantics, both of which leave me unsatisfied).So I asked myself what is behavior?I soon realized that the temporally discrete nature of imperative computation is an accommodation to a particular style of <em>machine</em>, rather than a natural description of behavior itself.The simplest precise description of behavior I can think of is simply ""function of (continuous) time"", so that's my model.Delightfully, this model handles continuous, deterministic concurrency with ease and grace. It's been quite a challenge to implement this model correctly and efficiently, but that's another story.","Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm that treats dynamic values that change over time as first-class citizens, allowing for direct and continuous representation of evolving values.

It's used to define a common interface or abstract class with shared rules, while enabling concrete classes to provide unique implementations, much like musicians playing a musical script in their own style.",Let's use an analogy. For a given musical script every musician which plays it gives her own touch in the interpretation.,
1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","In Object Oriented languages, polymorphism allows treatment and handling of different data types through the same interface. For example, consider inheritance in C++: Class B is derived from Class A. A pointer of type A* (pointer to class A) may be used to handle both an object of class A AND an object of class B.","Polymorphism in Object Oriented languages allows for the treatment of different data types through a uniform interface, enabling a single interface to handle multiple types, such as using a base class pointer to handle both base and derived class objects.","In Object Oriented languages, polymorphism allows treatment and handling of different data types through the same interface.","In Object Oriented languages, polymorphism allows treatment and handling of different data types through the same interface."
1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","If you think about the Greek roots of the term, it should become obvious. Poly = many: polygon = many-sided, polystyrene = many styrenes (a), polyglot = many languages, and so on. Morph = change or form: morphology = study of biological form, Morpheus = the Greek god of dreams able to take any form. So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). For example, in many languages, integers and floats are implicitly polymorphic since you can add, subtract, multiply and so on, irrespective of the fact that the types are different. They're rarely considered as objects in the usual term. But, in that same way, a class like <code>BigDecimal</code> or <code>Rational</code> or <code>Imaginary</code> can also provide those operations, even though they operate on different data types. The classic example is the <code>Shape</code> class and all the classes that can inherit from it (square, circle, dodecahedron, irregular polygon, splat and so on). With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. A point shape needs only two co-ordinates (assuming it's in a two-dimensional space of course). A circle needs a center and radius. A square or rectangle needs two co-ordinates for the top left and bottom right corners and (possibly) a rotation. An irregular polygon needs a series of lines. By making the class responsible for its code as well as its data, you can achieve polymorphism. In this example, every class would have its own <code>Draw()</code> function and the client code could simply do: to get the correct behavior for any shape. This is in contrast to the old way of doing things in which the code was separate from the data, and you would have had functions such as <code>drawSquare()</code> and <code>drawCircle()</code>. Object orientation, polymorphism and inheritance are all closely-related concepts and they're vital to know. There have been many ""silver bullets"" during my long career which basically just fizzled out but the OO paradigm has turned out to be a good one. Learn it, understand it, love it - you'll be glad you did :-) (a) I originally wrote that as a joke but it turned out to be correct and, therefore, not that funny. The momomer styrene happens to be made from carbon and hydrogen, <code>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub></code>, and polystyrene is made from groups of that, <code>(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)<sub>n</sub></code>. Perhaps I should have stated that a polyp was many occurrences of the letter <code>p</code> although, now that I've had to explain the joke, even that doesn't seem funny either. Sometimes, you should just quit while you're behind :-)","Polymorphism is a programming concept that allows objects of different data types to be treated as if they were of the same type, using a common interface. It enables classes to have different underlying data and behaviors while sharing a common interface, making it possible to write code that works with various types without knowing their specific details. This is achieved through object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance, where classes can inherit properties and methods from a parent class. A classic example is a `Shape` class with subclasses like `Square`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle`, each with its own data and `Draw()` method, allowing client code",So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).,"So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).

For instance: A student object is also a person object. If you ""look"" (ie cast) at the student, you can probably ask for the student ID. You can't always do that with a person, right? (a person is not necessarily a student, thus might not have a student ID). However, a person probably has a name. A student does too. Bottom line, ""looking"" at the same object from different ""angles"" can give you different ""perspectives"" (ie different properties or methods) So this technique lets you build stuff that can be ""looked"" at from different angles. Why do we use polymorphism? For starters ... abstraction. At this point it should be enough info :)","Polymorphism is a programming technique that allows an object to be treated as multiple types, enabling different perspectives and access to various properties and methods.

1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","Generally speaking, it's the ability to interface a number of different types of object using the same or a superficially similar API. There are various forms: Function overloading: defining multiple functions with the same name and different parameter types, such as sqrt(float), sqrt(double) and sqrt(complex). In most languages that allow this, the compiler will automatically select the correct one for the type of argument being passed into it, thus this is compile-time polymorphism. Virtual methods in OOP: a method of a class can have various implementations tailored to the specifics of its subclasses; each of these is said to override the implementation given in the base class. Given an object that may be of the base class or any of its subclasses, the correct implementation is selected on the fly, thus this is run-time polymorphism. Templates: a feature of some OO languages whereby a function, class, etc. can be parameterised by a type. For example, you can define a generic ""list"" template class, and then instantiate it as ""list of integers"", ""list of strings"", maybe even ""list of lists of strings"" or the like. Generally, you write the code once for a data structure of arbitrary element type, and the compiler generates versions of it for the various element types.","Polymorphism is the ability to interact with different object types using a uniform API. It comes in forms such as function overloading, virtual methods in OOP, and templates, allowing for compile-time or run-time selection of the correct implementation based on the object type, enabling flexible and reusable code.","Generally speaking, it's the ability to interface a number of different types of object using the same or a superficially similar API.

1031273,"What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?","Polymorphism is the ability of the programmer to write methods of the same name that do different things for different types of objects, depending on the needs of those objects. For example, if you were developing a class called <code>Fraction</code> and a class called <code>ComplexNumber</code>, both of these might include a method called <code>display()</code>, but each of them would implement that method differently. In PHP, for example, you might implement it like this: Outputs: Some of the other answers seem to imply that polymorphism is used only in conjunction with inheritance; for example, maybe <code>Fraction</code> and <code>ComplexNumber</code> both implement an abstract class called <code>Number</code> that has a method <code>display()</code>, which Fraction and ComplexNumber are then both obligated to implement. But you don't need inheritance to take advantage of polymorphism. At least in dynamically-typed languages like PHP (I don't know about C++ or Java), polymorphism allows the developer to call a method without necessarily knowing the type of object ahead of time, and trusting that the correct implementation of the method will be called. For example, say the user chooses the type of <code>Number</code> created: In this case, the appropriate <code>display()</code> method will be called, even though the developer can't know ahead of time whether the user will choose a fraction or a complex number.","Polymorphism is a programming concept that allows methods with the same name to perform different actions based on the object type. It enables developers to write flexible code that can work with various object types without knowing the specific type in advance.

1074081,Hibernate Error: org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException: a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session,"I have had this error many times and it can be quite hard to track down... Basically, what hibernate is saying is that you have two objects which have the same identifier (same primary key) but they are not the same object. I would suggest you break down your code, i.e. comment out bits until the error goes away and then put the code back until it comes back and you should find the error it. It most often happens via cascading saves where there is a cascade save between object A and B, but object B has already been associated with the session but not on the same instance of B. What primary key generator are you using? The reason I ask is this error is related to how you're telling hibernate to ascertain the persistent state of an object (i.e. whether an object is persistent or not). The error could be happening because hibernate is trying to persist and object that is already persistent. In fact, if you use save hibernate will try and persist that object, and maybe there is already an object with that same primary key associated with the session. Example Assuming you have a hibernate class object for a table with 10 rows based on a primary key combination (column 1 and column 2). Now, you have removed 5 rows from the table at some point of time. Now, if you try to add the same 10 rows again, while hibernate tries to persist the objects in database, 5 rows which were already removed will be added without errors. Now the remaining 5 rows which are already existing, will throw this exception. So the easy approach would be checking if you have updated/removed any value in a table which is part of something and later are you trying to insert the same objects again","The `org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException` occurs when two objects with the same identifier (primary key) are not the same instance, often due to cascading saves or attempting to persist an already persistent object.

They only impact on the user when they want to stop your application using <code>kill</code> or Task Manager. Apart from building a caching system, there aren't that many reasons why you'd be so certain that there should only be on instance of something per process. How about a logging system? Might be better for that to be per-thread or more fine-grained so you can trace the origin of messages more automatically. How about the application's main window? It depends; maybe you'll want all the user's documents to be managed by the same process for some reason, in which case there would be multiple ""main windows"" in that process.","Singletons are problematic because they are rarely necessary, as the requirement for a single instance per process address space is uncommon and often not in the user's interest.

1177449,Best approach to remove time part of datetime in SQL Server,"I, personally, almost always use User Defined functions for this if dealing with SQL Server 2005 (or lower version), however, it should be noted that there are specific drawbacks to using UDF's, especially if applying them to WHERE clauses (see below and the comments on this answer for further details). If using SQL Server 2008 (or higher) - see below. In fact, for most databases that I create, I add these UDF's in right near the start since I know there's a 99% chance I'm going to need them sooner or later. I create one for ""date only"" &amp; ""time only"" (although the ""date only"" one is by far the most used of the two).

If using a UDF, it should be noted that you should try to avoid using the UDF as part of a WHERE clause in a query as this will greatly hinder performance of the query. The main reason for this is that using a UDF in a WHERE clause renders that clause as non-sargable, which means that SQL Server can no longer use an index with that clause in order to improve the speed of query execution. With reference to my own usage of UDF's, I'll frequently use the ""raw"" date column within the WHERE clause, but apply the UDF to the SELECTed column. In this way, the UDF is only applied to the filtered result-set and not every row of the table as part of the filter. Of course, the absolute <em>best</em> approach for this is to use SQL Server 2008 (or higher) and separate out your dates and times, as the SQL Server database engine is then natively providing the individual date and time components, and can efficiently query these independently without the need for a UDF or other mechanism to extract either the date or time part from a composite datetime type.","To remove the time part of a datetime in SQL Server, consider using User Defined Functions (UDFs) for SQL Server 2005 or lower, but be aware of potential performance drawbacks when using UDFs in WHERE clauses.

1251636,What do Clustered and Non clustered index actually mean?,"A clustered index means you are telling the database to store close values actually close to one another on the disk. This has the benefit of rapid scan / retrieval of records falling into some range of clustered index values. For example, you have two tables, Customer and Order: If you wish to quickly retrieve all orders of one particular customer, you may wish to create a clustered index on the ""CustomerID"" column of the Order table. This way the records with the same CustomerID will be physically stored close to each other on disk (clustered) which speeds up their retrieval. P.S. The index on CustomerID will obviously be not unique, so you either need to add a second field to ""uniquify"" the index or let the database handle that for you but that's another story. Regarding multiple indexes. You can have only one clustered index per table because this defines how the data is physically arranged. If you wish an analogy, imagine a big room with many tables in it. You can either put these tables to form several rows or pull them all together to form a big conference table, but not both ways at the same time. A table can have other indexes, they will then point to the entries in the clustered index which in its turn will finally say where to find the actual data.","A clustered index stores close values physically close together on disk, allowing for rapid retrieval of records within a range of index values.

Therefore, there can be only one clustered index. With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows. You can have many non clustered indexes, although each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records.

Indeed, SQL Server will by default create a clustered index on your primary key column(s). As you will have learnt, the clustered index relates to the way data is physically sorted on disk, which means it's a good all-round choice for most situations.","Clustered indexes are typically used for primary keys or unique columns, where data is physically sorted on disk, whereas non-clustered indexes are used for other situations, such as foreign keys.",,"A very simple, non-technical rule-of-thumb would be that clustered indexes are usually used for your primary key (or, at least, a unique column) and that non-clustered are used for other situations (maybe a foreign key)."
28002,Regular cast vs. static_cast vs. dynamic_cast,"You should look at the article <em>C++ Programming/Type Casting</em>. It contains a good description of all of the different cast types. The following taken from the above link: const_cast const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types. 'e.g.' char->long, int->short etc. Static cast is also used to cast pointers to related types, for  example casting void* to the appropriate type. dynamic_cast Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy). dynamic_cast(expression) The target type must be a pointer or reference type, and the  expression must evaluate to a pointer or reference. Dynamic cast works  only when the type of object to which the expression refers is  compatible with the target type and the base class has at least one  virtual member function. If not, and the type of expression being cast  is a pointer, NULL is returned, if a dynamic cast on a reference  fails, a bad_cast exception is thrown. When it doesn't fail, dynamic  cast returns a pointer or reference of the target type to the object  to which expression referred. reinterpret_cast Reinterpret cast simply casts one type bitwise to another. Any pointer  or integral type can be casted to any other with reinterpret cast,  easily allowing for misuse. For instance, with reinterpret cast one  might, unsafely, cast an integer pointer to a string pointer.","Here is a brief and accurate summary:

In C++, there are four types of casts: `const_cast` (adds/removes const-ness), `static_cast` (casts between integer types or related pointer types), `dynamic_cast` (converts pointers/references at runtime, typically for inheritance hierarchies), and `reinterpret_cast` (casts one type bitwise to another, potentially allowing for misuse). Each cast has specific use cases and limitations, and `dynamic_cast` requires a virtual member function in the base class to work correctly.","dynamic_cast Dynamic cast is used to convert pointers and references at run-time,  generally for the purpose of casting a pointer or reference up or down  an inheritance chain (inheritance hierarchy). reinterpret_cast Reinterpret cast simply casts one type bitwise to another.","const_cast(expression) The const_cast&lt;>() is used to add/remove  const(ness) (or volatile-ness) of a variable. static_cast(expression) The static_cast&lt;>() is used to cast between  the integer types.

Version that will also work on LANs without an internet connection: (thanks @ccpizza) Background: Using <code>socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())</code> did not work here, because one of the computers I was on had an <code>/etc/hosts</code> with duplicate entries and references to itself. <code>socket.gethostbyname()</code> only returns the last entry in <code>/etc/hosts</code>. This was my initial attempt, which weeds out all addresses starting with <code>""127. ""</code>: This works with Python 2 and 3, on Linux and Windows, but does not deal with several network devices or IPv6. However, it stopped working on recent Linux distros, so I tried this alternative technique instead. It tries to connect to the Google DNS server at <code>8.8.8.8</code> at port <code>53</code>: Then I combined the two above techniques into a one-liner that should work everywhere, and created the <code>myip</code> alias and Python snippet at the top of this answer. With the increasing popularity of IPv6, and for servers with multiple network interfaces, using a third-party Python module for finding the IP address is probably both more robust and reliable than any of the methods listed here.","To find the local IP address using Python's standard library, you can use the following methods: 

1. `socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())` - however, this may not work if there are duplicate entries in `/etc/hosts`.

3. A version that works on LANs without internet connection.

To quote the blog entry: The value of the setting is not ""appname.models.modelname"", it's just ""appname.modelname"". The reason is that Django is not using this to do a direct import; instead, it's using an internal model-loading function which only wants the name of the app and the name of the model. Trying to do things like ""appname.models.modelname"" or ""projectname.appname.models.modelname"" in the AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE setting will cause Django to blow up with the dreaded ""too many values to unpack"" error, so make sure you've put ""appname.modelname"", and nothing else, in the value of AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE. If the OP had copied more of the traceback I would expect to see something like the one below which I was able to duplicate by adding ""models"" to my AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE setting. This I think is one of the few cases where Django still has a bit of import magic that tends to cause confusion when a small error doesn't throw the expected exception.

109023,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"This is one of those questions where it helps to know your micro-architecture. I just timed two variants under gcc 4.3.3 compiled with -O3 using C++ inlines to eliminate function call overhead, one billion iterations, keeping the running sum of all counts to ensure the compiler doesn't remove anything important, using rdtsc for timing (clock cycle precise). The unmodified Hacker's Delight took 12.2 gigacycles. My parallel version (counting twice as many bits) runs in 13.0 gigacycles. 10.5s total elapsed for both together on a 2.4GHz Core Duo. 25 gigacycles = just over 10 seconds at this clock frequency, so I'm confident my timings are right. This has to do with instruction dependency chains, which are very bad for this algorithm. I could nearly double the speed again by using a pair of 64-bit registers. In fact, if I was clever and added x+y a little sooner I could shave off some shifts. The 64-bit version with some small tweaks would come out about even, but count twice as many bits again. With 128 bit SIMD registers, yet another factor of two, and the SSE instruction sets often have clever short-cuts, too. There's no reason for the code to be especially transparent. The interface is simple, the algorithm can be referenced on-line in many places, and it's amenable to comprehensive unit test. The programmer who stumbles upon it might even learn something. These bit operations are extremely natural at the machine level. OK, I decided to bench the tweaked 64-bit version. For this one  sizeof(unsigned long) == 8 That looks about right (I'm not testing carefully, though). Now the timings come out at 10.70 gigacycles / 14.1 gigacycles. That later number summed 128 billion bits and corresponds to 5.9s elapsed on this machine. The non-parallel version speeds up a tiny bit because I'm running in 64-bit mode and it likes 64-bit registers slightly better than 32-bit registers. Let's see if there's a bit more OOO pipelining to be had here. This was a bit more involved, so I actually tested a bit. Each term alone sums to 64, all combined sum to 256. I was excited for a moment, but it turns out gcc is playing inline tricks with -O3 even though I'm not using the inline keyword in some tests. When I let gcc play tricks, a billion calls to pop4() takes 12.56 gigacycles, but I determined it was folding arguments as constant expressions. A more realistic number appears to be 19.6gc for another 30% speed-up. My test loop now looks like this, making sure each argument is different enough to stop gcc from playing tricks. 256 billion bits summed in 8.17s elapsed. Works out to 1.02s for 32 million bits as benchmarked in the 16-bit table lookup. Can't compare directly, because the other bench doesn't give a clock speed, but looks like I've slapped the snot out of the 64KB table edition, which is a tragic use of L1 cache in the first place. Update: decided to do the obvious and create pop6() by adding four more duplicated lines. Came out to 22.8gc, 384 billion bits summed in 9.5s elapsed. So there's another 20%   Now at 800ms for 32 billion bits.","To count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer, the most efficient approach involves optimizing the algorithm to minimize instruction dependency chains and leveraging larger registers. The author tested various versions, including a 64-bit version with tweaks, and achieved significant speed improvements.

Further optimization with `pop6()` achieved another 20% improvement, resulting in a time of 800ms for 32 billion bits.",256 billion bits summed in 8.17s elapsed.

Normally, in Python, you want your code to support inheritance, of course (since inheritance is so handy, it would be bad to stop code using yours from using it! ), so <code>isinstance</code> is less bad than checking identity of <code>type</code>s because it seamlessly supports inheritance. It's not that <code>isinstance</code> is <em>good</em>, mind youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂt's just <em>less bad</em> than checking equality of types. The normal, Pythonic, preferred solution is almost invariably ""duck typing"": try using the argument <em>as if</em> it was of a certain desired type, do it in a <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> statement catching all exceptions that could arise if the argument was not in fact of that type (or any other type nicely duck-mimicking it;-), and in the <code>except</code> clause, try something else (using the argument ""as if"" it was of some other type). <code>basestring</code> <strong>is</strong>, however, quite a special caseÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂ builtin type that exists <strong>only</strong> to let you use <code>isinstance</code> (both <code>str</code> and <code>unicode</code> subclass <code>basestring</code>).

The concept is obviously a growing one in Python, since PEP 3119, which introduces a generalization of it, was accepted and has been implemented starting with Python 2.6 and 3.0. The PEP makes it clear that, while ABCs can often substitute for duck typing, there is generally no big pressure to do that (see here). ABCs as implemented in recent Python versions do however offer extra goodies: <code>isinstance</code> (and <code>issubclass</code>) can now mean more than just ""[an instance of] a derived class"" (in particular, any class can be ""registered"" with an ABC so that it will show as a subclass, and its instances as instances of the ABC); and ABCs can also offer extra convenience to actual subclasses in a very natural way via Template Method design pattern applications (see here and here [[part II]] for more on the TM DP, in general and specifically in Python, independent of ABCs). For the underlying mechanics of ABC support as offered in Python 2.6, see here; for their 3.1 version, very similar, see here. In both versions, standard library module collections (that's the 3.1 versionÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂÂor the very similar 2.6 version, see here) offers several useful ABCs.

1595848,Configuring Git over SSH to login once,"Try <code>ssh-add</code>, you need <code>ssh-agent</code> to be running and holding your private key (Ok, responding to the updated question, you first run <code>ssh-keygen</code> to generate a public and private key as Jefromi explained. You put the public key on the server. You should use a passphrase, if you don't you have the equivalent of a plain-text password in your private key. But when you do, then you need as a practical matter <code>ssh-agent</code> as explained below.) You want to be running <code>ssh-agent</code> in the background as you log in. Once you log in, the idea is to run <code>ssh-add</code> once and only once, in order to give the agent your passphrase, to decode your key. The agent then just sits in memory with your key unlocked and loaded, ready to use every time you ssh somewhere. All ssh-family commands1 will then consult the agent and automatically be able to use your private key. On OSX (err, <em>macOS</em>), GNOME and KDE systems, <code>ssh-agent</code> is usually launched automatically for you. I will go through the details in case, like me, you also have a Cygwin or other windows environment where this most certainly is not done for you. Start here: <code>man ssh-agent</code>. There are various ways to automatically run the agent. As the man page explains, you can run it so that it is a parent of all your login session's other processes. That way, the environment variables it provides will automatically be in all your shells. When you (later) invoke <code>ssh-add</code> or <code>ssh</code> both will have access to the agent because they all have the environment variables with magic socket pathnames or whatever. Alternatively, you can run the agent as an ordinary child, save the environment settings in a file, and source that file in every shell when it starts. My OSX and Ubuntu systems automatically do the agent launch setup, so all I have to do is run <code>ssh-add</code> once. Try running <code>ssh-add</code> and see if it works, if so, then you just need to do that once per reboot. My Cygwin system needed it done manually, so I did this in my <code>.profile</code> and I have <code>.bashrc</code> source <code>.profile</code>: BIGBLOCK The <code>.agent</code> file is created automatically by the script; it contains the environment variables definitions and exports.

1595848,Configuring Git over SSH to login once,"I think there are two different things here. The first one is that normal SSH authentication requires the user to put the account's password (where the account password will be authenticated against different methods, depending on the sshd configuration). You can avoid putting that password using certificates. With certificates you still have to put a password, but this time is the password of your private key (that's independent of the account's password). To do this you can follow the instructions pointed out by steveth45: With Public Key Authentication. If you want to avoid putting the certificate's password every time then you can use ssh-agent, as pointed out by DigitalRoss The exact way you do this depends on Unix vs Windows, but essentially you need to run ssh-agent in the background when you log in, and then the first time you log in, run ssh-add to give the agent your passphrase. All ssh-family commands will then consult the agent and automatically pick up your passphrase. Start here: man ssh-agent. The only problem of ssh-agent is that, on *nix at least, you have to put the certificates password on every new shell. And then the certificate is ""loaded"" and you can use it to authenticate against an ssh server without putting any kind of password. But this is on that particular shell. With keychain you can do the same thing as ssh-agent but ""system-wide"". Once you turn on your computer, you open a shell and put the password of the certificate. And then, every other shell will use that ""loaded"" certificate and your password will never be asked again until you restart your PC. Gnome has a similar application, called Gnome Keyring that asks for your certificate's password the first time you use it and then it stores it securely so you won't be asked again.","To configure Git over SSH to login once, you can use Public Key Authentication with certificates, which requires a private key password instead of an account password.

136097,What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?,"Maybe a bit of example code will help: Notice the difference in the call signatures of <code>foo</code>, <code>class_foo</code> and <code>static_foo</code>: Below is the usual way an object instance calls a method. The object instance, <code>a</code>, is implicitly passed as the first argument. <strong>With classmethods</strong>, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument instead of <code>self</code>. You can also call <code>class_foo</code> using the class. In fact, if you define something to bea classmethod, it is probably because you intend to call it from the class rather than from a class instance. <code>A.foo(1)</code> would have raised a TypeError, but <code>A.class_foo(1)</code> works just fine: One use people have found for class methods is to create inheritable alternative constructors. <strong>With staticmethods</strong>, neither <code>self</code> (the object instance) nor  <code>cls</code> (the class) is implicitly passed as the first argument. They behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an instance or the class: Staticmethods are used to group functions which have some logical connection with a class to the class. <code>foo</code> is just a function, but when you call <code>a.foo</code> you don't just get the function,you get a ""partially applied"" version of the function with the object instance <code>a</code> bound as the first argument to the function. <code>foo</code> expects 2 arguments, while <code>a.foo</code> only expects 1 argument. <code>a</code> is bound to <code>foo</code>. That is what is meant by the term ""bound"" below: With <code>a.class_foo</code>, <code>a</code> is not bound to <code>class_foo</code>, rather the class <code>A</code> is bound to <code>class_foo</code>. Here, with a staticmethod, even though it is a method, <code>a.static_foo</code> just returnsa good 'ole function with no arguments bound. <code>static_foo</code> expects 1 argument, and<code>a.static_foo</code> expects 1 argument too. And of course the same thing happens when you call <code>static_foo</code> with the class <code>A</code> instead.","The main difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python is how they handle the first argument. 

- `@classmethod` implicitly passes the class of the object instance as the first argument, allowing it to be called from the class or instance.
- `@staticmethod` does not implicitly pass any arguments, behaving like a plain function that can be called from an instance or the class, often used to group logically related functions with a class.

1673967,How to run an EXE file in PowerShell with parameters with spaces and quotes,"When PowerShell sees a command starting with a string it just evaluates the string, that is, it typically echos it to the screen, for example: If you want PowerShell to interpret the string as a command name then use the call operator (&amp;) like so: After that you probably only need to quote parameter/argument pairs that contain spaces and/or quotation chars. When you invoke an EXE file like this with complex command line arguments it is usually very helpful to have a tool that will show you how PowerShell sends the arguments to the EXE file. The PowerShell Community Extensions has such a tool. It is called echoargs. You just replace the EXE file with echoargs - leaving all the arguments in place, and it will show you how the EXE file will receive the arguments, for example: Using echoargs you can experiment until you get it right, for example: It turns out I was trying too hard before to maintain the double quotes around the connection string. Apparently that isn't necessary because even cmd.exe will strip those out. BTW, hats off to the PowerShell team. They were quite helpful in showing me the specific incantation of single &amp; double quotes to get the desired result - if you needed to keep the internal double quotes in place. :-)  They also realize this is an area of pain, but they are driven by the number of folks are affected by a particular issue.

The idea was that the U.S. federal procurements needed a way to legally specify the requirements for various sorts of bids and contracts in a way that could be used to exclude systems to which a given existing code base or programming staff would NOT be portable. Since POSIX was written post facto ... to describe a loosely similar set of competing systems ... it was NOT written in a way that could be implemented.

1835018,How to check if an object is a list or tuple (but not string)?,"Remember that in Python we want to use ""duck typing"". So, anything that acts like a list can be treated as a list. So, don't check for the type of a list, just see if it acts like a list. But strings act like a list too, and often that is not what we want. There are times when it is even a problem! So, check explicitly for a string, but then use duck typing. Here is a function I wrote for fun. It is a special version of <code>repr()</code> that prints any sequence in angle brackets ('&lt;', '>'). This is clean and elegant, overall. But what's that <code>isinstance()</code> check doing there? That's kind of a hack. But it is essential. This function calls itself recursively on anything that acts like a list. If we didn't handle the string specially, then it would be treated like a list, and split up one character at a time. But then the recursive call would try to treat each character as a list -- and it would work! Even a one-character string works as a list! The function would keep on calling itself recursively until stack overflow. Functions like this one, that depend on each recursive call breaking down the work to be done, have to special-case strings--because you can't break down a string below the level of a one-character string, and even a one-character string acts like a list. Note: the <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> is the cleanest way to express our intentions. But if this code were somehow time-critical, we might want to replace it with some sort of test to see if <code>arg</code> is a sequence. Rather than testing the type, we should probably test behaviors. If it has a <code>.strip()</code> method, it's a string, so don't consider it a sequence; otherwise, if it is indexable or iterable, it's a sequence: EDIT: I originally wrote the above with a check for <code>__getslice__()</code> but I noticed that in the <code>collections</code> module documentation, the interesting method is <code>__getitem__()</code>; this makes sense, that's how you index an object. That seems more fundamental than <code>__getslice__()</code> so I changed the above.","To check if an object is a list or tuple (but not a string) in Python, use duck typing and check if the object is indexable or iterable, but not a string. You can do this by checking if the object has a `__getitem__()` method (for indexing) and is not a string, or by using a try-except block to attempt to iterate over the object. This approach avoids explicitly checking the type of the object and instead focuses on its behavior.","Remember that in Python we want to use ""duck typing"".

1835018,How to check if an object is a list or tuple (but not string)?,"Generally speaking, the fact that a function which iterates over an object works on strings as well as tuples and lists is more feature than bug. You certainly can use <code>isinstance</code> or duck typing to check an argument, but why should you? That sounds like a rhetorical question, but it isn't. The answer to ""why should I check the argument's type?"" is probably going to suggest a solution to the real problem, not the perceived problem. Why is it a bug when a string is passed to the function? Also:  if it's a bug when a string is passed to this function, is it also a bug if some other non-list/tuple iterable is passed to it? Why, or why not? I think that the most common answer to the question is likely to be that developers who write <code>f(""abc"")</code> are expecting the function to behave as though they'd written <code>f([""abc""])</code>. There are probably circumstances where it makes more sense to protect developers from themselves than it does to support the use case of iterating across the characters in a string. But I'd think long and hard about it first.","To check if an object is a list or tuple but not a string, consider using `isinstance()`. However, it's essential to question why type checking is necessary, as it may indicate a deeper issue. Instead of type checking, focus on handling the expected behavior for different input types, such as treating a string as a single-element list. Ultimately, the decision to restrict input types depends on the specific use case and whether it's more important to support iteration over characters in a string or protect against potential misuse.","Why, or why not?",

3881,IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException for a null parameter?,"Voted up Jason Cohen's argument because it was well presented. Let me dismember it step by step. ;-) The NPE JavaDoc explicitly says, ""other illegal uses of the null object"". If it was just limited to situations where the runtime encounters a null when it shouldn't, all such cases could be defined far more succinctly. Can't help it if you assume the wrong thing, but assuming encapsulation is applied properly, you really shouldn't care or notice whether a null was dereferenced inappropriately vs. whether a method detected an inappropriate null and fired an exception off. I'd choose NPE over IAE for multiple reasons It is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation Logic that mistakenly allows nulls tends to be very different from logic that mistakenly allows illegal values. For example, if I'm validating data entered by a user, if I get value that is unacceptable, the source of that error is with the end user of the application. If I get a null, that's programmer error. Invalid values can cause things like stack overflows, out of memory errors, parsing exceptions, etc. Indeed, most errors generally present, at some point, as an invalid value in some method call. For this reason I see IAE as actually the MOST GENERAL of all exceptions under RuntimeException. Actually, other invalid arguments can result in all kinds of other exceptions. UnknownHostException, FileNotFoundException, a variety of syntax error exceptions, IndexOutOfBoundsException, authentication failures, etc., etc. In general, I feel NPE is much maligned because traditionally has been associated with code that fails to follow the fail fast principle. That, plus the JDK's failure to populate NPE's with a message string really has created a strong negative sentiment that isn't well founded. Indeed, the difference between NPE and IAE from a runtime perspective is strictly the name. From that perspective, the more precise you are with the name, the more clarity you give to the caller.","The answer suggests using `NullPointerException` (NPE) over `IllegalArgumentException` (IAE) when a null parameter is passed, as NPE is more specific about the nature of the error and implies a programming error, whereas IAE is more general and can encompass a wide range of invalid values and errors. This approach provides more clarity to the caller and helps distinguish between programming errors and invalid user input.","I'd choose NPE over IAE for multiple reasons It is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation If I get a null, that's programmer error.","In general, I feel NPE is much maligned because traditionally has been associated with code that fails to follow the fail fast principle."

Depending on your answer, one of the following sets ofsettings should work for you: <li><strong>For tab characters that appear 4-spaces-wide</strong>: If you're using actual tab character in your source code you probably also want these settings (these are actually the defaults, but you may want to set them defensively): Finally, if you want an indent to correspond to a single tab, you should also use: <li><strong>For indents that consist of 4 space characters</strong> but are entered with the tab key: <strong>To make the above settings permanent addthese lines to your vimrc.</strong> In case you need to make adjustments, or would simply like to understand what these options all mean, here's a breakdown of what each option means: The width of a hard tabstop measured in ""spaces"" -- effectively the (maximum) width of an actual tab character.

This is also used by things like the <code>=</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> commands. Setting this to a non-zero value other than <code>tabstop</code> will make the tab key (in insert mode)   insert a combination of spaces (and possibly tabs) to <em>simulate</em> tab stops at this width. Enabling this will make the tab key (in insert mode) insert spaces instead of   tab characters. This also affects the behavior of the <code>retab</code> command. Enabling this will make the tab key (in insert mode) insert spaces or tabs to  go to the next indent  of the next tabstop when the cursor is at the beginning of a line (i.e. the  only preceding characters are whitespace).

2067472,What is JSONP all about?,"Because you can ask the server to append a prefix to the returned JSON object. E.g <code>function_prefix(json_object);</code> in order for the browser to <code>eval</code> ""inline"" the JSON string as an expression. This trick makes it possible for the server to ""inject"" javascript code directly in the Client browser and this with bypassing the ""same origin"" restrictions. In other words, you can have cross-domain data exchange. Normally, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> doesn't permit cross-domain data-exchange directly (one needs to go through a server in the same domain) whereas: <code>&lt;script src=""some_other_domain/some_data.js&amp;prefix=function_prefix</code>>` one can access data from a domain different than from the origin. Also worth noting: even though the server should be considered as ""trusted"" before attempting that sort of ""trick"", the side-effects of possible change in object format etc. can be contained. If a <code>function_prefix</code> (i.e. a proper js function) is used to receive the JSON object, the said function can perform checks before accepting/further processing the returned data.","JSONP (JSON with Padding) allows for cross-domain data exchange by appending a prefix to a JSON object, enabling a browser to evaluate it as JavaScript and bypass same-origin restrictions, but requires trusting the server and using a proper function to receive and validate the data.","Because you can ask the server to append a prefix to the returned JSON object.

2067472,What is JSONP all about?,"It's actually not too complicated... Say you're on domain example.com, and you want to make a request to domain example.net. To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland. The one item that bypasses this limitation is &lt;script&gt; tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really do anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated. Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle. For example, say the server expects a parameter called ""callback"" to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like: Without JSONP, this might return some basic JavaScript object, like so: However, with JSONP, when the server receives the ""callback"" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this: As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function: And now, when the script is loaded, it'll be evaluated, and your function will be executed. Voila, cross-domain requests! It's also worth noting the one major issue with JSONP: you lose a lot of control of the request. For example, there is no ""nice"" way to get proper failure codes back. As a result, you end up using timers to monitor the request, etc, which is always a bit suspect. The proposition for JSONRequest is a great solution to allowing cross domain scripting, maintaining security, and allowing proper control of the request. These days (2015), CORS is the recommended approach vs. JSONRequest. JSONP is still useful for older browser support, but given the security implications, unless you have no choice CORS is the better choice.","JSONP (JSON with Padding) allows cross-domain requests by bypassing browser limitations using `<script>` tags. It works by passing a callback parameter to a JSONP-enabled server, which wraps its response in a function call that can be handled by the requesting page. This enables cross-domain communication, but has limitations, such as loss of control over the request and no proper error handling. Nowadays, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is the recommended approach, with JSONP being useful only for older browser support due to security implications.","The one item that bypasses this limitation is &lt;script&gt; tags.

Let me explain. Many library routines are implemented so that they allow certain parameters to be callables (of whom lambda is one). The idea is that the actual value will be computed only at the time when it's going to be used (rather that when it's called). An (contrived) example might help to illustrate the point. Suppose you have a routine which which was going to do log a given timestamp. You want the routine to use the current time minus 30 minutes. You'd call it like so Now suppose the actual function is going to be called only when a certain event occurs and you want the timestamp to be computed only at that time. You can do this like so Assuming the <code>log_timestamp</code> can handle callables like this, it will evaluate this when it needs it and you'll get the timestamp at that time. There are of course alternate ways to do this (using the <code>operator</code> module for example) but I hope I've conveyed the point. Update: Here is a slightly more concrete real world example.

2095397,"What is the difference between JSF, Servlet and JSP?","JSP (JavaServer Pages) JSP is a Java view technology running on the server machine which allows you to write template text in client side languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ect.). JSP supports taglibs, which are backed by pieces of Java code that let you control the page flow or output dynamically. A well-known taglib is JSTL. JSP also supports Expression Language, which can be used to access backend data (via attributes available in the page, request, session and application scopes), mostly in combination with taglibs. When a JSP is requested for the first time or when the web app starts up, the servlet container will compile it into a class extending <code>HttpServlet</code> and use it during the web app's lifetime. You can find the generated source code in the server's work directory. In for example Tomcat, it's the <code>/work</code> directory. On a JSP request, the servlet container will execute the compiled JSP class and send the generated output (usually just HTML/CSS/JS) through the web server over a network to the client side, which in turn displays it in the web browser. Servlets Servlet is a Java application programming interface (API) running on the server machine, which intercepts requests made by the client and generates/sends a response. A well-known example is the <code>HttpServlet</code> which provides methods to hook on HTTP requests using the popular HTTP methods such as <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>. You can configure <code>HttpServlet</code>s to listen to a certain HTTP URL pattern, which is configurable in <code>web.xml</code>, or more recently with Java EE 6, with <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation. When a Servlet is first requested or during web app startup, the servlet container will create an instance of it and keep it in memory during the web app's lifetime. The same instance will be reused for every incoming request whose URL matches the servlet's URL pattern. You can access the request data by <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and handle the response by <code>HttpServletResponse</code>. Both objects are available as method arguments inside any of the overridden methods of <code>HttpServlet</code>, such as <code>doGet()</code> and <code>doPost()</code>. JSF (JavaServer Faces) JSF is a component based MVC framework which is built on top of the Servlet API and provides components via taglibs which can be used in JSP or any other Java based view technology such as Facelets. Facelets is much more suited to JSF than JSP. It namely provides great templating capabilities such as composite components, while JSP basically only offers the <code>&lt;jsp:include&gt;</code> for templating, so that you're forced to create custom components with raw Java code (which is a bit opaque and a lot of tedious work in JSF) when you want to replace a repeated group of components with a single component. Since JSF 2.0, JSP has been deprecated as view technology in favor of Facelets. As being a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, JSF provides the <code>FacesServlet</code> as the sole request-response Controller. It takes all the standard and tedious HTTP request/response work from your hands, such as gathering user input, validating/converting them, putting them in model objects, invoking actions and rendering the response. This way you end up with basically a JSP or Facelets (XHTML) page for View and a JavaBean class as Model. The JSF components are used to bind the view with the model (such as your ASP.NET web control does) and the <code>FacesServlet</code> uses the JSF component tree to do all the work.

2130416,What are the applications of binary trees?,"When most people talk about binary trees, they're more often than not thinking about binary <em>search</em> trees, so I'll cover that first. A non-balanced binary search tree is actually useful for little more than educating students about data structures. That's because, unless the data is coming in in a relatively random order, the tree can easily degenerate into its worst-case form, which is a linked list, since simple binary trees are <em>not</em> balanced. A good case in point: I once had to fix some software which loaded its data into a binary tree for manipulation and searching. It wrote the data out in sorted form: BIGBLOCK so that, when reading it back in, ended up with the following tree: BIGBLOCK which is the degenerate form. If you go looking for Frank in that tree, you'll have to search all six nodes before you find him. Binary trees become truly useful when you balance them. This involves rotating sub-trees through their root node so that the height difference between any two sub-trees is less than or equal to 1. Adding those names above one at a time into a balanced tree would give you the following sequence: BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK You can actually see whole sub-trees rotating to the left as the entries are added and this gives you a balanced binary tree in which the worst case lookup is O(log N) rather than O(N) as the degenerate form gives. At no point does the highest NULL (<code>=</code>) differ from the lowest by more than one level. And, in the final tree above, you can find Frank by only looking at three nodes (<code>Chloe</code>, <code>Edwina</code> and, finally, <code>Frank</code>). Of course, they become even more useful when you make them balanced <em>multi-way</em> trees rather than binary tress. That means that each node holds more than one item (technically, they hold N items and N+1 pointers, a binary tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree  with 1 item and 2 pointers). With a three-way tree, you end up with: BIGBLOCK This is typically used in maintaining keys for an index of items. I've written database software optimised for the hardware where a node is exactly the size of a disk block (say, 512 bytes) and you put as many keys as you can into a single node. The <em>pointers</em> in this case were actually record numbers into a fixed-length-record direct-access file separate from the index file (so record number <code>X</code> could be found by just seeking to <code>X * record_length</code>). For example, if the pointers are 4 bytes and the key size is 10, the number of keys in a 512-byte node is 36. That's 36 keys (360 bytes) and 37 pointers (148 bytes) for a total of 508 bytes with 4 bytes wasted per node. The use of multi-way keys introduces the complexity of a two-phase search (multi-way search to find the correct node combined with a small sequential search to find the correct key in the node) but the advantage in doing less disk I/O more than makes up for this. I see no reason to do this for an in-memory structure, you'd be better off sticking with a balanced binary tree and keeping your code simple. Also keep in mind that the advantages of O(log N) over O(N) don't really appear when your data sets are small. If you're using a multi-way tree to store the fifteen people in your address book, it's probably overkill. The advantages come when you're storing something like every order from your hundred thousand customers over the last ten years. The whole point of big-O notation is to indicate what happens as the N approaches infinity. Some people may disagree but it's even okay to use bubble sort if you're sure the data sets will stay below a certain size, as long as nothing else is readily available :-) As to other uses for binary trees, there are a great many, such as: <li>Binary heaps where higher keys are <em>above or equal to</em> lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right); <li>Hash trees, similar to hash tables; <li>Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages; <li>Huffman trees for compression of data; <li>Routing trees for network traffic.

28002,Regular cast vs. static_cast vs. dynamic_cast,"static_cast <code>static_cast</code> is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. <code>static_cast</code> performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Example: In this example, you know that you passed a <code>MyClass</code> object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this. dynamic_cast <code>dynamic_cast</code> is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a <code>bad_cast</code> exception is thrown in that case). You cannot use <code>dynamic_cast</code> if you downcast (cast to a derived class) and the argument type is not polymorphic. For example, the following code is not valid, because <code>Base</code> doesn't contain any virtual function: An ""up-cast"" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both <code>static_cast</code> and <code>dynamic_cast</code>, and also without any cast, as an ""up-cast"" is an implicit conversion. Regular Cast These casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering <code>dynamic_cast</code>. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of <code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code> and <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use <code>dynamic_cast</code>. In addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the ""equivalent"" <code>static_cast</code> sequence would give you a compile-time error for that. Some people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity. I use them for numeric casts only, and use the appropriate C++ casts when user defined types are involved, as they provide stricter checking.","The main differences between regular cast, static_cast, and dynamic_cast in C++ are:

* **static_cast**: used for reversing implicit conversions without runtime checks, suitable when the object type is known.
* **dynamic_cast**: used when the dynamic type of an object is unknown, performs runtime checks, and returns a null pointer or throws an exception if the cast fails.
* **Regular cast (C-style cast)**: tries a sequence of C++ casts, including const_cast, static_cast, and reinterpret_cast, but does not use dynamic_cast, making it less safe but more powerful, and is generally recommended to be used only for numeric","These casts are also called C-style cast.

The reason that binary trees are used more often than n-ary trees for searching is that n-ary trees are more complex, but usually provide no real speed advantage. In a (balanced) binary tree with <code>m</code> nodes, moving from one level to the next requires one comparison, and there are <code>log_2(m)</code> levels, for a total of <code>log_2(m)</code> comparisons. In contrast, an n-ary tree will require <code>log_2(n)</code> comparisons <em>(using a binary search)</em> to move to the next level. Since there are <code>log_n(m)</code> total levels, the search will require <code>log_2(n)*log_n(m)</code> = <code>log_2(m)</code> comparisons total. So, though n-ary trees are more complex, they provide no advantage in terms of total comparisons necessary. <em>(However, n-ary trees are still useful in niche-situations. The examples that come immediately to mind are quad-trees and other space-partitioning trees, where divisioning space using only two nodes per level would make the logic unnecessarily complex; and B-trees used in many databases, where the limiting factor is not how many comparisons are done at each level but how many nodes can be loaded from the hard-drive at once)</em>","Binary trees have various applications, including:

2223386,Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?,"Overriding depends on having an instance of a class. The point of polymorphism is that you can subclass a class and the objects implementing those subclasses will have different behaviors for the same methods defined in the superclass (and overridden in the subclasses). A static method is not associated with any instance of a class so the concept is not applicable. There were two considerations driving Java's design that impacted this. One was a concern with performance: there had been a lot of criticism of Smalltalk about it being too slow (garbage collection and polymorphic calls being part of that) and Java's creators were determined to avoid that. Another was the decision that the target audience for Java was C++ developers.

But you can not <em>override</em> a static method, because class are no first-class object.

2223386,Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?,"Personally I think this is a flaw in the design of Java. Yes, yes, I understand that non-static methods are attached to an instance while static methods are attached to a class, etc etc. Still, consider the following code: BIGBLOCK This code will not work as you might expect. Namely, SpecialEmployee's get a 2% bonus just like regular employees. But if you remove the ""static""s, then SpecialEmployee's get a 3% bonus. (Admittedly, this example is poor coding style in that in real life you would likely want the bonus multiplier to be in a database somewhere rather than hard-coded. But that's just because I didn't want to bog down the example with a lot of code irrelevant to the point.) It seems quite plausible to me that you might want to make getBonusMultiplier static. Perhaps you want to be able to display the bonus multiplier for all the categories of employees, without needing to have an instance of an employee in each category. What would be the point of searching for such example instances? What if we are creating a new category of employee and don't have any employees assigned to it yet? This is quite logically a static function. But it doesn't work. And yes, yes, I can think of any number of ways to rewrite the above code to make it work. My point is not that it creates an unsolvable problem, but that it creates a trap for the unwary programmer, because the language does not behave as I think a reasonable person would expect. Perhaps if I tried to write a compiler for an OOP language, I would quickly see why implementing it so that static functions can be overriden would be difficult or impossible. Or perhaps there is some good reason why Java behaves this way. Can anyone point out an advantage to this behavior, some category of problem that is made easier by this? I mean, don't just point me to the Java language spec and say ""see, this is documented how it behaves"". I know that. But is there a good reason why it SHOULD behave this way? (Besides the obvious ""making it work right was too hard""...) <strong>Update</strong> @VicKirk: If you mean that this is ""bad design"" because it doesn't fit how Java handles statics, my reply is, ""Well, duh, of course."" As I said in my original post, it doesn't work. But if you mean that it is bad design in the sense that there would be something fundamentally wrong with a language where this worked, i.e. where statics could be overridden just like virtual functions, that this would somehow introduce an ambiguity or it would be impossible to implement efficiently or some such, I reply, ""Why? What's wrong with the concept?"" I think the example I give is a very natural thing to want to do. I have a class that has a function that does not depend on any instance data, and which I might very reasonably want to call independent of an instance, as well as wanting to call from within an instance method. Why should this not work? I've run into this situation a fair number of times over the years. In practice I get around it by making the function virtual, and then creating a static method whose only purpose in life is to be a static method that passes the call on to the virtual method with a dummy instance. That seems like a very roundabout way to get there.","The questioner is puzzled as to why Java does not allow overriding of static methods. They provide an example where a static method `getBonusMultiplier` is not overridden in a subclass `SpecialEmployee`, leading to unexpected behavior. The questioner argues that it would be reasonable to expect static methods to be overridable, especially when they don't depend on instance data, and that the current behavior creates a trap for unwary programmers.

3058,What is Inversion of Control?,"Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so. Pros: Your code gets decoupled so you can easily exchange implementations of an interface with alternative implementations It is a strong motivator for coding against interfaces instead of implementations It's very easy to write unit tests for your code because it depends on nothing else than the objects it accepts in its constructor/setters and you can easily initialize them with the right objects in isolation. Cons: IoC not only inverts the control flow in your program, it also clouds it considerably. This means you can no longer just read your code and jump from one place to another because the connections that would normally be in your code are not in the code anymore. Instead it is in XML configuration files or annotations and in the code of your IoC container that interprets these metadata. There arises a new class of bugs where you get your XML config or your annotations wrong and you can spend a lot of time finding out why your IoC container injects a null reference into one of your objects under certain conditions. Personally I see the strong points of IoC and I really like them but I tend to avoid IoC whenever possible because it turns your software into a collection of classes that no longer constitute a ""real"" program but just something that needs to be put together by XML configuration or annotation metadata and would fall (and falls) apart without it.","Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that decouples code, making it easier to exchange implementations and write unit tests, but it also introduces complexity, making it harder to understand the code flow and potentially leading to new types of bugs related to configuration and metadata.",Cons:,"Before using Inversion of Control you should be well aware of the fact that it has its pros and cons and you should know why you use it if you do so.

2297403,What is the difference between HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME in PHP?,"The <code>HTTP_HOST</code> is obtained from the HTTP request header and this is what the client actually used as ""target host"" of the request. The <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is defined in server config. Which one to use depends on what you need it for. You should now however realize that the one is a client-controlled value which may thus not be reliable for use in business logic and the other is a server-controlled value which is more reliable. You however need to ensure that the webserver in question has the <code>SERVER_NAME</code> correctly configured. Taking Apache HTTPD as an example, here's an extract from its documentation: If no <code>ServerName</code> is specified, then the server attempts to deduce the hostname by performing a reverse lookup on the IP address. If no port is specified in the <code>ServerName</code>, then the server will use the port from the incoming request. For optimal reliability and predictability, you should specify an explicit hostname and port using the <code>ServerName</code> directive. Update: after checking the answer of Pekka on your question which contains a link to bobince's answer that PHP would always return <code>HTTP_HOST</code>'s value for <code>SERVER_NAME</code>, which goes against my own PHP 4.x + Apache HTTPD 1.2.x experiences from a couple of years ago, I blew some dust from my current XAMPP environment on Windows XP (Apache HTTPD 2.2.1 with PHP 5.2.8), started it, created a PHP page which prints the both values, created a Java test application using <code>URLConnection</code> to modify the <code>Host</code> header and tests taught me that this is indeed (incorrectly) the case. After first suspecting PHP and digging in some PHP bug reports regarding the subject, I learned that the root of the problem is in web server used, that it incorrectly returned HTTP <code>Host</code> header when <code>SERVER_NAME</code> was requested. So I dug into Apache HTTPD bug reports using various keywords regarding the subject and I finally found a related bug. This behaviour was introduced since around Apache HTTPD 1.3. You need to set <code>UseCanonicalName</code> directive to <code>on</code> in the <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> entry of the <code>ServerName</code> in <code>httpd.conf</code> (also check the warning at the bottom of the document! ). This worked for me. Summarized, <code>SERVER_NAME</code> is more reliable, but you're dependent on the server config!","In PHP, `HTTP_HOST` is obtained from the HTTP request header and may be unreliable, while `SERVER_NAME` is defined in server config and more reliable.

2305966,"Why do I get the ""Unhandled exception type IOException""?","Java has a feature called ""checked exceptions"". That means that there are certain kinds of exceptions, namely those that subclass Exception but not RuntimeException, such that if a method may throw them, it must list them in its throws declaration, say: void readData() throws IOException. IOException is one of those. Thus, when you are calling a method that lists IOException in its throws declaration, you must either list it in your own throws declaration or catch it. The rationale for the presence of checked exceptions is that for some kinds of exceptions, you must not ignore the fact that they may happen, because their happening is quite a regular situation, not a program error. So, the compiler helps you not to forget about the possibility of such an exception being raised and requires you to handle it in some way. However, not all checked exception classes in Java standard library fit under this rationale, but that's a totally different topic.","The ""Unhandled exception type IOException"" error occurs because IOException is a checked exception in Java, which requires either a throws declaration or a try-catch block to handle it, as the compiler enforces explicit handling of potential exceptions that may regularly occur.","Java has a feature called ""checked exceptions"".

2223386,Why doesn't Java allow overriding of static methods?,"In Java (and many OOP languages, but I cannot speak for all; and some do not have static at all) all methods have a fixed signature - the parameters and types. In a virtual method, the first parameter is implied: a reference to the object itself and when called from within the object, the compiler automatically adds <code>this</code>. There is no difference for static methods - they still have a fixed signature. However, by declaring the method static you have explicitly stated that the compiler must not include the implied object parameter at the beginning of that signature. Therefore, any other code that calls this must <em>must not attempt to put a reference to an object on the stack</em>. If it did do that, then the method execution would not work since the parameters would be in the wrong place - shifted by one - on the stack. Because of this difference between the two; virtual methods always have a reference to the context object (i.e. <code>this</code>) so then it is possible to reference anything within the heap that belong to that instance of the object. But with static methods, since there is no reference passed, that method cannot access any object variables and methods since the context is not known. If you wish that Java would change the definition so that a object context is passed in for every method, static or virtual, then you would in essence have only virtual methods. As someone asked in a comment to the op - what is your reason and purpose for wanting this feature? I do not know Ruby much, as this was mentioned by the OP, I did some research. I see that in Ruby classes are really a special kind of object and one can create (even dynamically) new methods. Classes are full class objects in Ruby, they are not in Java. This is just something you will have to accept when working with Java (or C#). These are not dynamic languages, though C# is adding some forms of dynamic. In reality, Ruby does not have ""static"" methods as far as I could find - in that case these are methods on the singleton class object. You can then override this singleton with a new class and the methods in the previous class object will call those defined in the new class (correct?). So if you called a method in the context of the original class it still would only execute the original statics, but calling a method in the derived class, would call methods either from the parent or sub-class. Interesting and I can see some value in that. It takes a different thought pattern. Since you are working in Java, you will need to adjust to that way of doing things. Why they did this? Well, probably to improve performance at the time based on the technology and understanding that was available. Computer languages are constantly evolving. Go back far enough and there is no such thing as OOP. In the future, there will be other new ideas. <strong>EDIT</strong>: One other comment. Now that I see the differences and as I Java/C# developer myself, I can understand why the answers you get from Java developers may be confusing if you are coming from a language like Ruby. Java <code>static</code> methods are not the same as Ruby <code>class</code> methods. Java developers will have a hard time understanding this, as will conversely those who work mostly with a language like Ruby/Smalltalk. I can see how this would also be greatly confusing by the fact that Java also uses ""class method"" as another way to talk about static methods but this same term is used differently by Ruby. Java does not have Ruby style class methods (sorry); Ruby does not have Java style static methods which are really just old procedural style functions, as found in C. By the way - thanks for the question! I learned something new for me today about class methods (Ruby style).","In Java, static methods cannot be overridden because they do not have an implied object parameter, which is a reference to the object itself, unlike virtual methods. This means static methods cannot access object variables and methods, and their parameters are not shifted by one on the stack. Java's design choice is different from languages like Ruby, where classes are objects and can have dynamic methods, and this difference can lead to confusion between developers familiar with different languages. The reason for this design choice is likely due to performance considerations and the evolution of programming languages.","I see that in Ruby classes are really a special kind of object and one can create (even dynamically) new methods.

2422468,How to upload files to server using JSP/Servlet?,"Introduction To browse and select a file for upload you need a HTML <code>&lt;input type=""file""&gt;</code> field in the form. As stated in the HTML specification you have to use the <code>POST</code> method and the <code>enctype</code> attribute of the form has to be set to <code>""multipart/form-data""</code>. After submitting such a form, the binary multipart form data is available in the request body in a different format than when the <code>enctype</code> isn't set. Before Servlet 3.0, the Servlet API didn't natively support <code>multipart/form-data</code>. It supports only the default form enctype of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. The <code>request.getParameter()</code> and consorts would all return <code>null</code> when using multipart form data. This is where the well known Apache Commons FileUpload came into the picture. Don't manually parse it! You can in theory parse the request body yourself based on <code>ServletRequest#getInputStream()</code>. However, this is a precise and tedious work which requires precise knowledge of RFC2388. You shouldn't try to do this on your own or copypaste some homegrown library-less code found elsewhere on the Internet. Many online sources have failed hard in this, such as roseindia.net. See also uploading of pdf file. You should rather use a real library which is used (and implicitly tested!) by millions of users for years. Such a library has proven its robustness. When you're already on Servlet 3.0 or newer, use native API If you're using at least Servlet 3.0 (Tomcat 7, Jetty 9, JBoss AS 6, GlassFish 3, etc), then you can just use standard API provided <code>HttpServletRequest#getPart()</code> to collect the individual multipart form data items (most Servlet 3.0 implementations actually use Apache Commons FileUpload under the covers for this!). Also, normal form fields are available by <code>getParameter()</code> the usual way. First annotate your servlet with <code>@MultipartConfig</code> in order to let it recognize and support <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests and thus get <code>getPart()</code> to work: Then, implement its <code>doPost()</code> as follows: Note the <code>Path#getFileName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. In case you have a <code>&lt;input type=""file"" name=""file"" multiple=""true"" /&gt;</code> for multi-file upload, collect them as below (unfortunately there is no such method as <code>request.getParts(""file"")</code>): When you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, manually get submitted file name Note that <code>Part#getSubmittedFileName()</code> was introduced in Servlet 3.1 (Tomcat 8, Jetty 9, WildFly 8, GlassFish 4, etc). If you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, then you need an additional utility method to obtain the submitted file name. Note the MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. When you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet, use Apache Commons FileUpload If you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet (isn't it about time to upgrade? ), the common practice is to make use of Apache Commons FileUpload to parse the multpart form data requests. It has an excellent User Guide and FAQ (carefully go through both). There's also the O'Reilly (""cos"") <code>MultipartRequest</code>, but it has some (minor) bugs and isn't actively maintained anymore for years. I wouldn't recommend using it. Apache Commons FileUpload is still actively maintained and currently very mature. In order to use Apache Commons FileUpload, you need to have at least the following files in your webapp's <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code>: <code>commons-fileupload.jar</code> <code>commons-io.jar</code> Your initial attempt failed most likely because you forgot the commons IO. Here's a kickoff example how the <code>doPost()</code> of your <code>UploadServlet</code> may look like when using Apache Commons FileUpload: It's very important that you don't call <code>getParameter()</code>, <code>getParameterMap()</code>, <code>getParameterValues()</code>, <code>getInputStream()</code>, <code>getReader()</code>, etc on the same request beforehand. Otherwise the servlet container will read and parse the request body and thus Apache Commons FileUpload will get an empty request body. See also a.o. ServletFileUpload#parseRequest(request) returns an empty list. Note the <code>FilenameUtils#getName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. Alternatively you can also wrap this all in a <code>Filter</code> which parses it all automagically and put the stuff back in the parametermap of the request so that you can continue using <code>request.getParameter()</code> the usual way and retrieve the uploaded file by <code>request.getAttribute()</code>. You can find an example in this blog article. Workaround for GlassFish3 bug of <code>getParameter()</code> still returning <code>null</code> Note that Glassfish versions older than 3.1.2 had a bug wherein the <code>getParameter()</code> still returns <code>null</code>. If you are targeting such a container and can't upgrade it, then you need to extract the value from <code>getPart()</code> with help of this utility method: Saving uploaded file (don't use <code>getRealPath()</code> nor <code>part.write()</code>!)

2471055,Why use a READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level?,"The advantage is that it can be faster in some situations.

When this option is set, it is possible to read uncommitted or dirty data; values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction. This option has the same effect as setting NOLOCK on all tables in all SELECT statements in a transaction.

2480650,Role of Bias in Neural Networks,"Two different kinds of parameters can  be adjusted during the training of an  ANN, the weights and the value in the  activation functions. This is  impractical and it would be easier if  only one of the parameters should be  adjusted. To cope with this problem a  bias neuron is invented. The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1. Since the bias neuron  emits 1 the weights, connected to the  bias neuron, are added directly to the  combined sum of the other weights  (equation 2.1), just like the t value  in the activation functions.1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. Consider the AND boolean function represented by the following neural network: ANN http://www.aihorizon.com/images/essays/perceptron.gif <li><em>w0</em> corresponds to <em>b</em>. <li><em>w1</em> corresponds to <em>x1</em>. <li><em>w2</em> corresponds to <em>x2</em>. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions. For example, if we assume boolean values  of 1 (true) and -1 (false), then one  way to use a two-input perceptron to  implement the AND function is to set  the weights w0 = -3, and w1 = w2 = .5. This perceptron can be made to  represent the OR function instead by  altering the threshold to w0 = -.3. In  fact, AND and OR can be viewed as  special cases of m-of-n functions:  that is, functions where at least m of  the n inputs to the perceptron must be  true. The OR function corresponds to  m = 1 and the AND function to m = n.  Any m-of-n function is easily  represented using a perceptron by  setting all input weights to the same  value (e.g., 0.5) and then setting the  threshold w0 accordingly. Perceptrons can represent all of the  primitive boolean functions AND, OR,  NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR). Machine Learning- Tom Mitchell) The threshold is the bias and <em>w0</em> is the weight associated with the bias/threshold neuron.","In neural networks, a bias neuron is introduced to simplify the training process by allowing only one parameter (weights) to be adjusted. The bias neuron emits a constant value of 1, and its connected weights are added to the combined sum of other weights, effectively controlling the behavior of the layer. This enables a single neural network to represent similar cases, such as different boolean functions (e.g., AND, OR, NAND, NOR) by adjusting the bias (threshold) value.

This means that youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe using a linear function and thus an input of all zeros will always be mapped to an output of all zeros.

Adding bias introduces an extra dimension, allowing the network to map inputs to any value, not just those passing through the origin.

2480650,Role of Bias in Neural Networks,"I think that biases are almost always helpful. In effect, <strong>a bias value allows you to shift the activation function to the left or right</strong>, which may be critical for successful learning. It might help to look at a simple example. Consider this 1-input, 1-output network that has no bias: The output of the network is computed by multiplying the input (x) by the weight (w0) and passing the result through some kind of activation function (e.g. a sigmoid function.) Here is the function that this network computes, for various values of w0: Changing the weight w0 essentially changes the ""steepness"" of the sigmoid. That's useful, but what if you wanted the network to output 0 when x is 2? Just changing the steepness of the sigmoid won't really work -- <strong>you want to be able to shift the entire curve to the right</strong>. That's exactly what the bias allows you to do. If we add a bias to that network, like so: ...then the output of the network becomes sig(w0*x + w1*1.0). Here is what the output of the network looks like for various values of w1: Having a weight of -5 for w1 shifts the curve to the right, which allows us to have a network that outputs 0 when x is 2.","Biases in neural networks are helpful as they allow the activation function to be shifted to the left or right, enabling the network to learn and output desired values.

It wasn't that a new keyword wasn't considered -- just that it wasn't considered necessary given its potential disruption. And up until the ISO-C++ standard, this was the only way to declare a type parameter. But one should use <strong>typename</strong> rather than <strong>class</strong>! See the link for more info, but think about the following code: BIGBLOCK","The choice between using 'class' or 'typename' for template parameters is rooted in history.

2559527,Non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context,"You must understand the difference between a class and an instance of that class. If you see a car on the street, you know immediately that it's a car even if you can't see which model or type. This is because you compare what you see with the class ""car"". The class contains which is similar to all cars. Think of it as a template or an idea. At the same time, the car you see is an instance of the class ""car"" since it has all the properties which you expect: There is someone driving it, it has an engine, wheels. So the class says ""all cars have a color"" and the instance says ""this specific car is red"". In the OO world, you define the class and inside the class, you define a field of type <code>Color</code>. When the class is instantiated (when you create a specific instance), memory is reserved for the color and you can give this specific instance a color. Since these attributes are specific, they are non-static. Static fields and methods are shared with all instances. They are for values which are specific to the class and not a specific instance. For methods, this usually are global helper methods (like <code>Integer.parseInt()</code>). For fields, it's usually constants (like car types, i.e. something where you have a limited set which doesn't change often). To solve your problem, you need to instantiate an instance (create an object) of your class so the runtime can reserve memory for the instance (otherwise, different instances would overwrite each other which you don't want). In your case, try this code as a starting block: The new <code>main()</code> method creates an instance of the class it contains (sounds strange but since <code>main()</code> is created with the class instead of with the instance, it can do this) and then calls an instance method (<code>run()</code>).","The error ""Non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context"" occurs because you're trying to access an instance variable from a static method.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"I'd like to address the 4 points in the accepted answer, hopefully someone can explain why I'm wrong. Why is hiding dependencies in your code bad? There are already dozens of hidden dependencies (C runtime calls, OS API calls, global function calls), and singleton dependencies are easy to find (search for instance()). ""Making something global to avoid passing it around is a code smell."" Why isn't passing something around to avoid making it a singleton a code smell? If you're passing an object through 10 functions in a call stack just to avoid a singleton, is that so great? Single Responsibility Principle: I think this is a bit vague and depends on your definition of responsibility. A relevant question would be, why does adding this specific ""responsibility"" to a class matter? Why does passing an object to a class make it more tightly coupled than using that object as a singleton from within the class? Why does it change how long the state lasts? Singletons can be created or destroyed manually, so the control is still there, and you can make the lifetime the same as a non-singleton object's lifetime would be. Regarding unit tests: not all classes need to be unit tested not all classes that need to be unit tested need to change the implementation of the singleton if they do need be unit tested and do need to change the implementation, it's easy to change a class from using a singleton to having the singleton passed to it via dependency injection.","The author challenges the common criticisms of singletons, arguing that: hiding dependencies is not inherently bad, passing objects through multiple functions can be cumbersome, the Single Responsibility Principle is vague, and singletons do not necessarily make code less testable or more tightly coupled. They suggest that singletons can be controlled and modified to accommodate unit testing and dependency injection, and that the criticisms of singletons may be overstated.",,

2726657,INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN performance in SQL Server,"A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results. It would also be expected to return more rows, further increasing the total execution time simply due to the larger size of the result set. (And even if a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> <em>were</em> faster in <em>specific</em> situations due to some difficult-to-imagine confluence of factors, it is not functionally equivalent to an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, so you cannot simply go replacing all instances of one with the other!) Most likely your performance problems lie elsewhere, such as not having a candidate key or foreign key indexed properly. 9 tables is quite a lot to be joining so the slowdown could literally be almost anywhere. If you post your schema, we might be able to provide more details. <strong>Edit:</strong> Reflecting further on this, I could think of one circumstance under which a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> might be faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, and that is when: <li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows); <li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query. Consider this example: BIGBLOCK If you run this and view the execution plan, you'll see that the <code>INNER JOIN</code> query does indeed cost more than the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, because it satisfies the two criteria above. It's because SQL Server wants to do a hash match for the <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but does nested loops for the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>; the former is <em>normally</em> much faster, but since the number of rows is so tiny <em>and</em> there's no index to use, the hashing operation turns out to be the most expensive part of the query. You can see the same effect by writing a program in your favourite programming language to perform a large number of lookups on a list with 5 elements, vs. a hash table with 5 elements. Because of the size, the hash table version is actually slower. But increase it to 50 elements, or 5000 elements, and the list version slows to a crawl, because it's O(N) vs. O(1) for the hashtable. But change this query to be on the <code>ID</code> column instead of <code>Name</code> and you'll see a very different story. In that case, it does nested loops for both queries, but the <code>INNER JOIN</code> version is able to replace one of the clustered index scans with a seek - meaning that this will literally be <em>an order of magnitude</em> faster with a large number of rows. So the conclusion is more or less what I mentioned several paragraphs above; this is almost certainly an indexing or index coverage problem, possibly combined with one or more very small tables. Those are the only circumstances under which SQL Server <em>might</em> sometimes choose a worse execution plan for an <code>INNER JOIN</code> than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.","A `LEFT JOIN` is generally slower than an `INNER JOIN` because it requires additional work to null-extend the results. However, in rare cases with small tables and insufficient indexing, a `LEFT JOIN` might be faster due to the query optimizer choosing a different execution plan. The main cause of performance issues is likely due to indexing or index coverage problems, especially with complex queries involving multiple tables.","In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results.","A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>.

2926869,Do you need to dispose of objects and set them to null?,"Objects never go out of scope in C# as they do in C++. They are dealt with by the Garbage Collector automatically when they are not used anymore. This is a more complicated approach than C++ where the scope of a variable is entirely deterministic. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. An object can go ""out of scope"" in one function but if its value is returned, then GC would look at whether or not the calling function holds onto the return value. Setting object references to <code>null</code> is unnecessary as garbage collection works by working out which objects are being referenced by other objects. In practice, you don't have to worry about destruction, it just works and it's great :) <code>Dispose</code> must be called on all objects that implement <code>IDisposable</code> when you are finished working with them. Normally you would use a <code>using</code> block with those objects like so: BIGBLOCK <strong>EDIT</strong> On variable scope. Craig has asked whether the variable scope has any effect on the object lifetime. To properly explain that aspect of CLR, I'll need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#. Actual variable scope In both languages the variable can only be used in the same scope as it was defined - class, function or a statement block enclosed by braces. The subtle difference, however, is that in C#, variables cannot be redefined in a nested block. In C++, this is perfectly legal: BIGBLOCK In C#, however you get a a compiler error: BIGBLOCK This makes sense if you look at generated MSIL - all the variables used by the function are defined at the start of the function. Take a look at this function: BIGBLOCK Below is the generated IL. Note that iVal2, which is defined inside the if block is actually defined at function level. Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned. BIGBLOCK C++ scope and object lifetime Whenever a C++ variable, allocated on the stack, goes out of scope it gets destructed. Remember that in C++ you can create objects on the stack or on the heap. When you create them on the stack, once execution leaves the scope, they get popped off the stack and gets destroyed. BIGBLOCK When C++ objects are created on the heap, they must be explicitly destroyed, otherwise it is a memory leak. No such problem with stack variables though. C# Object Lifetime In CLR, objects (i.e. reference types) are <strong>always</strong> created on the managed heap. This is further reinforced by object creation syntax. Consider this code snippet. BIGBLOCK In C++ this would create an instance on <code>MyClass</code> on the stack and call its default constructor. In C# it would create a reference to class <code>MyClass</code> that doesn't point to anything. The only way to create an instance of a class is by using <code>new</code> operator: BIGBLOCK In a way, C# objects are a lot like objects that are created using <code>new</code> syntax in C++ - they are created on the heap but unlike C++ objects, they are managed by the runtime, so you don't have to worry about destructing them. Since the objects are <strong>always</strong> on the heap the fact that object references (i.e. pointers) go out of scope becomes moot. There are more factors involved in determining if an object is to be collected than simply presence of references to the object. C# Object references Jon Skeet compared object references in Java to pieces of string that are attached to the balloon, which is the object. Same analogy applies to C# object references. They simply point to a location of the heap that contains the object. Thus, setting it to null has no immediate effect on the object lifetime, the balloon continues to exist, until the GC ""pops"" it. Continuing down the balloon analogy, it would seem logical that once the balloon has no strings attached to it, it can be destroyed. In fact this is exactly how reference counted objects work in non-managed languages. Except this approach doesn't work for circular references very well. Imagine two balloons that are attached together by a string but neither balloon has a string to anything else. Under simple ref counting rules, they both continue to exist, even though the whole balloon group is ""orphaned"". .NET objects are a lot like helium balloons under a roof. When the roof opens (GC runs) - the unused balloons float away, even though there might be groups of balloons that are tethered together. .NET GC uses a combination of generational GC and mark and sweep. Generational approach involves the runtime favouring to inspect objects that have been allocated most recently, as they are more likely to be unused and mark and sweep involves runtime going through the whole object graph and working out if there are object groups that are unused. This adequately deals with circular dependency problem. Also, .NET GC runs on another thread(so called finalizer thread) as it has quite a bit to do and doing that on the main thread would interrupt your program.","In C#, objects are automatically managed by the Garbage Collector (GC) and do not require manual disposal or setting to null. The GC determines which objects are no longer in use and disposes of them. However, objects that implement `IDisposable` should have `Dispose` called on them when finished using, typically through a `using` block.

I've come across some very hard to find issues that were the direct result of not following the advice above. A good place to do this is in Dispose(), but sooner is usually better. In general, if a reference exists to an object the garbage collector (GC) may take a couple of generations longer to figure out that an object is no longer in use. All the while the object remains in memory. That may not be a problem until you find that your app is using a lot more memory than you'd expect. When that happens, hook up a memory profiler to see what objects are not being cleaned up.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"Here is one more thing about singletons which nobody said yet. In most cases ""singletonity"" is a detail of implementation for some class rather than characteristic of its interface. Inversion of Control Container may hide this characteristic from class users; you just need to mark your class as a singleton (with <code>@Singleton</code> annotation in Java for example) and that's it; IoCC will do the rest. You don't need to provide global access to your singleton instance because the access is already managed by IoCC. Thus there is nothing wrong with IoC Singletons. GoF Singletons in opposite to IoC Singletons are supposed to expose ""singletonity"" in the interface through getInstance() method, and so that they suffer from everything said above.","The issue with singletons lies not in the concept itself, but in how it's implemented. When using an Inversion of Control Container (IoCC), singletons can be managed without exposing their ""singletonity"" through a global access point, making them less problematic. However, traditional singletons, as described in the Gang of Four (GoF) pattern, which provide global access through a getInstance() method, suffer from various drawbacks.","GoF Singletons in opposite to IoC Singletons are supposed to expose ""singletonity"" in the interface through getInstance() method, and so that they suffer from everything said above.",

No assumptions can be made or else it will come back to bite you. Don't listen to leppie. A lot of objects don't actually implement IDisposable, so you don't have to worry about them. If they genuinely go out of scope they will be freed automatically. Also I have never come across the situation where I have had to set something to null. One thing that can happen is that a lot of objects can be held open. This can greatly increase the memory usage of your application. Sometimes it is hard to work out whether this is actually a memory leak, or whether your application is just doing a lot of stuff. Memory profile tools can help with things like that, but it can be tricky. In addition always unsubscribe from events that are not needed. Also be careful with WPF binding and controls. Not a usual situation, but I came across a situation where I had a WPF control that was being bound to an underlying object. The underlying object was large and took up a large amount of memory. The WPF control was being replaced with a new instance, and the old one was still hanging around for some reason. This caused a large memory leak. In hindsite the code was poorly written, but the point is that you want to make sure that things that are not used go out of scope. That one took a long time to find with a memory profiler as it is hard to know what stuff in memory is valid, and what shouldn't be there.","To ensure proper memory management, always call `Dispose` on objects that implement `IDisposable`. While many objects are automatically freed when out of scope, some may remain in memory if not properly disposed of, leading to potential memory leaks. Additionally, unsubscribing from unnecessary events and being cautious with WPF bindings can help prevent memory issues. Setting objects to `null` is generally not necessary, but using memory profiling tools can help identify and resolve memory-related problems.",Always call dispose.

MySQL have some good documentation on the subject (which is relevant for other SQL servers as well): http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-indexes.html An index can be used to efficiently find all rows matching some column in your query and then walk through only that subset of the table to find exact matches. If you don't have indexes on any column in the <code>WHERE</code> clause, the <code>SQL</code> server have to walk through the whole table and check every row to see if it matches, which may be a slow operation on big tables. The index can also be a <code>UNIQUE</code> index, which means that you cannot have duplicate values in that column, or a <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> which in some storage engines defines where in the database file the value is stored. In MySQL you can use <code>EXPLAIN</code> in front of your <code>SELECT</code> statement to see if your query will make use of any index.

Clustered index creates a physical order of rows (it can be only one and in most cases it is also a primary key - if you create primary key on table you create clustered index on this table also). Nonclustered index is also a binary tree but it doesn't create a physical order of rows. So the leaf nodes of nonclustered index contain PK (if it exists) or row index.

You could do <code>new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(split));</code> to create a real copy, but seeing what you are trying to do, here is an additional suggestion (you have a <code>O(n^2)</code> algorithm right below that). You want to remove <code>list.size() - count</code> (lets call this <code>k</code>) random elements from the list. Just pick as many random elements and swap them to the end <code>k</code> positions of the list, then delete that whole range (e.g. using subList() and clear() on that).

Update: As noted below, this algorithm only makes sense if the elements are unordered, e.g. if the List represents a Bag. If, on the other hand, the List has a meaningful order, this algorithm would not preserve it (polygenelubricants' algorithm instead would).

109023,How to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?,"I wrote a fast bitcount macro for RISC machines in about 1990. It does not use advanced arithmetic (multiplication, division, %), memory fetches (way too slow), branches (way too slow), but it does assume the CPU has a 32-bit barrel shifter (in other words, >> 1 and >> 32 take the same amount of cycles.) It assumes that small constants (such as 6, 12, 24) cost nothing to load into the registers, or are stored in temporaries and reused over and over again. With these assumptions, it counts 32 bits in about 16 cycles/instructions on most RISC machines. Note that 15 instructions/cycles is close to a lower bound on the number of cycles or instructions, because it seems to take at least 3 instructions (mask, shift, operator) to cut the number of addends in half, so log_2(32) = 5, 5 x 3 = 15 instructions is a quasi-lowerbound. Here is a secret to the first and most complex step: so if I take the 1st column (A) above, shift it right 1 bit, and subtract it from AB, I get the output (CD). The extension to 3 bits is similar; you can check it with an 8-row boolean table like mine above if you wish.

3044315,How to set the authorization header using curl,"http://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html See part 6. HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and    password so that it can verify that you're allowed to do the request you're    doing. The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by    default) is plain text based, which means it sends username and password    only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on    the network between you and the remote server. To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication: The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers    returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even    --anyauth might be options that suit you. Sometimes your HTTP access is only available through the use of a HTTP    proxy. This seems to be especially common at various companies. A HTTP proxy    may require its own user and password to allow the client to get through to    the Internet. To specify those with curl, run something like: If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,    use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest. If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password    part, curl will prompt for the password interactively. Do note that when a program is run, its parameters might be possible to see    when listing the running processes of the system. Thus, other users may be    able to watch your passwords if you pass them as plain command line    options. There are ways to circumvent this. It is worth noting that while this is how HTTP Authentication works, very    many web sites will not use this concept when they provide logins etc. See    the Web Login chapter further below for more details on that.","To set the authorization header using curl, you can use the `-u` or `--user` option followed by your username and password, or use other authentication methods such as `--ntlm`, `--digest`, or `--negotiate` if required by the server. You can also specify a proxy and its authentication details using options like `--proxy-ntlm` or `--proxy-digest`. If you omit the password, curl will prompt for it interactively.","HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication: If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method, If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password    part, curl will prompt for the password interactively.    options.",See part 6.

We then add a Bicycle, Car and Truck to the list. Next, we can loop through each Vehicle in the list, and treat them all identically, however when we access each Vehicles 'Wheels' property, the Vehicle class delegates the execution of that code to the relevant sub-class.

137975,What is so bad about singletons?,"Monopoly is the devil and singletons with non-readonly/mutable state are the 'real' problem... After reading Singletons are Pathological Liars as suggested in jason's answer I came across this little tidbit that provides the best presented example of how singletons are often misused. Global is bad because:   a. It causes namespace conflict   b. It exposes the state in a unwarranted fashion When it comes to Singletons   a. The explicit OO way of calling them, prevents the conflicts, so point a. is not an issue   b. Singletons without state are (like factories) are not a problem. Singletons with state can again fall in two categories, those which are immutable or write once and read many (config/property files). These are not bad. Mutable Singletons, which are kind of reference holders are the ones which you are speaking of. In the last statement he's referring to the blog's concept of 'singletons are liars'. How does this apply to Monopoly? To start a game of monopoly, first: we establish the rules first so everybody is on the same page everybody is given an equal start at the beginning of the game only one set of rules is presented to avoid confusion the rules aren't allowed to change throughout the game Now, for anybody who hasn't really played monopoly, these standards are ideal at best. A defeat in monopoly is hard to swallow because, monopoly is about money, if you lose you have to painstakingly watch the rest of the players finish the game, and losses are usually swift and crushing. So, the rules usually get twisted at some point to serve the self-interest of some of the players at the expense of the others. So you're playing monopoly with friends Bob, Joe, and Ed. You're swiftly building your empire and consuming market share at an exponential rate. Your opponents are weakening and you start to smell blood (figuratively). Your buddy Bob put all of his money into gridlocking as many low-value properties as possible but his isn't receiving a high return on investment the way he expected. Bob, as a stroke of bad luck, lands on your Boardwalk and is excised from the game. Now the game goes from friendly dice-rolling to serious business. Bob has been made the example of failure and Joe and Ed don't want to end up like 'that guy'. So, being the leading player you, all of a sudden, become the enemy. Joe and Ed start practicing under-the-table trades, behind-the-back money injections, undervalued house-swapping and generally anything to weaken you as a player until one of them rises to the top. Then, instead of one of them winning, the process starts all over. All of a sudden, a finite set of rules becomes a moving target and the game degenerates into the type of social interactions that would make up the foundation of every high-rated reality TV show since Survivor. Why, because the rules are changing and there's no consensus on how/why/what they're supposed to represent, and more importantly, there's no one person making the decisions. Every player in the game, at that point, is making his/her own rules and chaos ensues until two of the players are too tired to keep up the charade and slowly give up. So, if a rulebook for a game accurately represented a singleton, the monopoly rulebook would be an example of abuse. How does this apply to programming? Aside from all of the obvious thread-safety and synchronization issues that mutable singletons present... If you have one set of data, that is capable of being read/manipulated by multiple different sources concurrently and exists during the lifetime of the application execution, it's probably a good time to step back and ask ""am I using the right type of data structure here"". Personally, I have seen a programmer abuse a singleton by using it as some sort of twisted cross-thread database store within an application. Having worked on the code directly, I can attest that it was a slow (because of all the thread locks needed to make it thread-safe) and a nightmare to work on (because of the unpredictable/intermittent nature of synchronization bugs), and nearly impossible to test under 'production' conditions. Sure, a system could have been developed using polling/signaling to overcome some of the performance issues but that wouldn't solve the issues with testing and, why bother when a 'real' database can already accomplish the same functionality in a much more robust/scalable manner. A Singleton is only an option if you need what a singleton provides. A write-one read-only instance of an object. That same rule should cascade to the object's properties/members as well.","The issue with singletons is not the pattern itself, but rather the misuse of singletons with mutable state. Singletons without state or with immutable state are not problematic. However, mutable singletons can lead to issues such as namespace conflicts, exposed state, and thread-safety problems. The analogy of a game of Monopoly is used to illustrate how a set of rules (or a singleton) can be abused when multiple parties have different interpretations and interests, leading to chaos. In programming, mutable singletons can cause problems with concurrency, testing, and performance, and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, in which case a more robust solution like",When it comes to Singletons A Singleton is only an option if you need what a singleton provides.,Monopoly is the devil and singletons with non-readonly/mutable state are the 'real' problem...

3141087,"What is meant with ""const"" at end of function declaration?","A ""const function"", denoted with the keyword <code>const</code> after a function declaration, makes it a compiler error for this class function to change a member variable of the class. However, reading of a class variables is ok inside of the function, but writing inside of this function will generate a compiler error. Another way of thinking about such ""const function"" is by viewing an class function as a normal function taking an implicit <code>this</code> pointer. So a method <code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg)</code> (without the const at the end) results in a function like <code>int Foo_Bar(Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>, and a call such as <code>Foo f; f.Bar(4)</code> will internally correspond to something like <code>Foo f; Foo_Bar(&amp;f, 4)</code>. Now adding the const at the end (<code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg) const</code>) can then be understood as a declaration with a const this pointer: <code>int Foo_Bar(const Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>. Since the type of <code>this</code> in such case is const, no modifications of member variables are possible. It is possible to loosen the ""const function"" restriction of not allowing the function to write to any variable of a class. To allow some of the variables to be writable even when the function is marked as a ""const function"", these class variables are marked with the keyword <code>mutable</code>. Thus, if a class variable is marked as mutable, and a ""const function"" writes to this variable then the code will compile cleanly and the variable is possible to change. (C++11) As usual when dealing with the <code>const</code> keyword, changing the location of the const key word in a C++ statement has entirely different meanings. The above usage of <code>const</code> only apply when adding <code>const</code> to the end of the function declaration after the parenthesis. <code>const</code> is a highly overused qualifier in C++ and the syntax and ordering is often not straightforward in combination with pointers. Some readings about <code>const</code> correctness and the <code>const</code> keyword: Const correctness The C++ 'const' Declaration: Why &amp; How","In C++, a `const` keyword at the end of a function declaration makes the function unable to modify any member variables of the class, allowing only read access. This is equivalent to passing a `const` pointer to the class instance as an implicit `this` parameter.

3295496,What is a JavaBean exactly?,"A JavaBean is just a standard All properties private (use getters/setters) A public no-argument constructor Implements <code>Serializable</code>. That's it. It's just a convention. Lots of libraries depend on it though. With respect to <code>Serializable</code>, from the API documentation: Serializability of a class is enabled by the class implementing the   java.io.Serializable interface. Classes that do not implement this   interface will not have any of their state serialized or deserialized.   All subtypes of a serializable class are themselves serializable. The   serialization interface has no methods or fields and serves only to   identify the semantics of being serializable. In other words, serializable objects can be written to streams, and hence files, object databases, anything really. Also, there is no syntactic difference between a JavaBean and another class -- a class defines a JavaBean if it follows the standards. There is a term for it because the standard allows libraries to programmatically do things with class instances you define in a predefined way. For example, if a library wants to stream any object you pass into it, it knows it can because your object is serializable (assuming the lib requires your objects be proper JavaBeans).","A JavaBean is a Java class that follows a standard convention, characterized by: 
1. Private properties with public getters and setters,

3295496,What is a JavaBean exactly?,"There's a term for it to make it sound special. The reality is nowhere near so mysterious. Basically, a ""Bean"": is a serializable object (that is, it implements <code>java.io.Serializable</code>, and does so correctly), that has ""properties"" whose getters and setters are just methods with certain names (like, say, <code>getFoo()</code> is the getter for the ""Foo"" property), and has a public default constructor (so it can be created at will and configured by setting its properties). Update: As for <code>Serializable</code>:  That is nothing but a ""marker interface"" (an interface that doesn't declare any functions) that tells Java that the implementing class consents to (and implies that it is capable of) ""serialization"" -- a process that converts an instance into a stream of bytes. Those bytes can be stored in files, sent over a network connection, etc, and have enough info to allow a JVM (at least, one that knows about the object's type) to reconstruct the object later -- possibly in a different instance of the application, or even on a whole other machine! Of course, in order to do that, the class has to abide by certain limitations. Chief among them is that all instance fields must be either primitive types (int, bool, etc), instances of some class that is also serializable, or marked as <code>transient</code> so that Java won't try to include them. (This of course means that <code>transient</code> fields will not survive the trip over a stream. A class that has <code>transient</code> fields should be prepared to reinitialize them if necessary.) A class that can not abide by those limitations should not implement <code>Serializable</code> (and, IIRC, the Java compiler won't even let it do so.)","A JavaBean is a simple class that implements `java.io.Serializable`, has a public default constructor, and follows a naming convention for getter and setter methods, allowing it to be easily instantiated, configured, and serialized into a stream of bytes that can be stored or transmitted.","Basically, a ""Bean"": is a serializable object (that is, it implements <code>java.io.Serializable</code>, and does so correctly), that","There's a term for it to make it sound special.

These two constructor may throw <code>FileNotFoundException</code>, but like all <code>Scanner</code> methods, no <code>IOException</code> can be thrown beyond these constructors. You can query the <code>Scanner</code> itself through the <code>ioException()</code> method if an <code>IOException</code> occurred or not.

These would process the file in fixed-size chunks or a single character at a time. If you must process the file over white-space delimited strings, then use either <code>fgets</code> or <code>fread</code> to read the file, and something like <code>strtok</code> to split the buffer at whitespace. Don't forget to handle the transition from one buffer to the next, since your target strings are likely to span the buffer boundary. If there is an external requirement to use <code>scanf</code> to do the reading, then limit the length of the string it might read with a precision field in the format specifier. In your case with a 999 byte buffer, then say <code>scanf(""%998s"", str);</code> which will write at most 998 characters to the buffer leaving room for the nul terminator. If single strings longer than your buffer are allowed, then you would have to process them in two pieces.

3477333,What is the difference between POST and GET?,"<code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> are two different types of HTTP requests. According to Wikipedia: GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. and POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616) section 9 Method Definitions contains more information on <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> as well as the other HTTP methods, if you are interested. In addition to explaining the intended uses of each method, the spec also provides at least one practical reason for why <code>GET</code> should only be used to retrieve data: Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing servers, proxies, and user agents will log the request URI in some place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use POST-based form submission instead Finally, an important consideration when using <code>GET</code> for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a <code>GET</code> request. So if you, for example, poll using the same <code>GET</code> request you will always get back the same results, even if the data you are querying is being updated server-side. One way to alleviate this problem is to make the URL unique for each request by appending a timestamp.","The main difference between HTTP requests `GET` and `POST` is their purpose: `GET` is used to retrieve data, while `POST` is used to insert or update data. `GET` requests should not cause side effects and may be cached by browsers, whereas `POST` requests submit data to be processed and can result in the creation or update of resources.","<code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> are two different types of HTTP requests.

3492302,"Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s)","Wait a minute. As the question is stated, there are 100 numbers in the bag. No matter how big k is, the problem can be solved in constant time because you can use a set and remove numbers from the set in at most 100 - k iterations of a loop. 100 is constant. The set of remaining numbers is your answer. If we generalise the solution to the numbers from 1 to N, nothing changes except N is not a constant, so we are in O(N - k) = O(N) time. For instance, if we use a bit set, we set the bits to 1 in O(N) time, iterate through the numbers, setting the bits to 0 as we go (O(N-k) = O(N)) and then we have the answer. It seems to me that the interviewer was asking you how to <em>print out</em> the contents of the final set in O(k) time rather than O(N) time. Clearly, with a bit set, you have to iterate through all N bits to determine whether you should print the number or not.

667781,What is the difference between MVC and MVVM?,"MVC/MVVM is not an either/or choice. The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development. For ASP.Net, MVVM is used to two-way bind data within views. This is usually a client-side implementation (e.g. using Knockout.js). MVC on the other hand is a way of separating concerns on the server-side. For Silverlight and WPF, the MVVM pattern is more encompassing and can appear to act as a replacement for MVC (or other patterns of organising software into separate responsibilities). One assumption, that frequently came out of this pattern, was that the <code>ViewModel</code> simply replaced the controller in <code>MVC</code> (as if you could just  substitute <code>VM</code> for <code>C</code> in the acronym and all would be forgiven)... The ViewModel does not necessarily replace the need for separate Controllers. The problem is: that to be independently testable*, and especially reusable when needed, a view-model has no idea what view is displaying it, but more importantly no idea where its data is coming from. *Note: in practice Controllers remove most of the logic, from the ViewModel, that requires unit testing. The VM then becomes a dumb container that requires little, if any, testing. This is a good thing as the VM is just a bridge, between the designer and the coder, so should be kept simple. Even in MVVM, controllers will typically contain all processing logic and decide what data to display in which views using which view models. From what we have seen so far the main benefit of the ViewModel pattern to remove code from XAML code-behind to make XAML editing a more independent task. We still create controllers, as and when needed, to control (no pun intended) the overall logic of our applications. The basic MVCVM guidelines we follow are: Views display a certain shape of data. They have no idea where the data comes from. ViewModels hold a certain shape of data and commands, they do not know where the data, or code, comes from or how it is displayed. Models hold the actual data (various context, store or other methods) Controllers listen for, and publish, events. Controllers provide the logic that controls what data is seen and where. Controllers provide the command code to the ViewModel so that the ViewModel is actually reusable. We also noted that the Sculpture code-gen framework implements MVVM and a pattern similar to Prism AND it also makes extensive use of controllers to separate all use-case logic. Don't assume controllers are made obsolete by View-models. I have started a blog on this topic which I will add to as and when I can. There are issues with combining MVCVM with the common navigation systems, as most navigation systems just use Views and VMs, but I will go into that in later articles. An additional benefit of using an MVCVM model is that only the controller objects need to exist in memory for the life of the application and the controllers contain mainly code and little state data (i.e. tiny memory overhead). This makes for much less memory-intensive apps than solutions where view-models have to be retained and it is ideal for certain types of mobile development (e.g. Windows Mobile using Silverlight/Prism/MEF). This does of course depend on the type of application as you may still need to retain the occasional cached VMs for responsiveness. Note: This post has been edited numerous times, and did not specifically target the narrow question asked, so I have updated the first part to now cover that too. Much of the discussion, in comments below, relates only to ASP.Net and not the broader picture. This post was intended to cover the broader use of MVVM in Silverlight, WPF and ASP.Net and try avoid people replacing controllers with ViewModels.","The difference between MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is not a mutually exclusive choice.

3642919,javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException: View could not be restored,"Introduction The <code>ViewExpiredException</code> will be thrown whenever the <code>javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD</code> is set to <code>server</code> (default) and the enduser sends a HTTP POST request on a view via <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;h:commandLink&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h:commandButton&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;f:ajax&gt;</code>, while the associated view state isn't available in the session anymore. The view state is identified as value of a hidden input field <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> of the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code>. With the state saving method set to <code>server</code>, this contains only the view state ID which references a serialized view state in the session. So, when the session is expired for some reason (either timed out in server or client side, or the session cookie is not maintained anymore for some reason in browser, or by calling <code>HttpSession#invalidate()</code> in server, or due a server specific bug with session cookies as known in WildFly), then the serialized view state is not available anymore in the session and the enduser will get this exception. To understand the working of the session, see also How do servlets work? Instantiation, sessions, shared variables and multithreading. There is also a limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session. When the limit is hit, then the least recently used view will be expired. See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. With the state saving method set to <code>client</code>, the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden input field contains instead the whole serialized view state, so the enduser won't get a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when the session expires. It can however still happen on a cluster environment (""ERROR: MAC did not verify"" is symptomatic) and/or when there's a implementation-specific timeout on the client side state configured and/or when server re-generates the AES key during restart, see also Getting ViewExpiredException in clustered environment while state saving method is set to client and user session is valid how to solve it. Regardless of the solution, make sure you do not use <code>enableRestoreView11Compatibility</code>. it does not at all restore the original view state. It basically recreates the view and all associated view scoped beans from scratch and hereby thus losing all of original data (state). As the application will behave in a confusing way (""Hey, where are my input values..?? ""), this is very bad for user experience. Better use stateless views or <code>&lt;o:enableRestorableView&gt;</code> instead so you can manage it on a specific view only instead of on all views. As to the why JSF needs to save view state, head to this answer: Why JSF saves the state of UI components on server? Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page navigation In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when e.g. navigating back after logout when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, only redirecting the POST request after logout is not sufficient. You also need to instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, otherwise the browser may show them from the cache instead of requesting a fresh one from the server when you send a GET request on it (e.g. by back button). The <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field of the cached page may contain a view state ID value which is not valid anymore in the current session. If you're (ab)using POST (command links/buttons) instead of GET (regular links/buttons) for page-to-page navigation, and click such a command link/button on the cached page, then this will in turn fail with a <code>ViewExpiredException</code>. To fire a redirect after logout in JSF 2.0, either add <code>&lt;redirect /&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;navigation-case&gt;</code> in question (if any), or add <code>?faces-redirect=true</code> to the <code>outcome</code> value. or To instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, create a <code>Filter</code> which is mapped on the servlet name of the <code>FacesServlet</code> and adds the needed response headers to disable the browser cache. E.g. Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page refresh In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when refreshing the current page when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, you not only need to make sure you are performing page-to-page navigation exclusively by GET (regular links/buttons), but you also need to make sure that you are exclusively using ajax to submit the forms. If you're submitting the form synchronously (non-ajax) anyway, then you'd best either make the view stateless (see later section), or to send a redirect after POST (see previous section). Having a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> on page refresh is in default configuration a very rare case. It can only happen when the limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session is hit. So, it will only happen when you've manually set that limit way too low, or that you're continuously creating new views in background (e.g. by a badly implemented poll). See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. Another cause is having duplicate JSF libraries in runtime classpath conflicting each other. The correct procedure to install JSF is outlined in our JSF wiki page. Handling ViewExpiredException When you want to handle an unavoidable <code>ViewExpiredException</code> after a POST action on an arbitrary page which was already opened in some browser tab/window while you're logged out in another tab/window, then you'd like to specify an <code>error-page</code> for that in <code>web.xml</code> which goes to a ""Your session is timed out"" page. E.g. Use if necessary a meta refresh header in the error page in case you intend to actually redirect further to home or login page. (the <code>0</code> in <code>content</code> represents the amount of seconds before redirect, <code>0</code> thus means ""redirect immediately"", you can use e.g. <code>3</code> to let the browser wait 3 seconds with the redirect) Note that handling exceptions during ajax requests requires a special <code>ExceptionHandler</code>. See also Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request. You can find a live example at OmniFaces <code>FullAjaxExceptionHandler</code> showcase page (this also covers non-ajax requests). Also note that your ""general"" error page should be mapped on <code>&lt;error-code&gt;</code> of <code>500</code> instead of an <code>&lt;exception-type&gt;</code> of e.g. <code>java.lang.Exception</code> or <code>java.lang.Throwable</code>, otherwise all exceptions wrapped in <code>ServletException</code> such as <code>ViewExpiredException</code> would still end up in the general error page. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml. Stateless views A completely different alternative is to run JSF views in stateless mode. This way nothing of JSF state will be saved and the views will never expire, but just be rebuilt from scratch on every request. You can turn on stateless views by setting the <code>transient</code> attribute of <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>: This way the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field will get a fixed value of <code>""stateless""</code> in Mojarra (have not checked MyFaces at this point). Note that this feature was introduced in Mojarra 2.1.19 and 2.2.0 and is not available in older versions. The consequence is that you cannot use view scoped beans anymore. They will now behave like request scoped beans. One of the disadvantages is that you have to track the state yourself by fiddling with hidden inputs and/or loose request parameters. Mainly those forms with input fields with <code>rendered</code>, <code>readonly</code> or <code>disabled</code> attributes which are controlled by ajax events will be affected. Note that the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> does not necessarily need to be unique throughout the view and/or reside in the master template only. It's also completely legit to redeclare and nest it in a template client. It basically ""extends"" the parent <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> then. E.g. in master template: and in template client: You can even wrap the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;c:if&gt;</code> to make it conditional. Note that it would apply on the entire view, not only on the nested contents, such as the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> in above example. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml Check if session exists JSF Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request Unrelated to the concrete problem, using HTTP POST for pure page-to-page navigation isn't very user/SEO friendly. In JSF 2.0 you should really prefer <code>&lt;h:link&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h:button&gt;</code> over the <code>&lt;h:commandXxx&gt;</code> ones for plain vanilla page-to-page navigation. So instead of e.g. better do See also When should I use h:outputLink instead of h:commandLink? Difference between h:button and h:commandButton How to navigate in JSF? How to make URL reflect current page (and not previous one)","The `ViewExpiredException` occurs when the view state is not available in the session, typically due to session expiration or timeout. This can happen when the `javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD` is set to `server` and the user sends a POST request on a view.

While it is nice to separate the UI from business and interaction logic, the 'pure' MVVM pattern and most available examples work best on singular views. Not sure about your designs, but most of my applications, however, contain pages and several (reusable) views and thus the ViewModels do need to interact to some degree. Using the page as controller would defeat the purpose of the MVVM altogether, so not using a ""VM-C"" approach for the underlying logic might result in .. well .. challenging constructs as the application matures. Even in VB-6 most of us probably stopped coding business logic into the Button event and started 'relaying' commands to a controller, right? I recently looked at many emerging framworks on that topic; my favorite clearly is the Magellan (at codeplex) approach. Happy coding! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel#References","The key difference between MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is that MVVM is better suited for singular views, while MVC or a variation like MVVMC (Model-View-ViewModel-Controller) may be more suitable for complex applications with multiple views that require interaction. In MVVM, the ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model, but when multiple views are involved, a controller-like component may be necessary to manage the interaction between ViewModels, making MVVMC a viable approach for enterprise and rapid application development.","MVVMC, or perhaps MVC+, seems to be a viable approach for enterprise as well as rapid application development.","MVVMC, or perhaps MVC+, seems to be a viable approach for enterprise as well as rapid application development."

It also doesn't account for the famous DontEnum bug in Internet Explorer where non-enumerable properties on the prototype chain cause locally declared properties with the same name to inherit their DontEnum attribute. Implementing <em>Object.keys()</em> will give you a more robust solution. <strong>EDIT:</strong> following a recent discussion with kangax, a well-known contributor to Prototype, I implemented the workaround for the DontEnum bug based on code for his <code>Object.forIn()</code> function found here.","To list the properties of a JavaScript object, you can use the `Object.keys()` method, introduced in ECMAScript 5th Edition, which is supported in modern browsers. For older browsers, a custom implementation can be used, but it's essential to account for issues like inherited properties and the ""DontEnum"" bug in Internet Explorer. A robust solution involves implementing `Object.keys()` with proper checks, such as `hasOwnProperty()`, to ensure accurate results.",Implementing <em>Object.keys()</em> will give you a more robust solution.,"As Sam Dutton answered, a new method for this very purpose has been introduced in ECMAScript 5th Edition. <code>Object.keys()</code> will do what you want and is supported in Firefox 4, Chrome 6, Safari 5 and IE 9.

890128,Why are Python lambdas useful?,"As stated above, the lambda operator in Python defines an anonymous function, and in Python functions are closures. It is important not to confuse the concept of closures with the operator lambda, which is merely syntactic methadone for them. When I started in Python a few years ago, I used lambdas a lot, thinking they were cool, along with list comprehensions. However, I wrote and have to maintain a big website written in Python, with on the order of several thousand function points. I've learnt from experience that lambdas might be OK to prototype things with, but offer nothing over inline functions (named closures) except for saving a few key-stokes, or sometimes not. Basically this boils down to several points: it is easier to read software that is explicitly written using meaningful names. Anonymous closures by definition cannot have a meaningful name, as they have no name. This brevity seems, for some reason, to also infect lambda parameters, hence we often see examples like lambda x: x+1 it is easier to reuse named closures, as they can be referred to by name more than once, when there is a name to refer to them by. it is easier to debug code that is using named closures instead of lambdas, because the name will appear in tracebacks, and around the error. That's enough reason to round them up and convert them to named closures. However, I hold two other grudges against anonymous closures. The first grudge is simply that they are just another unnecessary keyword cluttering up the language. The second grudge is deeper and on the paradigm level, i.e. I do not like that they promote a functional-programming style, because that style is less flexible than the message passing, object oriented or procedural styles, because the lambda calculus is not Turing-complete (luckily in Python, we can still break out of that restriction even inside a lambda). The reasons I feel lambdas promote this style are: There is an implicit return, i.e. they seem like they 'should' be functions. They are an alternative state-hiding mechanism to another, more explicit, more readable, more reusable and more general mechanism: methods. I try hard to write lambda-free Python, and remove lambdas on sight. I think Python would be a slightly better language without lambdas, but that's just my opinion.","The answerer believes Python lambdas are not particularly useful and can even be detrimental to code readability and maintainability. They argue that named closures are preferable because they are more readable, reusable, and easier to debug, with the name appearing in tracebacks. The answerer also dislikes lambdas for promoting a functional programming style, which they consider less flexible, and thinks Python would be better without them.",,"I've learnt from experience that lambdas might be OK to prototype things with, but offer nothing over inline functions (named closures) except for saving a few key-stokes, or sometimes not."
1074081,Hibernate Error: org.hibernate.NonUniqueObjectException: a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session,"This is only one point where hibernate makes more problems than it solves. In my case there are many objects with the same identifier 0, because they are new and don't have one. The db generates them. Somewhere I have read that 0 signals Id not set. The intuitive way to persist them is iterating over them and saying hibernate to save the objects. But You can't do that - ""Of course You should know that hibernate works this and that way, therefore You have to.."" So now I can try to change Ids to Long instead of long and look if it then works. In the end it's easier to do it with a simple mapper by your own, because hibernate is just an additional intransparent burden. Another example: Trying to read parameters from one database and persist them in another forces you to do nearly all work manually. But if you have to do it anyway, using hibernate is just additional work.","The `NonUniqueObjectException` occurs when Hibernate encounters multiple objects with the same identifier (in this case, 0) that haven't been saved yet.

Even if you put code inside the main function, you are not required to write it exactly as that.

4062001,CSS3 Border Opacity?,"Unfortunately the <code>opacity</code> element makes the whole element (including any text) semi-transparent.

For example, this would give a red border with 50% opacity: The problem with this approach is that some browsers do not understand the <code>rgba</code> format and will not display any border at all if this is the entire declaration. The solution is to provide two border declarations. The first with a fake opacity, and the second with the actual. If a browser is capable, it will use the second, if not, it will use the first. The first border declaration will be the equivalent color to a 50% opaque red border over a white background (although any graphics under the border will not bleed through). UPDATE: I've added ""background-clip: padding-box;"" to this answer (per  SooDesuNe's suggestion in the comments) to ensure the border remains transparent even if a solid background color is applied.","To achieve a semi-transparent border in CSS3, use the `rgba` color format, but provide a fallback by declaring two borders: one for browsers that don't support `rgba` and another with the desired opacity.

Inside a method, I had something like: Now in my JSP page, I called that method and used the List object returned by it. The List object is backed by that ""foos"" array; but, the array went out of scope when I returned from the method (since it is a local variable). So shortly after returning, the garbage collector swept away the ""foos"" array, and my access to the List caused a NullPointerException since its underlying array was now wiped away. I actually wondered, as I wrote the above method, whether that would happen. The even deeper underlying problem was premature optimization. I wanted a list, but I knew I would have exactly 20 elements, so I figured I'd try to be more efficient than <code>new ArrayList&lt;Foo&gt;(20)</code> which only sets an initial size of 20 but can possibly be less efficient than the method I used.

529085,How to create a generic array in Java?,"Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): That compiles without warnings, and as you can see in <code>main</code>, for whatever type you declare an instance of <code>GenSet</code> as, you can assign <code>a</code> to an array of that type, and you can assign an element from <code>a</code> to a variable of that type, meaning that the array and the values in the array are of the correct type. It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials. Class literals are treated by the compiler as instances of <code>java.lang.Class</code>. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with <code>.class</code>. So, <code>String.class</code> acts as a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>. This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. <code>String[].class</code>), primitives (e.g. <code>int.class</code>), and the keyword <code>void</code> (i.e. <code>void.class</code>). <code>Class</code> itself is generic (declared as <code>Class&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> stands for the type that the <code>Class</code> object is representing), meaning that the type of <code>String.class</code> is <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>. So, whenever you call the constructor for <code>GenSet</code>, you pass in a class literal for the first argument representing an array of the <code>GenSet</code> instance's declared type (e.g. <code>String[].class</code> for <code>GenSet&lt;String&gt;</code>). Note that you won't be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can't be used for type variables. Inside the constructor, calling the method <code>cast</code> returns the passed <code>Object</code> argument cast to the class represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called. Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument. Calling the method <code>getComponentType</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the component type of the array represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called (e.g. <code>String.class</code> for <code>String[].class</code>, <code>null</code> if the <code>Class</code> object doesn't represent an array). That last sentence isn't entirely accurate. Calling <code>String[].class.getComponentType()</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>, but its type is <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, not <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>, which is why you can't do something like the following. Same goes for every method in <code>Class</code> that returns a <code>Class</code> object. Regarding Joachim Sauer's comment on this answer (I don't have enough reputation to comment on it myself), the example using the cast to <code>T[]</code> will result in a warning because the compiler can't guarantee type safety in that case. Edit regarding Ingo's comments:","To create a generic array in Java, you can use class literals as runtime type tokens. This involves passing a class literal, such as `String[].class`, to a constructor, which then uses the `java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance` method to create an array of the specified type. This approach preserves type safety and avoids warnings at compile time. The `Class` object is generic, allowing it to represent the type of the array, and the `getComponentType` method can be used to get the component type of the array. However, note that you cannot create an array of primitives using this method, and some methods in the `","So, <code>String.class</code> acts as a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>.","Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youÃ©ÂÂ¥Ã¦ÂªÂe looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time): It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials.

Then after all the input has been read, <code>getchar()</code> will return <code>EOF</code>, and hence <code>getchar() != EOF</code> will be false, and the loop will terminate.

The <code>!=</code> operator means ""not equal"". 0 stands for false, and anything else stands for true. So what happens is, we call the <code>getchar()</code> function, and compare the result to -1 (EOF). If the result was not equal to EOF, then the result is true, because things that are not equal are not equal.

4370960,What is attr_accessor in Ruby?,"attr_accessor is just a method. (The link should provide more insight with how it works - look at the pairs of methods generated, and a tutorial should show you how to use it.) The trick is that <code>class</code> is not a definition in Ruby (it is ""just a definition"" in languages like C++ and Java), but it is an expression that evaluates. It is during this evaluation when the <code>attr_accessor</code> method is invoked which in turn modifies the current class - remember the implicit receiver: <code>self.attr_accessor</code>, where <code>self</code> is the ""open"" class object at this point. The need for <code>attr_accessor</code> and friends, is, well: Ruby, like Smalltalk, does not allow instance variables to be accessed outside of methods1 for that object. That is, instance variables cannot be accessed in the <code>x.y</code> form as is common in say, Java or even Python. In Ruby <code>y</code> is always taken as a message to send (or ""method to call""). Thus the <code>attr_*</code> methods create wrappers which proxy the instance <code>@variable</code> access through dynamically created methods. Boilerplate sucks Hope this clarifies some of the little details. Happy coding. 1 This isn't strictly true and there are some ""techniques"" around this, but there is no syntax support for ""public instance variable"" access.","In Ruby, `attr_accessor` is a method that dynamically creates getter and setter methods for instance variables, allowing them to be accessed outside of the object.

Works the same way! And guess what: the instance variable <code>@name</code> in our person object will be set just like when we did it manually, so you can use it in other methods. That's it. In order to understand how <code>attr_reader</code>, <code>attr_writer</code>, and <code>attr_accessor</code> methods actually generate methods for you, read other answers, books, ruby docs.","In Ruby, `attr_accessor` is a method that automatically generates both reader and writer methods for an instance variable, allowing you to access and modify its value. It combines the functionality of `attr_reader` and `attr_writer`, eliminating the need to manually define these methods.",Those are two different methods. The former is called reader and latter is called writer. When you want both reader and writer just use accessor!,

","The main difference between px, dip, dp, and sp is how they relate to screen density and user preferences. 

- **px** (pixels) corresponds to actual screen pixels.
- **dp** (density-independent pixels) or **dip** is an abstract unit based on screen density, with 1 dp equal to 1 pixel on a 160 dpi screen.
- **sp** (scale-independent pixels) is similar to dp but also scales with the user's font size preference.

417142,What is the maximum length of a URL in different browsers?,"<h2>Short answer - de facto limit of 2000 characters</h2>
<p>If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software, and any search engine.</p>
<p>For specific use cases, longer URLs can be considered. Outside of search engines, 8000 characters offers wide compatibility as of 2023. Read on for all the details...</p>
<h2>Longer answer - first, the standards...</h2>
<p>The original HTTP/1.1 specification, published in 1999, <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 2616</a>, said in section 3.2.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP protocol does not place
any a priori limit on the length of
a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
the URI of any resource they    serve,
and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
unbounded length if they    provide
GET-based forms that could generate
such URIs. A server    SHOULD return
414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
URI is longer    than the server can
handle (see section 10.4.15).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, this was obsoleted by an updated specification largely to match actual usage, <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.1.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 7230</a>; it suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in
practice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients
support, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2022, a new update was published, defining HTTP semantics independently of HTTP version (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3). <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.1-5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 9110, section 4.1</a>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that all senders and recipients support, at a minimum, URIs with lengths of 8000 octets in protocol elements. Note that this implies some structures and on-wire representations (for example, the request line in HTTP/1.1) will necessarily be larger in some cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>...and the reality</h2>
<p>That's what the <em>standards</em> say.

The executive summary is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters

browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of

<p>I've tested IE10 and the address bar will only accept 2083 chars. You can <em>click</em> a URL which is longer than this, but the address bar will still only show 2083 characters of this link.</p>

<p>There are mixed reports IE11 supports longer URLs - see comments below. Given some people report issues, the general advice still stands.</p>

<p>Be aware that the <a href=""http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sitemaps protocol</a>, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL.

292357,What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?,"<p>It is important to contrast the design philosophy of git with the philosophy of a more traditional source control tool like SVN.</p>

<p>Subversion was designed and built with a client/server model. There is a single repository that is the server, and several clients can fetch code from the server, work on it, then commit it back to the server. The assumption is that the client can always contact the server when it needs to perform an operation.</p>

<p>Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the ""server"" don't need to be online at the same time. Git was designed so that people on an unreliable link could exchange code via email, even. It is possible to work completely disconnected and burn a CD to exchange code via git.</p>

<p>In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. By keeping a copy of the remote repository locally, git can figure out the changes needed even when the remote repository is not reachable.  Later when you need to send the changes to someone else, git can transfer them as a set of changes from a point in time known to the remote repository.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> is the command that says ""bring my local copy of the remote repository up to date."" </p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>git pull</code></strong> says ""bring the changes in the remote repository to where I keep my own code.""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Normally <strong><code>git pull</code></strong> does this by doing a <strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.</p>

<p>The take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least <strong>three copies</strong> of a project on your workstation. One copy is your own repository with your own commit history. The second copy is your working copy where you are editing and building. The third copy is your local ""cached"" copy of a remote repository.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Supporting Multiple Screens</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Screen size</strong><br/>
Actual physical size, measured as the screen's diagonal.
For simplicity, Android groups all actual screen sizes into four
generalized sizes: small, normal, large, and extra-large.</p>
<p><strong>Screen density</strong><br/>
The number of pixels within a physical area of the
screen; usually referred to as dpi (dots per inch). For example, a
&quot;low&quot; density screen has fewer pixels within a given physical area,
compared to a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;high&quot; density screen. For simplicity,
Android groups all actual screen densities into six generalized
densities: low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high, and
extra-extra-extra-high.</p>
<p><strong>Orientation</strong><br/>The orientation of the screen from the user's point of
view. This is either landscape or portrait, meaning that the screen's
aspect ratio is either wide or tall, respectively. Be aware that not
only do different devices operate in different orientations by
default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user
rotates the device.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong><br/> The total number of physical pixels on
a screen. When adding support for multiple screens, applications do
not work directly with resolution; applications should be concerned
only with screen size and density, as specified by the generalized
size and density groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Density-independent pixel (dp)</strong><br/> A virtual
pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express
layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way.
The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160
dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a
&quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles
any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density
of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:
<code>px = dp * (dpi / 160)</code>.
For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp
equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when
defining your application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on
screens with different densities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are at all serious about developing an Android app for more than one type of device, you should have read the screens support development document at least once. In addition to that, it is always a good thing to know the actual number of active devices that have a particular screen configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Screen Sizes and Densities</a></li>
</ul>
","The main difference between px, dip, dp, and sp is how they relate to screen density and size. 

- **px (pixel)** is a physical pixel on the screen.
- **dp (density-independent pixel)** is a virtual pixel unit that scales with screen density, equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen.
- **dip** is an older term for dp.
- **sp (scale-independent pixel)** is similar to dp but also scales with the user's preferred font size.

<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode"" rel=""noreferrer"">JavaScript strict mode</a> is a feature in <a href=""https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ECMAScript 5</a>. You can enable the strict mode by declaring this in the top of your script/function.</p>

<p>In their obsession to line up the numeric literals, the developer has inadvertently initialized variable <code>b</code> with an octal literal. Non-strict mode will interpret this as a numeric literal with value <code>24</code> (in base 10). However, strict mode will throw an error.</p>

<li><p>In my <em>new</em> JavaScript application: <strong>Absolutely!</strong> Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In my <em>existing</em> JavaScript code: <strong>Probably not!</strong> If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break.

<li><p>Insert a <code>'use strict';</code> statement on top of your script:</p>
<pre><code> // File: myscript.js

 'use strict';

 ....
</code></pre>
<p>Note that everything in the file <code>myscript.js</code> will be interpreted in strict mode.</p>

<p>Everything in the <em>lexical scope</em> of function <code>doSomething</code> will be interpreted in strict mode. The word <em>lexical scope</em> is important here.

<h2>What things are prohibited in strict mode?</h2>
<p>I found a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20200704094929/http://yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/"" rel=""noreferrer"">nice article</a> describing several things that are prohibited in strict mode (note that this is not an exhaustive list):</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Historically, JavaScript has been confused about how functions
are scoped. Sometimes they seem to be statically scoped, but some
features make them behave like they are dynamically scoped. This is
confusing, making programs difficult to read and understand.
Misunderstanding causes bugs. It also is a problem for performance.
Static scoping would permit variable binding to happen at compile
time, but the requirement for dynamic scope means the binding must be
deferred to runtime, which comes with a significant performance
penalty.</p>
<p>Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically.
That means that the features that previously required dynamic binding
must be eliminated or modified. Specifically, the with statement is
eliminated, and the eval function’s ability to tamper with the
environment of its caller is severely restricted.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of strict code is that tools like <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/"" rel=""noreferrer"">YUI Compressor</a>
can do a better job when processing it.</p>
<h2>Implied Global Variables</h2>
<p>JavaScript has implied global variables. If
you do not explicitly declare a variable, a global variable is
implicitly declared for you. This makes programming easier for
beginners because they can neglect some of their basic housekeeping
chores. But it makes the management of larger programs much more
difficult and it significantly degrades reliability. So in strict
mode, implied global variables are no longer created. You should
explicitly declare all of your variables.</p>
<h2>Global Leakage</h2>
<p>There are a number of situations that could cause <code>this</code>
to be bound to the global object. For example, if you forget to
provide the <code>new</code> prefix when calling a constructor function, the
constructor's <code>this</code> will be bound unexpectedly to the global object, so
instead of initializing a new object, it will instead be silently
tampering with global variables. In these situations, strict mode will
instead bind <code>this</code> to <code>undefined</code>, which will cause the constructor to
throw an exception instead, allowing the error to be detected much
sooner.</p>
<h2>Noisy Failure</h2>
<p>JavaScript has always had read-only properties, but you
could not create them yourself until ES5’s <code>Object.createProperty</code>
function exposed that capability. If you attempted to assign a value
to a read-only property, it would fail silently. The assignment would
not change the property’s value, but your program would proceed as
though it had. This is an integrity hazard that can cause programs to
go into an inconsistent state. In strict mode, attempting to change a
read-only property will throw an exception.</p>
<h2>Octal</h2>
<p>The octal (or base 8) representation of numbers was extremely
useful when doing machine-level programming on machines whose word
sizes were a multiple of 3. You needed octal when working with the CDC
6600 mainframe, which had a word size of 60 bits. If you could read
octal, you could look at a word as 20 digits. Two digits represented
the op code, and one digit identified one of 8 registers. During the
slow transition from machine codes to high level languages, it was
thought to be useful to provide octal forms in programming languages.</p>
<p>In C, an extremely unfortunate representation of octalness was
selected: Leading zero. So in C, <code>0100</code> means 64, not 100, and <code>08</code> is an
error, not 8. Even more unfortunately, this anachronism has been
copied into nearly all modern languages, including JavaScript, where
it is only used to create errors. It has no other purpose. So in
strict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed.</p>
<h2>Et cetera</h2>
<p>The arguments pseudo array becomes a little bit more
array-like in ES5. In strict mode, it loses its <code>callee</code> and <code>caller</code>
properties. This makes it possible to pass your <code>arguments</code> to untrusted
code without giving up a lot of confidential context. Also, the
<code>arguments</code> property of functions is eliminated.</p>
<p>In strict mode, duplicate keys in a function literal will produce a
syntax error. A function can’t have two parameters with the same name.
A function can’t have a variable with the same name as one of its
parameters. A function can’t <code>delete</code> its own variables. An attempt to
<code>delete</code> a non-configurable property now throws an exception. Primitive
values are not implicitly wrapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Reserved words for future JavaScript versions</h2>
<p>ECMAScript 5 adds a list of reserved words. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error. The reserved words are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>implements</code>, <code>interface</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>package</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>yield</code></p>

","The ""use strict"" directive in JavaScript enables strict mode, which helps catch potential bugs by throwing errors for certain coding practices. It was introduced in ECMAScript 5 to improve code quality and prevent common mistakes, such as implicit global variables, octal literals, and silent failures.

At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp
units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use.
The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi

","To achieve consistent sizing across different screen densities in Android, use `dp` (or `dip`) for layout measurements like margin and padding, and `sp` specifically for text size. `px` is not recommended as it doesn't scale with screen density. Android automatically translates these units into pixels at runtime.","See the difference between <code>px</code>, <code>dp</code> and <code>sp</code> on different screen sizes.","<code>dp</code> is  <code>dip</code>.

git-pull - Fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch
SYNOPSIS

git pull   …
DESCRIPTION

Runs git-fetch with the given parameters, and calls git-merge to merge the 
retrieved head(s) into the current branch. With --rebase, calls git-rebase 
instead of git-merge.

Note that you can use . (current directory) as the &lt;repository> to pull 
from the local repository — this is useful when merging local branches 
into the current branch.

Also note that options meant for git-pull itself and underlying git-merge 
must be given before the options meant for git-fetch.

<p>By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is
also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that
you are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using
the --tags or --no-tags options or by configuring
remote..tagOpt. By using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly,
you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested
in as well.</p>
<p>git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository or URL or
from several repositories at once if  is given and there is a

<p>When no remote is specified, by default the origin remote will be
used, unless there’s an upstream branch configured for the current

5sp. The following units of measure are supported by Android:</p>
<p><strong>dp</strong></p>
<p>Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the
physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a 160 dpi
(dots per inch) screen, on which 1dp is roughly equal to 1px. When
running on a higher density screen, the number of pixels used to draw
1dp is scaled up by a factor appropriate for the screen's dpi.
Likewise, when on a lower density screen, the number of pixels used
for 1dp is scaled down. The ratio of dp-to-pixel will change with the
screen density, but not necessarily in direct proportion. Using dp
units (instead of px units) is a simple solution to making the view
dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen
densities. In other words, it provides consistency for the real-world
sizes of your UI elements across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>sp</strong></p>
<p>Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended that you use
this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for
both the screen density and the user's preference.</p>
<p><strong>pt</strong></p>
<p>Points - 1/72 of an inch based on the physical size of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>px</strong></p>
<p>Pixels - Corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. This unit of
measure is not recommended because the actual representation can vary
across devices; each device may have a different number of pixels per
inch and may have more or fewer total pixels available on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>mm</strong></p>
<p>Millimeters - Based on the physical size of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>in</strong></p>
<p>Inches - Based on the physical size of the screen.</p>

<em>(Keeping in mind that pictures speak louder than words!, I have provided pictorial representation)</em></p>
<p>Let's take an example that you are working on a project with your team members. So there will be one main Branch of the project and all the contributors must fork it to their own local repository and then work on this local branch to modify/Add modules then push back to the main branch.</p>
<p>So,
<strong>Initial State</strong> of the two Branches when you forked the main project on your local repository will be like this- (<code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are Modules already completed of the project)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/SPky3.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SPky3.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you have started working on the new module (suppose <code>D</code>)  and when you have completed the <code>D</code> module you want to push it to the main branch, But meanwhile what happens is that one of your teammates has developed new Module <code>E</code>, <code>F</code> and modified <code>C</code>.<br>
So now what has happened is that your local repository is lacking behind the original progress of the project and thus pushing of your changes to the main branch can lead to conflict and may cause your Module <code>D</code> to malfunction.</p>

<p>To avoid such issues and to work parallel with the original progress of the project there are Two ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Git Fetch-</strong> This will Download all the changes that have been made to the origin/main branch project which are not present in your local branch. And will wait for the Git Merge command to apply the changes that have been fetched to your Repository or branch.</p>

","The main difference between `git pull` and `git fetch` is how they handle updating your local repository with changes from the remote repository. `git fetch` downloads the changes from the remote repository, but doesn't merge them into your local branch, allowing you to review and resolve conflicts before merging.

<p>From this awesome <a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-fetch"" rel=""noreferrer"">Atlassian tutorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>git fetch</code> command downloads commits, files, and refs from a
remote repository into your local repository.</p>
<p>Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody <em>else</em> has
been working on. It’s similar to SVN update in that it lets you see
how the central history has progressed, but it doesn’t force you to
actually merge the changes into your repository. Git <strong>isolates
fetched content as a from existing local content</strong>, it has absolutely
<strong>no effect on your local development work</strong>. Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the <code>git checkout</code> command. This makes
fetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with
your local repository.</p>
<p>When downloading content from a remote repository, <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code> commands are available to accomplish the task. You can consider
<code>git fetch</code> the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download
the remote content, but not update your local repository's working state,
leaving your current work intact. <code>git pull</code> is the more aggressive
alternative, it will download the remote content for the active local
branch and immediately execute <code>git merge</code> to create a merge commit
for the new remote content. If you have pending changes in progress
this will cause conflicts and kickoff the merge conflict resolution
flow.</p>

<p>With <code>git pull</code>:</p>

<li>The merging step will affect your local development and <em>may</em> cause conflicts</li>
<li>It's basically NOT safe. It's aggressive.</li>
<li>Unlike <code>git fetch</code> where it only affects your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code>, git pull will affect both your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>.git/refs/heads/</code></li>

<p><strong>Hmmm...so if I'm not updating the working copy with <code>git fetch</code>, then where am I making changes? Where does Git fetch store the new commits?</strong></p>
<p>Great question. First and foremost, the <code>heads</code> or <code>remotes</code> don't store the new commits. They just have <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3965676/why-did-my-git-repo-enter-a-detached-head-state/65847406#65847406"">pointers</a> to commits.

It's still isolated from your working copy, because your branch's pointer in the <code>heads</code> directory hasn't updated. It will only update upon a <code>merge</code>/<code>pull</code>. But again where? Let's find out.</p>
<p>In your project directory (i.e., where you do your <code>git</code> commands) do:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>ls</code>. This will show the files &amp; directories. Nothing cool, I know.</p>

<h2>To see the actual difference</h2>
<p>Just do:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin master

<p>If the remote master was updated you'll get a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to update your local branch)
</code></pre>
<p>If you didn't <code>fetch</code> and just did <code>git checkout master</code> then your local git wouldn't know that there are 2 commits added. And it would just say:</p>
<pre><code>Already on 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

<p>But that's outdated and incorrect. It's because git will give you feedback solely based on what it knows. It's oblivious to new commits that it hasn't pulled down yet...</p>
<hr />
<h2>Is there any way to see the new changes made in remote while working on the branch locally?</h2>
<p>Some IDEs (e.g. Xcode) are super smart and use the result of a <code>git fetch</code> and can annotate the lines of code that have been changed in remote branch of your current working branch. If that line has been changed by both local changes and remote branch, then that line gets annotated with red. This isn't a merge conflict. It's a <em>potential</em> merge conflict. It's a headsup that you can use to resolve the future merge conflict before doing <code>git pull</code> from the remote branch.</p>

1335851,"What does ""use strict"" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?","<p>I would like to offer a somewhat more founded answer complementing the other answers. I was hoping to edit the most popular answer, but failed. I tried to make it as comprehensive and complete as I could.</p>
<p>You can refer to the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode"" rel=""noreferrer"">MDN documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p><code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code> a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5.</p>
<p>Directives are similar to statements, yet different.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>use strict</code> does not contain key words: The directive is a simple expression statement, which consists of a special string literal (in single or double quotes). JavaScript engines, that do not implement ECMAScript 5, merely see an expression statement without side effects. It is expected that future versions of ECMAScript standards introduce <code>use</code> as a real key word; the quotes would thereby become obsolete.</li>
<li><code>use strict</code> can be used only at the beginning of a script or of a function, i.e. it must precede every other (real) statement. It does not have to be the first instruction in a script of function: it can be preceded by other statement expressions that consist of string literals ( and JavaScript implementations can treat them as implementation specific directives). String literals statements, which follow a first real statement (in a script or function) are simple expression statements. Interpreters must not interpret them as directives and they have no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>use strict</code> directive indicates that the following code (in a script or a function) is strict code.
The code in the highest level of a script (code that is not in a function) is considered strict code when the script contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
The content of a function is considered strict code when the function itself is defined in a strict code or when the function contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
Code that is passed to an <code>eval()</code> method is considered strict code when <code>eval()</code> was called from a strict code or contains the <code>use strict</code> directive itself.</p>
<p>The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important):</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode.</li>

","The `""use strict""` directive in JavaScript, introduced in ECMAScript 5, enables strict mode, which is a restricted subset of the language with more stringent error checking and higher security. When used at the beginning of a script or function, it eliminates certain deficits of the language, such as implicit global variable declarations and sloppy `this` behavior. Key differences between strict mode and normal mode include: 

- Requiring variable declarations
- Restricting the use of `with` statements
- Modifying `this` behavior in functions
- Preventing assignments to readonly properties
- Limiting `eval()` scope
- Disallow","<code>""use strict""</code> a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5. The <code>use strict</code> directive indicates that the following code (in a script or a function) is strict code. The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode.","I would like to offer a somewhat more founded answer complementing the other answers.

<h3>Density-independent pixel (dp)</h3>
<p>A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. As described above, the density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a &quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:</p>
<p>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</p>
<p>For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure
proper display of your UI on screens with different densities.</p>
<p>Understanding pixel to dp and vice versa is very essential (especially for giving exact dp values to creative team)</p>
<pre><code>dp = px * 160 / dpi

MDPI = 160 dpi || Therefore, on MDPI 1 px = 1 dp
For example, if you want to convert 20 pixel to dp, use the above formula,
dp = 20 * 160 / 160 = 20.
So, 20 pixel = 20 dp.

HDPI = 240 dpi - So, on HDPI 1.5 px = 1 dp
XHDPI = 320 dpi - So, on XHDPI 2 px = 1 dp
XXHDPI = 480 dpi - So, on XXHDPI 3 px = 1 dp

For example, let us consider Nexus 4.
If 24 pixels to be converted to dp and if it is a Nexus 4 screen, developers can
convert it to dp easily by the following calculation :
dp = 24 * 160 / 320 = 12 dp
Screen dimension:
768 x 1280 pixel resolution (320 ppi or 320dpi)
Optional (screen size):
 4.7&quot; diagonal
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Try to get all pixel values in even numbers from the creative team. Otherwise precision lose will happen while multiplying with 0.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>px</h3>
<p>It is explained above. Try to avoid in layout files. But there are some cases, where px is required. for example, ListView divider line. px is better here for giving a one-pixel line as a divider for all across screen resolutions.</p>
<h3>sp</h3>
<p>Use sp for font sizes. Then only the font inside the application will change while device fonts size changes (that is, Display -&gt; Fonts on Device). If you want to keep a static sized font inside the app, you can give the font dimension in dp. In such a case, it will never change. Developers may get such a requirement for some specific screens, for that, developers can use dp instead of sp. In all other cases, sp is recommended.</p>
","The main difference between px, dip (dp), and sp is how they scale on different screen densities. 

- **dp (density-independent pixel)**: A virtual pixel unit used for layout dimensions, scaled by the system based on screen density. 1 dp equals 1 physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen.
- **px (pixel)**: An actual screen pixel, not recommended for layout files, but useful for cases like a 1-pixel divider line.
- **sp (scale-independent pixel)**: Used for font sizes, scales with the device's font size setting, but can be replaced with dp for static font sizes",,"A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way.

<p>I have gone through the above answers...not finding them exactly correct.
sp for text size, dp for layout bounds - standard.
But <strong>sp for text size will break the layout if used carelessly</strong> in most of the devices.</p>
<p>sp take the text size of the device, whereas dp take that of device density standard( never change in a device)
Say 100sp text can occupy 80% of the screen or 100% of the screen depending on the font size set in the device</p>

<p>You can use sp for layout bounds also, it will work :)
<strong>No standard app use sp for whole text</strong></p>
<p>Use sp and dp for text size considering UX.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use sp for text in the toolbar( can use android dimens available for different screen sizes with dp)</li>
<li>Don't use sp for text in small bounded buttons, very smaller text, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people use huge FONT size in their phone for more readability, giving them small hardcoded sized text will be a UX issue. Put sp for text where necessary, but make sure it won't break the layout when the user changes his settings.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have a single app supporting all dimensions, adding xxxhdpi assets increases the app size a lot. But now xxxhdpi phones are common so we have to include xxxhdpi assets at least for icons in the sidebar, toolbar, and bottom bar. It's better to move to vector images to have a uniform and better quality images for all screen sizes.</p>
<p>Also, note that people use custom fonts on their phones. So lack of a font can cause problems regarding spacing and all. Say text size 12sp for a custom font may take some pixels extra than the default font.</p>

","The main difference between px, dip, dp, and sp is:

- `px` is a pixel
- `dip` or `dp` (density-independent pixels) is used for layout bounds and is based on the device's density standard
- `sp` (scale-independent pixels) is used for text size and takes into account the device's font size settings
- `dpi` (density pixels) refers to the device's screen density

Using `sp` for text size can be problematic if not done carefully, as it can cause layout issues on different devices with varying font sizes. It's recommended to use `sp",,"Most Android developers miss this while developing apps, so I am adding these points. sp for text size, dp for layout bounds - standard.

226910,How to sanity check a date in Java,"<p>As shown by @Maglob, the basic approach is to test the conversion from string to date using <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">SimpleDateFormat.parse</a>. That will catch invalid day/month combinations like 2008-02-31.</p>

<p>However, in practice that is rarely enough since SimpleDateFormat.parse is exceedingly liberal. There are two behaviours you might be concerned with:</p>

<p><strong>Invalid characters in the date string</strong>
Surprisingly, 2008-02-2x will ""pass"" as a valid date with locale format = ""yyyy-MM-dd"" for example. Even when isLenient==false.</p>

<p><strong>Years: 2, 3 or 4 digits?</strong>
You may also want to enforce 4-digit years rather than allowing the default SimpleDateFormat behaviour (which will interpret ""12-02-31"" differently depending on whether your format was ""yyyy-MM-dd"" or ""yy-MM-dd"")</p>

<h2>A Strict Solution with the Standard Library</h2>

<p>So a complete string to date test could look like this: a combination of regex match, and then a forced date conversion. The trick with the regex is to make it locale-friendly.</p>

<pre><code>  Date parseDate(String maybeDate, String format, boolean lenient) {
    Date date = null;

    // test date string matches format structure using regex
    // - weed out illegal characters and enforce 4-digit year
    // - create the regex based on the local format string
    String reFormat = Pattern.compile(""d+|M+"").matcher(Matcher.quoteReplacement(format)).replaceAll(""\\\\d{1,2}"");
    reFormat = Pattern.compile(""y+"").matcher(reFormat).replaceAll(""\\\\d{4}"");
    if ( Pattern.compile(reFormat).matcher(maybeDate).matches() ) {

      // date string matches format structure, 
      // - now test it can be converted to a valid date
      SimpleDateFormat sdf = (SimpleDateFormat)DateFormat.getDateInstance();
      sdf.applyPattern(format);
      sdf.setLenient(lenient);
      try { date = sdf.parse(maybeDate); } catch (ParseException e) { }
    } 
    return date;
  } 

  // used like this:
  Date date = parseDate( ""21/5/2009"", ""d/M/yyyy"", false);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the regex assumes the format string contains only day, month, year, and separator characters. Aside from that, format can be in any locale format: ""d/MM/yy"", ""yyyy-MM-dd"", and so on. The format string for the current locale could be obtained like this:</p>

<pre><code>Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
SimpleDateFormat sdf = (SimpleDateFormat)DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.SHORT, locale );
String format = sdf.toPattern();
</code></pre>

<h2>Joda Time - Better Alternative?</h2>

<p>I've been hearing about <a href=""http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">joda time</a> recently and thought I'd compare. Two points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Seems better at being strict about invalid characters in the date string, unlike SimpleDateFormat</li>

</ol>

<p>It's quite simple to use:</p>

<pre><code>import org.joda.time.format.*;

  org.joda.time.DateTime date = null;

","The `""use strict""` directive in JavaScript enables strict mode, which requires all variables to be defined before use, helping to avoid accidental global uses of undefined methods. It also improves code performance, throws fatal errors for warnings, and results in neater code. Introduced in ECMAScript 5, strict mode is enabled by default in ECMAScript 6, making the `""use strict""` declaration unnecessary in ES6.","With strict mode, you can not, for example,
  use undeclared variables.","<code>""use strict""</code> makes JavaScript code to run in <em>strict mode</em>, which basically means everything needs to be defined before use. The main reason for using strict mode is to avoid accidental global uses of undefined methods. Also in strict mode, things run faster, some warnings or silent warnings throw fatal errors, it's better to always use it to make a neater code. <code>""use strict""</code> is widely needed to be used in ECMA5, <strong>in ECMA6 it's part of JavaScript by default</strong>, so it doesn't need to be added if you're using ES6. The
  purpose of ""use strict"" is to indicate that the code should be
  executed in ""strict mode"". With strict mode, you can not, for example,
  use undeclared variables."

Yes, I know that it's somehow described in Google docs (and mentioned in the posts above), I read that but it was not good for me (yeah, I may be too stupid)). It remained unclear to me how to design layouts capable to handle different screen sizes. I hate the DP concept and so on when I need to implement a &quot;flexible&quot; UI layout for different screens. (Hey iOS developers - yes, you're right it's a Storyboard concept).</p>
<p>Android has not bad UI concept, but lacks iOS Storyboard features, unfortunately. Designing flexible UI in Android is not an easy thing (at the best).</p>
<p>Here goes the article that helped me to understand what to do in Android to make layouts for different screen sizes:</p>

<p><strong>How to Design UI for Android Apps for Different Screen Size</strong></p>
<p>To design an app UI for different screen sizes, our initial design has to
meet a minimum required space for each screen size. Android defines a
minimum size (in dp) for each generalized screen type. Here is an
Android screen size guideline.
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/MPEMR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/MPEMR.jpg"" alt=""Minimum Screen Size for Android in dp"" /></a>
When we get the screen size in dp, it is not enough for us to design
the Android app UI. For each screen size, we need to prepare graphics
and bitmap images for each density. Here is an Android screen density
guideline.
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Px14F.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Px14F.jpg"" alt=""Android Density Guideline (dpi)"" /></a></p>
<p>For easy calculation, we can follow the 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between
the four generalized densities. If we create a 36×36 pixel picture for
ldpi device, the rest densities pictures size will be 48×48 for mdpi,
72×72 for hdpi, and 96×96 for xhdpi.</p>
<p><strong>How to Design Android Apps UI in Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Many designers have problems designing Android app UI in photoshop or another pixel
based graphic design tools because of the density-independent unit, dp.
Designers don’t know how to map dp to pixel. Google also doesn’t give
a clear Android UI design guide for them, though they give a basic
formula for dp and pixel translation.</p>
<p>As Android’s definition, 1pd equal to 1px under 160 dpi device (mdpi).
So we want to design an Android app for xlarge Android devices with
mdpi density, we can define our UI size in pixel as 960 pixels in width
and 720px in height; Follow the same mapping rule, we can get
following Android App screen size UI design guideline:</p>

This size unit scales with the screen size</a> (this also mentioned in an answer here, about <code>SDP</code> library)</p>

","The difference between px, dip, dp, and sp is as follows: 
- **px** (pixel) is a physical pixel on the screen.
- **dip** (density-independent pixel) and **dp** are the same, which is a unit of measurement that represents a physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen. 
- **sp** (scale-independent pixel) is similar to dp, but it is also scaled based on the user's font size preference.

To design a UI for different screen sizes in Android, it's essential to understand these units and use them accordingly, along with providing graphics and images for different densities",,"I've come across a good article about designing Android apps UI for different screen resolutions, and I'd like to leave it here just for somebody searching in this area.

<p>The <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>LocalDate</code></a> class represents a date-only value without time-of-day and without time zone.</p>

<pre><code>String input = ""31/02/2000"";
DateTimeFormatter f = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern ( ""dd/MM/uuuu"" );
try {
    LocalDate ld = LocalDate.parse ( input , f );
    System.out.println ( ""ld: "" + ld );
} catch ( DateTimeParseException e ) {
    System.out.println ( ""ERROR: "" + e );

</code></pre>

<p>The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>java.time.DateTimeFormatter</code></a> class can be set to parse strings with any of three leniency modes defined in the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle</code></a> enum. We insert a line into the above code to try each of the modes.</p>

<pre><code>f = f.withResolverStyle ( ResolverStyle.LENIENT );

<p>The results:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ResolverStyle.LENIENT</code><br />ld: 2000-03-02</li>

<li><code>ResolverStyle.STRICT</code><br />ERROR: java.time.format.DateTimeParseException: Text '31/02/2000' could not be parsed: Invalid date 'FEBRUARY 31'</li>

<p>We can see that in <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html#LENIENT"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle.LENIENT</code></a> mode, the invalid date is moved forward an equivalent number of days.

The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/ResolverStyle.html#STRICT"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ResolverStyle.STRICT</code></a> mode throws an exception complaining that there is no such date.</p>

<p>All three of these are reasonable depending on your business problem and policies. Sounds like in your case you want the strict mode to reject the invalid date rather than adjust it.</p>

<p>I took your C# code and modified it slightly.  The C# code I use, in its entirety, is: </p>

<pre><code>using System;

    internal static string FormatByteArray(byte[] b)
    {

        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Error: {0}"", e.Message);
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>compile the above with </p>

<pre><code>csc.exe /target:exe /out:Bob.exe Bob.cs
</code></pre>

<p>I use the slowAES.wsc from the other post you referenced, with 2 changes: I do not call getPaddedBlock() for the key in the EncryptString or DecryptString() methods. This really needs a PBKDF but let's not worry about that now. Here's what the modified EncryptString looks like: </p>

<pre><code>function EncryptString(plainText)
{
  // this is really wrong - need a PBBKDF to get the key, instead
  // of just using the passphrase
  var key = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(_passphrase);
  // var nkey = slowAES.getPaddedBlock(key, 0, _keysize, _mode);
  var bytesToEncrypt = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(plainText);

  var result = slowAES.encrypt(bytesToEncrypt, 
      _mode,
      key,
      _keysize,
      _iv);
  return result['cipher'];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This means you have to use a passPhrase that is <em>exactly</em> the length required by the keysize.  If you use AES256, then pass a 32-char string (32 * 8 = 256 bits).  Seems like you figured this out already. </p>

<p>The client of the WSC component is also Javascript (though it can be any COM language).  Here's what I used.</p>

<pre><code>function toHexString(a)
{
    var ret = '';
    for(var i = 0;i &lt; a.length;i++)
        ret += (a[i] &lt; 16 ? '0' : '') + a[i].toString(16) + ' ';
    return ret.toLowerCase();
}


//var plaintext = ""Hello. This is a test. of the emergency broadcasting system."";
var plaintext = ""watson?"";

try
{
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext: "" + plaintext);
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext.length: "" + plaintext.length);

    WScript.echo( ""instantiate "");
    var aes = new ActiveXObject(""Ionic.Com.SlowAES"");

    WScript.echo( ""keysize "");
    aes.KeySize = 256;

    WScript.echo( ""passphrase "");
    aes.PassPhrase= ""12345678901234567890123456789012"";  // 32 chars long

    WScript.echo( ""mode "");
    aes.Mode = ""CBC"";

    WScript.echo( ""encrypting... "");
    var result = aes.EncryptString(plaintext);

    WScript.echo( ""Cryptotext: "" + toHexString(result));

    WScript.echo( ""decrypting... "");
    var decrypted = aes.DecryptBytesToString(result);

    WScript.echo( ""decrypted: "" + decrypted);
}
catch(e)
{
    WScript.echo(""Exception: "" + e); 
    //     WScript.echo(e.Number + "": "" + e.Name);
    WScript.echo(e.Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I then run this code, the Javascript and C# produces the same cipher text for a plaintext of ""watson?"", using AES256, passphrase of 12345678901234567890123456789012, and an IV of 16 bytes of zero.  The ciphertext generated is: </p>

<pre><code>8B 68 A6 23 08 2A D8 A0 EB 99 17 8F 69 03 18 FF
</code></pre>

<p>It successfully decrypts in both cases. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Though I packaged the slowAES encryption in a WSC, it will be interoperable running outside the COM environment as well. The WSC part is unnecessary for this question, but was necessary to demonstrate the answer for a prior question, which  was, ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/270510/how-to-encrypt-in-vbscript-using-aes"">how can I get VBScript and .NET AES to interoperate?</a>""</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>:  The source code that demonstrates AES interop between Javascript or VBScript and .NET <a href=""https://github.com/DinoChiesa/AES-Interop-Example"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is available</a>.  I extended the basic example given here to produce test apps in 3 languages: C#, Javascript and VBScript.  They all take the same set of arguments.  They each use a RFC2898-compliant key derivation function.  You can specify the password, salt, IV, and plaintext, as well as the number of RFC2898 iterations to use in the PBKDF2.  You can easily verify that the ciphertext is the same for each of these test programs. Maybe the example will be useful for someone. </p>

* The IV must be 16 bytes of zero.

","The ""use strict"" directive in JavaScript enables strict mode, which imposes stricter syntax and behavior on the code. It helps catch common coding mistakes, such as undeclared variables, by throwing exceptions instead of silently failing. For example, in strict mode, using an undeclared variable will throw a ReferenceError, whereas in non-strict mode, it will be implicitly declared as a global variable. Additionally, strict mode also changes the behavior of certain built-in methods, such as ensuring that the `this` keyword refers to the correct object.

2025282,"What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?","<p>The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as <strong>pixels (px)</strong>. A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable.</p>

<p>Screen resolution is measured in terms of number of pixels on the screen. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important.</p>

<p><strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device.</p>

<p>A density independent pixel (dp or dip) is equal to one pixel at the baseline density or 160 dpi (dots per inch).</p>

<p>1 px/1dp = 160 dpi/160 dpi</p>

<p>2 px/1dp = 320 dpi(2x)/160 dpi</p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>dpi is dots per inch</p>

<p>So, at 320 dpi, 1 dp is equal to 2 px.</p>

<p>Formula</p>

<p>px/dp = dpi/160dpi</p>

<p>Dots per inch (dpi) is a measure of the sharpness (that is, the density of illuminated points) on a display screen. The dots per inch for a given picture resolution will differ based on the overall screen size since the same number of pixels are being spread out over a different space.</p>

<p>Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. Suppose in a case, a tablet and phone has the same pixel resolution 1280 by 800 pixels (160 dpi) and 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi) respectively.</p>

<p>Now because a tablet is at baseline density (160 dpi) its physical and density independent pixels sizes are the same, 1280 by 800. The phone on the other hand has a higher pixel density, so it has half as many density independent pixels as physical pixels. So a phone has 400 by 640 density independent pixels. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you have two devices with similar screen size, but different pixel density, say one is 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi), and the other is 400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi), we don't need to define totally different layouts for these two devices as we can measure assets in terms of density independent pixel which is same for both devices.</p>

<p>800 by 1280 pixels (320dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p>400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p><strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size.
For accessibility purposes, Android allows users to customize their device's font size. Users that have trouble reading text can increase their device's font size. You can normally find this option in the display setting on your phone or tablet under font size. It's often also available through the accessibility settings.</p>

<p>With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. But when device's font size is large, for example 125%, 16 sp will translate to 20 dp or 1.25 times 16.</p>

<p>If you use dp as the unit for font size, then that piece of text has a specific physical size no matter if the user has customize device's font size. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.</p>

","Here is a brief and accurate summary of the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp:

* **px (pixels)**: the smallest unit of a screen, with more pixels making a sharper image.
* **dp (density-independent pixels) or dip**: a unit that allows designers to create assets that appear consistently across different screen resolutions and densities, with 1 dp equal to 1 pixel at 160 dpi.

However, virtually all hash table implementations offer O(1) on the vast, vast, vast majority of inserts. This is the same as array inserting - it's O(1) unless you need to resize, in which case it's O(n), plus the collision uncertainty.</p>

<p>In reality, hash collisions are very rare and the only condition in which you'd need to worry about these details is when your specific code has a very tight time window in which it must run. For virtually every use case, hash tables are O(1). More impressive than O(1) insertion is O(1) lookup.</p>

226953,WCF and confirmations - do I need to send back a 'OK got it' to client?,"<p>There are three messaging patterns mentioned here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Synchronous request-response    </li>
<li>Asynchronous send (fire and forget with one-way service)</li>
<li>Asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service)</li>
</ol>

<p>All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. </p>

<p>For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate.</p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default configuration.</p>

<p>This returns a 200 response on the same http connection once the service has completed all its tasks. This means that calls to the service will block while waiting for the response - your client will hang until the service has written to the database and done anything else it needs.</p>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 returned indicates that the message has been accepted. From the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http rfc</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. (...) The 202 response is intentionally non-committal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. </p>

<hr>

<p>Below is some more info about implementing these patterns in WCF. After writing it, it is pretty long but there are a couple of useful comments as well as the code.</p>

<p>As Whisk mentioned, Juval Lowy has an article covering a lot this detail (and more!) <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163537.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default behaviour in WCF so you should not need to do anything - it works with lots of different bindings including wsHttpBinding and basicHttpBinding.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that the behaviour described with your client hanging waiting for the 200 response occurrs even if you have a void Operation like so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>To set an operation as one-way you simply decorate it as so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Methods decorated in this way must only have a return type of void. One gotcha is that the service will happily build and you won't get an exception saying the service config is invalid until you connect to it.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>The interface code for creating a duplex callback service is:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract(CallbackContract = typeof(IMyContractCallback))]
interface IMyContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay=true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}

public interface IMyContractCallback
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void ServiceResponse(string result);      
}
</code></pre>

<p>And on the client side you need something like so to set up the callback:</p>

<pre><code>public class CallbackHandler : IMyContractCallback        
{
    #region IEchoContractCallback Members

    public void ServiceResponse(string result)
    {
        //Do something with the response
    }

    #endregion
}

// And in the client when you set up the service call:

InstanceContext instanceContext = new InstanceContext(new CallbackHandler());
MyContractClient client = new MyContractClient(instanceContext);

InputMessage msg = new InputMessage();

client.DoSomething(msg);           
</code></pre>

<p>In the service you would perhaps have some code like:</p>

<pre><code>class MyContractImplementation : IMyContract
{
    public void DoSomeThing(MyMessage Message)
    {

        string responseMessage;

        try
        {
           //Write to the database
           responseMessage = ""The database call was good!"";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            responseMessage = ex.Message;
        }

        Callback.ServiceResponse(responseMessage);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. If you: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Consume an exception, you will get no warning of the error (but the callback will happen)</p></li>
<li><p>Throw an unhandled exception, the service will terminate and the client will not even get the callback.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown.</p>
","To determine if you need to send a confirmation back to the client in WCF, you should consider the messaging pattern that best fits your needs. There are three options: 

1. **Synchronous request-response**: The client waits for a response (200 OK) after the service has completed its tasks.
2. **Asynchronous send (one-way)**: The client receives a 202 response as soon as the service infrastructure accepts the message, but does not wait for the service to complete.
3. **Asynchronous request-response (duplex)**: The client receives a 202 response and then a callback with the result of the service",There are three messaging patterns mentioned here:,"There are three messaging patterns mentioned here: All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs.

<p>Loading is 2.3x faster than your PIL-based code.</p>

<p>Your PIL code also has an unneeded copy: <code>array(img)</code> should be <code>asarray(img)</code>. It only costs 5% of the slow loading time. But after optimization this will be significant and you have to keep in mind which numpy operators create a copy.</p>

<h3>Fast decompression</h3>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/zstd/"" rel=""noreferrer"">zstd benchmarks</a>, when optimizing for decompression <a href=""https://python-lz4.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">lz4</a> is a good choice.

<p>The load time was measured inside Python (3.7.3), using the minimum wall-clock time over 20 runs on my desktop. According to occasional glances at <code>top</code> it always seemed to be running on a single core.</p>

<h3>For the curious: profiling</h3>

<p>I'm not sure if the Python version matters, most work is supposed to happen inside of C libraries. To validate this I've profiled the <code>pickle + lz4</code> variant:</p>

<pre><code>perf record ./test.py &amp;&amp; perf report -s dso
Overhead  Shared Object

   ...
</code></pre>

<p>Most time is spent inside of the Linux kernel, doing <code>page_fault</code> and stuff associated with (re-)allocating memory, probably including disk I/O. The high amount of <code>memmove</code> looks suspicious. Probably Python is re-allocating (resizing) the final array every time a new decompressed chunk arrives.

39900331,Why doesn't CLion link my project with OpenCV for Windows?,"<p>The short answer is, <strong>you will probably need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</strong>.  But given the number and range of partially answered and unanswered questions here* and elsewhere on using <a href=""https://www.jetbrains.com/clion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JetBrains' CLion IDE</a> with <a href=""http://opencv.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the OpenCV library</a>, I think an overview is needed (my notes are from CLion 2016.3 and OpenCV 3.1, YMMV):</p>

<ul>
<li>Though not produced by JetBrains, <a href=""https://cmake.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMake</a> is very central to CLion's operation.  Understanding CMake therefore helps greatly in diagnosing CLion build problems.  In particular CMake maintains a disk ""cache"" of settings which you may need to clear to incorporate changes to your environment (<em>Tools->CMake->Reset Cache and Reload Project</em>).</li>
<li><p>To make use of <em>OpenCV</em> in your build you must specify it in your project's <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> file.  You request that CMake locate your OpenCV location and link it to your <code>TARGET</code>.  An example of a sequence of commands from <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> for an executable named <code>mushroom</code> follows:
<code>
add_executable(mushroom ${SOURCE_FILES})
FIND_PACKAGE(OpenCV REQUIRED)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(mushroom ${OpenCV_LIBS})</code></p>

<p>(For more on <code>FIND_PACKAGE</code>, see <a href=""https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:How_To_Find_Libraries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMake:How To Find Libraries</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>FIND_PACKAGE</code> for package <em>XXX</em> works either by way of <em>FindXXX.cmake</em> files located at CMake's <code>Modules</code> directory, or by consulting environment variable <em>XXXX_DIR</em>.  On my system, no <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> file was present, so I relied on the <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> environment variable instead.  This must be set, not to the root of your OpenCV installation, but to the <em>build</em> folder beneath it.  I used an entry in <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> to set this variable, e.g.:</p>

<pre>set(OpenCV_DIR C:/Users/myacct/AppData/Local/opencv-3.0.0/build)</pre></li>
<li><p>To link with OpenCV, CMake uses either <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> or <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> (see previous point above) to locate a file named <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em>.  This file is generated by and ships with a particular build of OpenCV in order to document what components are present and where they are located.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Problems may occur when variable names used by OpenCVConfig.cmake conflict with those CLion has stored in its environment</em></strong>. In particular, if your OpenCV was built by Microsoft Visual C (<em>MSVC</em>), as is <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Windows distribution from opencv.org</a>, it won't work with CLion.    </p>

<p>Because CLion's build toolchain (<kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>S</kbd>-toolchain) uses either MinGW or Cygwin, <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> will search for OpenCV binaries under a subdirectory named <em>mingw</em> or <em>cygwin</em> <strong><em>and will find none</em></strong> because the binaries were built with MSVC (it will look in a directory like <em>vc11</em> or <em>vc12</em> instead).  This probably means <strong><em>you will need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</em></strong>.</p>

<p><em>Would reconfiguring OpenCVConfig.cmake to point to the MSVC binaries make this work?</em> you may ask.  Unfortunately the answer is still no, because <a href=""http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Interoperability_of_Libraries_Created_by_Different_Compiler_Brands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libraries built with one compiler typically cannot be linked with another one</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> or <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> likely contain diagnostic messages, but when CLion executes CMake for you, <code>message(STATUS)</code> calls are not displayed.  To make them display, change them to <code>message(WARNING)</code> or <code>message(FATAL_ERROR)</code>.  <em>But CLion 2016.3 EAP relieves this problem; see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/39398373/5025060"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/39398373/5025060</a>.</em></p></li>
<li><p>CLion does not indicate which .cmake script issued which diagnostics; don't assume they all come from the same script.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this provides some general guidance on resolving <em>CLion / CMake / OpenCV</em> compatibility problems.  Note that this does not cover <em>compiler</em> or <em>linker</em> issues; these will not appear until <em>CMake</em> completes its initial makefile build.  Compiler or linker issues occur at a later stage and are controlled by <code>include*()</code>, <code>link*()</code> and other commands in <em>CMakeLists.txt</em>.</p>

","For decompression performance in Python, consider using the `python-blosc` library, which is fast and easy to use for small arrays (<2GB). It achieves high decompression speeds, such as 4310 MB/s and 11740 MB/s, depending on the compression settings. To optimize performance, pre-allocating the array can significantly reduce decompression time. The library supports various compression algorithms, including 'zstd' and 'lz4', and can handle different array types, including f-contiguous, c-contiguous, and non-contiguous arrays, as well as arrays larger than 2GB.","You can use Python-blosc

I think it can be (with some minor changes) some kind of <em>reverse function</em> for <code>justify_hours()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>create or replace function unjustify_hours(interval)
returns interval language sql as $$
    select format('%s:%s',
        (extract (epoch from $1) / 3600)::int,
        to_char($1, 'mi:ss'))::interval;
$$;

select 
    unjustify_hours('23:00:00'),        --&gt; 23:00:00
    unjustify_hours('9 days 16:00:00'), --&gt; 232:00:00
    unjustify_hours('1 day 16:00:00');  --&gt; 40:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>to_char(interval, text)</code> cannot be helpful here, as</p>

<pre><code>select 
    to_char(interval '23:00:00', 'hh24:mi:ss'),        --&gt; 23:00:00
    to_char(interval '9 days 16:00:00', 'hh24:mi:ss'), --&gt; 16:00:00 (!)
    to_char(interval '1 day 16:00:00',  'hh24:mi:ss'); --&gt; 16:00:00 (!)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that an interval can be correctly formatted in many ways:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    justify_hours('100:00:00'),        --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
    justify_hours('1 days 76:00:00'),  --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
    justify_hours('2 days 52:00:00'),  --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
    justify_hours('5 days -20:00:00'); --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>Per <a href=""https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype-datetime.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the SQL standard all fields of an interval value must
  have the same sign, so a leading negative sign applies to all fields;
  for example the negative sign in the interval literal '-1 2:03:04'
  applies to both the days and hour/minute/second parts. PostgreSQL
  allows the fields to have different signs, and traditionally treats
  each field in the textual representation as independently signed, so
  that the hour/minute/second part is considered positive in this
  example. If IntervalStyle is set to sql_standard then a leading sign
  is considered to apply to all fields (but only if no additional signs
  appear). Otherwise the traditional PostgreSQL interpretation is used.
  To avoid ambiguity, it's recommended to attach an explicit sign to
  each field if any field is negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internally interval values are stored as months, days, and seconds.
  This is done because the number of days in a month varies, and a day
  can have 23 or 25 hours if a daylight savings time adjustment is
  involved. The months and days fields are integers while the seconds
  field can store fractions. Because intervals are usually created from
  constant strings or timestamp subtraction, this storage method works
  well in most cases. Functions justify_days and justify_hours are
  available for adjusting days and hours that overflow their normal
  ranges.</p>
</blockquote>
","PostgreSQL displays intervals in different formats because the calculation of intervals can lead to non-standard formats. When an interval is the result of subtracting two timestamps, it is displayed in a standard format (e.g., days, hours, minutes, seconds). However, when intervals are calculated separately (e.g., adding or subtracting intervals), the result may have a non-standard format. The `justify_hours()` function can be used to standardize the format, but there is no built-in reverse function. A custom function, `unjustify_hours()`, can be created to convert a standardized interval back to a non-standard format. Additionally, intervals",When an interval is <strong>a difference between two timestamps</strong>,"When an interval is <strong>a difference between two timestamps</strong> <strong>Calculations on intervals</strong> are executed on date part and time part separately, so they may lead to strange formats.

<p><code>'use strict'; </code></p>
<p>in your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean to user agents?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indicating that code should be interpreted in strict mode specifies to user agents like browsers that they should treat code literally as written, and throw an error if the code doesn't make sense.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> Consider in your <code>.js</code> file you have the following code:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: [NO STRICT MODE]</strong></p>
<pre><code>var city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Prints the city name, i.e. Chicago

<p>So why does the variable name is being printed in both cases?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without strict mode turned on, user agents often go through a series of modifications to problematic code in an attempt to get it to make sense. On the surface, this can seem like a fine thing, and indeed, working outside of strict mode makes it possible for people to get their feet wet with JavaScript code without having all the details quite nailed down. However, as a developer, I don't want to leave a bug in my code, because I know it could come back and bite me later on, and I also just want to write good code. And that's where strict mode helps out.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: [STRICT MODE]</strong></p>

city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Reference Error: asignment is undeclared variable city.

<p><em><strong>Additional tip:</strong></em> To maintain code quality using strict mode, you don't need to write this over and again especially if you have multiple <code>.js</code> file. You can enforce this rule globally in <code>eslint</code> rules as follows:</p>
<p><em>Filename:</em> <code>.eslintrc.js</code></p>

<p>In this function, we are using a variable called <code>name</code> inside the function. Internally, the compiler will first check if there is any variable declared with that particular name in that particular function scope. Since the compiler understood that there is no such variable, it will check in the outer scope. In our case, it is the global scope. Again, the compiler understood that there is also no variable declared in the global space with that name, so it creates such a variable for us in the global space. Conceptually, this variable will be created in the global scope and will be available in the entire application.</p>

<p>Another scenario is that, say, the variable is declared in a child function. In that case, the compiler checks the validity of that variable in the outer scope, i.e., the parent function. Only then it will check in the global space and create a variable for us there.
That means additional checks need to be done. This will affect the performance of the application.</p>

<li>Are they looking for ""John"" who lives on ""Hamburg Street"" in Springfield? </li>
<li>Are they looking for ""John"" who lives in the city of ""Hamburg""?</li>
</ul>

<p>Without knowing the user's intent, the best you can hope for is to OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you need to program in a ton of logic, depending on the number of words passed in:</p>

<p>2 words:</p>

<p>Search Employee data for term 1, Search Employee data for term 2, Search Address data for term 1, Search address data for term 2.  Merge results by term, order by most hits.</p>

<p>3 words:</p>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>I guess I would redesign the GUI to separate the input into Name and Address, at a minimum.  If that is not possible, enforce a syntax rule to the effect ""First words will be considered a name until a comma appears, any words after that will be considered addresses""</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Your best bet is still OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits.  Here's an example of that, and an example why this is not ideal without some pre-processing of the input to divine the user's intent:</p>

<pre><code>insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (1, 'John Hamburg')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (2, 'John Smith')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (3, 'Bob Hamburg')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (4, 'Bob Smith')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (5, 'John Doe')

insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (1, 'Main St.', 'Springville', 1)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (2, 'Hamburg St.', 'Springville', 2)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (3, 'St. John Ave.', 'Springville', 3)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (4, '5th Ave.', 'Hamburg', 4)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (5, 'Oak Lane', 'Hamburg', 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Now since we don't know what keywords will apply to what table, we have to assume they could apply to either table, so we have to OR the terms against each table, UNION the results, Aggregate them, and compute the highest rank.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, [Name], Street, City, SUM([Rank])
FROM
(
    SELECT emp.Id, [Name], Street, City, [Rank]
    FROM Employee emp 
    JOIN [Address] addr ON emp.Id = addr.EmployeeId
    JOIN CONTAINSTABLE(Employee, *, 'JOHN OR Hamburg') AS keyTblEmp ON emp.Id = keyTblEmp.[KEY]

    UNION ALL

    SELECT emp.Id, [Name], Street, City, [Rank]

    JOIN [Address] addr ON emp.Id = addr.EmployeeId
    JOIN CONTAINSTABLE([Address], *, 'JOHN OR Hamburg') AS keyTblAdd ON addr.Id = keyTblAdd.[KEY]   
) as tmp

GROUP BY Id, [Name], Street, City
ORDER BY SUM([Rank]) DESC

38315538,JavaScript | Angular | Controller As Syntax: Cannot Use `this`,"<p>The problem is certainly <strong>not</strong> that <code>this</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript.
There is no rule in the <em>controller as</em> syntax that says you would need to assign the value of <code>this</code> to a variable with the same name as the controller and I'm pertty sure angular won't do such thing either. Why would it? That would be incredibly stupid use of <code>Function</code> constructor and just a needless bug.</p>

<p>There's a simple way to test that JavaScript reserved words are not the issue here. Name your controller ""throw"". <code>""Parent as throw""</code>. <code>throw</code> is a reserved word, but does that <em>throw</em> errors? No. Does that work? Yes.</p>

<p><code>this</code> is, however, reserved in the context of angular's own template expressions. It's used to refer to the current <code>scope</code> of the expression.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=""Parent as this""&gt;
    {{log(this)}}
&lt;/div&gt;


angular.module('testApp', []).controller('Parent', function($scope){
    this.test = 'foo';
    $scope.log = function(arg){
        console.log(arg);
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>The above won't throw errors, but it won't log the controller either. Instead, it will log a <em>scope</em> object containing the <code>log</code> function and <code>$parent</code> and what not. </p>

<p>In fact, it will also contain something intresting to us: property <code>this: Object</code>, our controller. </p>

<p>And sure enough, change the template expression to <code>{{log(this.this)}}</code> and it will log the controller instance just fine. Still wouldn't use <code>'this'</code> as the name though, it would probably just cause more bugs by mistake than undefined functions ever have.</p>
","The issue with using `this` in Angular's ""controller as"" syntax is not due to it being a reserved word in JavaScript, but rather because `this` is reserved in Angular's template expressions to refer to the current scope.

1816723,Best practice for structuring a 'large' Rails app,"<p>I believe the benefits of isolating your concerns into separate apps outweigh the costs. I would probably start off with just 2 apps (one for the main site and superadmin, one for the client sites and admins), accessing the same database, but you could do 4.</p>

<p>The downside is you don't really have isolation since all your apps are tied to one database. You will eventually run into scaling problems with your database, but starting off simple with one database will get you launched. One strategy for scaling later would be to add a slave db that the client site and main site apps use, while the admin apps use the master db. This along with a TON of caching will get you pretty far.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with having multiple rails apps access one db, however you will need a way to share common code across your apps. Your models for the most part. I've done this before by tossing all my models in a plugin that I share as a sub-module in git or as an external in svn. Having separate apps will make each app smaller and easier to maintain.</p>

<p>However, where do you keep your migrations? Where do you test your models? I would opt for the superadmin app. Also, you make a change to a model or the schema, and now you have to check 2-4 apps and make sure they still work!</p>

<p>At any rate, having separate apps sets you up for SOA but you don't have to jump beyond a single db to start.</p>
","For a large Rails app, consider structuring it into separate apps (e.g., main site, client sites, admins) that share a database. This approach allows for better isolation and maintainability, but may lead to scaling issues with the database. To address this, you can implement caching, add a slave database, and consider a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with separate databases and inter-app communication through web APIs. This approach sets you up for future scalability, but can be implemented in stages, starting with a single database.","You will eventually run into scaling problems with your database, but starting off simple with one database will get you launched. One strategy for scaling later would be to add a slave db that the client site and main site apps use, while the admin apps use the master db. At any rate, having separate apps sets you up for SOA but you don't have to jump beyond a single db to start.","I believe the benefits of isolating your concerns into separate apps outweigh the costs. Having separate apps will make each app smaller and easier to maintain. Better isolation, separate db's and inter-app communication through web APIs (SOA) and you don't have to worry about that.

37774347,Why is my implementation of a map on a custom type not correct?,"<p>First, to explain the error message: you can't use <code>filter</code> in your definition, since</p>

<pre><code> filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
</code></pre>

<p>has to do with regular Prelude lists, not your <code>List</code>s -- i.e. <code>[a]</code> not <code>List a</code>. The error message arises because <code>filter</code> expects <code>a</code> in </p>

<pre><code> map f a = filter (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a
</code></pre>

<p>to be a list of something, but the signature you supplied declares that <code>a</code> is a <code>List</code> of something. Similarly <code>filter</code> returns a Prelude list of something, but the signature requires that it return a <code>List</code> of something. </p>

<p>The natural implementation of <code>map</code> for <code>List</code> would distinguish the cases of <code>List</code> that you gave in the type declaration, that is, it would ""pattern match"":</p>

<pre><code>mapList ::
    (a -&gt; b)
    -&gt; List a
    -&gt; List b
mapList f Nil = Nil
mapList f (t :. ls) = f t :. mapList f ls
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the program you wrote is perfectly valid, it just conflicts with the signature you gave it:</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let mapX f a = filter (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a
ghci&gt; :t mapX
mapX :: Eq a =&gt; t -&gt; [List a] -&gt; [List a]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Eq</code> constraint is required because you presuppose that <code>List</code>s be tested for equality and thus that their elements can be.  <code>f</code> is not used, so it just ends up as a 'could be anything' parameter, here <code>t</code>. </p>

<p>Of course, if you have your own <code>filterList</code> for <code>List</code>s it will also typecheck</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let filterList pred Nil = Nil; filterList pred (a :. as) = if pred a then a :. filterList pred as else filterList pred as

ghci&gt; :t filterList
filterList :: (t -&gt; Bool) -&gt; List t -&gt; List t

ghci&gt; let mapY f a = filterList (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a

ghci&gt; :t mapY
mapY :: Eq a =&gt; t -&gt; List (List a) -&gt; List (List a)
</code></pre>

<p>What this function does is delete null elements from a List of Lists, like <code>Prelude.filter (not . Prelude.null)</code>. Similarly, the actual function you defined (without the signature) deleted <code>Nil</code> Lists from a <em>Prelude list</em> of your Lists.</p>
","The implementation of `map` on a custom `List` type is incorrect because it uses the `filter` function from the Prelude, which operates on regular lists, not the custom `List` type. The correct implementation should use pattern matching to handle the cases of `Nil` and non-empty lists.

21803856,"Pentaho data integration, csv input, add filename column","<p>I know it sounds kind of backwards but you probably will want to use the <strong>Text File Input</strong> step to parse your CSV file, rather than the <strong>CSV Input</strong> which is a subset of options from the Text File Input with some performance advantages for delimited files.</p>

<p>With <strong>Text File Input</strong> there are a lot more options available to you for reading the file. You can set the <em>Filetype</em> as CSV and select your separator in the <em>Content</em> tab, and list out the fields you want to grab in the <em>Fields</em> tab. Using this step would solve your problem because in the <em>Additional output fields</em> tab you can specify a field in the stream to put your filename, extension, file path, etc.</p>

<p>The advantages you gain when using the <strong>CSV Input</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>NIO: Native system calls for reading the file means faster performance, but it is limited to only local files currently. No VFS support.</li>
<li>Parallel running: If you configure this step to run in multiple copies or in clustered mode, and you enable parallel running, each copy will read a separate block of a single file allowing you to distribute the file reading to several threads or even several slave nodes in a clustered transformation.</li>
<li>Lazy conversion: If you will be reading many fields from the file and many of those fields will not be manipulate, but merely passed through the transformation to land in some other text file or a database, lazy conversion can prevent Kettle from performing unnecessary work on those fields such as converting them into objects such as strings, dates, or numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need those advantages then you'll have to get at your file name another way, such as passing it as a named parameter and adding it to the stream with the Get Variables step.</p>

","To add a filename column when using a CSV input in Pentaho Data Integration, use the **Text File Input** step instead of **CSV Input**. This allows you to specify additional output fields, including the filename, in the **Additional output fields** tab.

57038055,"What are ""Activations"", ""Activation Gradients"", ""Weights"" and ""Weight Gradients"" in Convolutional Neural Networks?","<p>This question is similar to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38136058/6873133"">this</a> question, but not quite. Also, <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs#example-code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the ConvNetJS example code with comments (<a href=""https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/docs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the full documentation). You can take a look at the code at the top of the demo page for the code itself.</p>

<p>An <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">activation function</a> is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some ""threshold"" (this is specific for each different activation function). This comes from how neurons work, where they take some electrical input and will only activate if they reach some threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 1:</strong> The first set of images show the raw input image (the left colored image) and the right of the two images is the output after going through the activation functions. You shouldn't really be able to interpret the second image because it is going through non-linear and perceived random non-linear transformations through the network.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 2:</strong> Similar to the previous point, the ""activations"" are the functions the image pixel information is passed into. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gradient</a> is essentially the slope of the activation function. It appears more sparse (i.e., colors show up in only certain places) because it shows possible areas in the image that each node is focusing on. For example, the 6th image on the first row has some color in the bottom left corner; this may indicate a large change in the activation function to indicate something interesting in this area. This <a href=""https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> may clear up some confusion on weights and activation functions. And <a href=""https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> has some really great visuals on what each step is doing.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 3:</strong> This confused me at first, because if you think about a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ReLu function</a>, you will see that it has a slope of one for positive <code>x</code> and 0 everywhere else. So to take the gradient (or slope) of the activation function (ReLu in this case) doesn't make sense. The ""max activation"" and ""min activation"" values make sense for a ReLu: the minimum value will be zero and the max is whatever the maximum value is. This is straight from the definition of a ReLu. <s>To explain the gradient values, I suspect that some Gaussian noise and a <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs/blob/4c3358a315b4d71f31a0d532eb5d1700e9e592ee/src/convnet_net.js#L43"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bias term of 0.1</a> has been added to those values.</s> <strong>Edit:</strong> the gradient refers to the slope of the cost-weight curve shown below. The y-axis is the loss value or the calculated error using the weight values <strong>w</strong> on the x-axis.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 4:</strong> See above.</p>
","In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the key terms are:

1. **Activations**: The output values of a neural network layer after applying an activation function, which introduces non-linearity to the model.
2. **Activation Gradients**: The slope of the activation function, representing the rate of change of the output with respect to the input. This helps identify areas in the image that each node is focusing on.
3. **Weights**: The learnable parameters of the neural network that are adjusted during training to minimize the loss function.
4. **Weight Gradients**: The slope of the cost-weight curve, representing the rate",,"An activation function is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some ""threshold"" (this is specific for each different activation function).

<p>Less smelly alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get needed data from the 'child' and call the method in the 'parent' with that data</li>
<li>Pass the data the 'parent' holds to the 'child' and put the method there so the 'child' can call it</li>
<li>Call the method in the 'parent' and pass the result to the 'child'</li>

21428179,Event ports with Firebird 1.0.3 and firewall setup,"<p>By default Firebird uses a random port for events. This doesn't work well with firewalls, so Firebird also offers an option to use a fixed port, using the <code>RemoteAuxPort</code> setting in <code>firebird.conf</code>.

Migrating from Firebird 1.0 to Firebird 1.5 should be relatively easy (migrating to more recent versions like Firebird 2.5 might be more work).</p>
<p>For details look at the section <em>Common Problems: Firewalls</em> in <a href=""http://www.flamerobin.org/events_paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Power of Firebird Events</a> by Milan Babuškov:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client has a regular connection to Firebird server at its port (3050 by default, but can be changed). When it is registering for events, it sends the request over that connection. The server opens another connection at some random port (4012 for example) and sends that port number to the client. The client then connects to that port.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>When client registers for events, the server opens a random port (ex. 6023) and sends that info to the client. This is where the problem becomes evident: the client tries to connect to that port (6023) on the firewall (as it “sees” the firewall as a server). Since the port is completely random, there are certainly no forwarding rules for that port on the firewall, so connection is denied. Using this setup, there is no way to make it work, short of forwarding all the traffic (all ports) to Firebird server, which is the exact thing we wish to avoid by placing the firewall in front.</p>
</blockquote>
","To use event ports with Firebird 1.0.3 and a firewall, you'll face issues due to Firebird's default use of random ports for events.

<p>In your first try block:<br>

  <p>Unhiding rows with the method -unhideRowsAtIndexes:withAnimation: did not work correctly prior to macOS 10.13 when using non-contiguous sets of rows. This has been fixed for all applications on macOS 10.13.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll notice in the second paragraph that your issue is mentioned.</p>

<p>If you’re developing for an earlier version of macOS, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>func unhideRows(at indexes: IndexSet, animation: NSTableView.AnimationOptions = []) {
    if #available(macOS 10.13, *) {
        outlineView.unhideRows(
            at: indexes,
            withAnimation: animation
        )
    } else {
        for range in indexes.rangeView {
            outlineView.unhideRows(
                at: IndexSet(integersIn: range),
                withAnimation: animation
            )
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I wish I could say that this fixes the problem 100% of the time, however, that doesn't seem to be the case. Every once in awhile, I still seem to run into bounds exceptions like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>-[__NSArrayM objectAtIndex:]: index 11 beyond bounds [0 .. 10]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be due to other factors, such as my semi-complex filtering code, but as I can’t actually see what Apple’s doing in its <code>NSTableView</code> methods like <code>_updateVisibleViewsBasedOnUpdateItems</code>, I’m just not sure.</p>

<p>Oh, well. I thought I should post an answer so other folks struggling with this issue are aware of the bug. Good luck and safe travels, my fellow earthling.</p>
","The issue of `NSTableView` crashing when calling `unhideRowsAtIndexes` is due to an AppKit bug that was fixed in macOS 10.13.

226931,How to map classes in NHibernate using Roles or Composition,"<p>It seems to me that this is more a question around how to model a domain well, rather than an NHibernate mapping issue.</p>

<p>Once you've sorted out your domain modelling, I think you'll find the NHibernate mapping falls out relatively easily.</p>

<p>One place to look to get your head around the idea of modeling Roles is to look for ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_colors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Color Modeling</a>"" - <a href=""http://www.nebulon.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jeff de Luca</a> has <a href=""http://www.nebulon.com/articles/fdd/adsposters.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some resources</a>, though the idea originated with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Coad"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Peter Coad</a></p>

<p>The basic idea is to separate the identity of a participant from the role they play in an activity.</p>

<p>For example, you might have a Person object that captures the identify of a particular person.</p>

<p>Then, a completely separate object ""Student"" that captures the additional information to record the enrolment of a person as a student. Each instance of Student would have a reference to the person enrolled. A single person may be related to many ""Student"" records, one for each distinct enrolment.</p>

<p>In parallel, you could have a distinct ""Tutor"" object that records employment details when someone is hired to teach students in one-on-one situations. The Tutor object captures the additional details around how someone is employed as a tutor.</p>

<p>This structure gives you great flexibility - one person (Joe Bloggs) may just be a student, another person (Jane Doe) may just be a tutor, and a third (Chuck Norris) may be both.</p>

<p>Also, introducing another role (Lecturer, Marker, Administrator) becomes easier because the additions don't require changes to existing objects.</p>
","To map classes in NHibernate using roles or composition, focus on domain modeling rather than NHibernate mapping. Consider the concept of ""Color Modeling"" which separates an entity's identity from its roles. For example, a ""Person"" object can have separate ""Student"" and ""Tutor"" objects, each capturing additional information for that specific role, allowing for flexibility and ease of introducing new roles without modifying existing objects.","For example, you might have a Person object that captures the identify of a particular person.","It seems to me that this is more a question around how to model a domain well, rather than an NHibernate mapping issue. Once you've sorted out your domain modelling, I think you'll find the NHibernate mapping falls out relatively easily. One place to look to get your head around the idea of modeling Roles is to look for ""Color Modeling"" - Jeff de Luca has some resources, though the idea originated with Peter Coad
The basic idea is to separate the identity of a participant from the role they play in an activity. This structure gives you great flexibility - one person (Joe Bloggs) may just be a student, another person (Jane Doe) may just be a tutor, and a third (Chuck Norris) may be both. Also, introducing another role (Lecturer, Marker, Administrator) becomes easier because the additions don't require changes to existing objects."

3949147,Cannot use polymorphism because of generic base class,"<h2>Preliminary Assessment</h2>

<p>With this statement,</p>

<pre><code>public class Derived1 : Base&lt;Derived1&gt; {
</code></pre>

<p>you're using Derived1 in two different ways according to the base class.  </p>

<p>You're effectively telling the C# compiler that Derived1 both: </p>

<ol>
<li>inherits Base </li>
<li>and Base uses instances of Derived1 through non-inheritance means.  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is not wrong (if that's what you really want), but it's unusual for most programming scenarios; you normally choose one or the other. However the benefit of your logic is: not only do you have an implicit instance of Derived1 through inheritance (same for any other derived class), but the base class can <em>also</em> handle other external instances of that same derived type through the type parameter <code>&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<p>One problem I see in the Base class is it turns into a kind of circular scenario when using the factory method as intended, because, to support all derived classes it would need to support something like <code>class Base&lt;T&gt; where T:Base&lt;T&gt;</code>. That's next to impossible to declare because you would have to say in a circular fashion: <code>Base&lt;Base&lt;Base&lt;!!!&gt;&gt;&gt; baseref = null;</code> where !!! represents an infinite number of the same. </p>

<hr>

<h2>One Solution...</h2>

<p>One possible (and strong solution) is to move the Type parameter from the class to the factory Create method and restrict its usage to the Base class type like so:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

public abstract class Base 
{
    public static T Create&lt;T&gt;() where T : Base
    {
        return Activator.CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;();
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I have made the base class abstract which restricts instantiation to the derived types; however <strong>you can still use base class references</strong> (see <code>switch</code> statement usage below).    </p>

<p>These derived classes still inherit from base. </p>

<pre><code>public class Derived1 : Base
{
}

public class Derived2 : Base
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your factory method is restricted to create only instances of derived types.  The logic has been swapped around so the derived type is given to the factory method instead of the factory method being called on it.</p>

<pre><code>public class Program
{
    bool SomeFunction()
    {

    Base baseref = null;

     switch(DateTime.Now.Second)
     {
       case 1:
        baseref = Base.Create&lt;Derived1&gt;();  // OK
       break;

       case 2:
        baseref = Base.Create&lt;Derived2&gt;();  //OK
        break;

       case 60:
        baseref = Base.Create&lt;string&gt;(); //COMPILE ERR - good because string is not a derived class
        break;
     }

     // pass baseref somewhere     
    }
}

","The issue arises from using a generic base class with a derived class that inherits from it, causing a circular scenario. To resolve this, the type parameter can be moved from the class to the factory method, restricting its usage to the base class type. This approach allows for polymorphism while preventing instantiation of the base class directly, ensuring that only derived types can be created through the factory method. The derived classes inherit from the base class, and the factory method is used to create instances of these derived types, providing a solution to the original problem.","you're using Derived1 in two different ways according to the base class. and Base uses instances of Derived1 through non-inheritance means.

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you explain to me how to access the numbers of the array? I'm trying to print them using this, but it's printing 0 all the time:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>    li      $s0,0xFFFF0010
    li      $s1,0xFFFF0011

    div     $t3,$t8,10
</code></pre>

<p>For a simple printing of the array, I'm not sure how this code helps you. Without the context of the surrounding code, it's difficult for me to speculate as to what the code is doing.</p>

<p>It looks like you're trying to do your own equivalent of <code>printf(""%d"",num)</code>, but there is already a syscall to output an integer to the screen. I'd use that. But ... If you truly need to ""roll your own"", I've included code to do that.</p>

<p>Printing the array is similar to the input of the array.</p>

<p>I've reworked the previous example code. The input of the array is now a function. I removed the hardwired limit value of 250 in favor of using a new label: <code>arrend</code> [so, have a look]</p>

<p>Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array.</p>

<p>To manually do what syscall 1 does, I've added the <code>prtint</code> function. <code>arrprt</code> will use the syscall, but if you want it to use <code>prtint</code>, comment out the syscall and uncomment the block that calls <code>prtint</code></p>

<p>Here's the new code:</p>

2. **User Input**: It prompts the user to input the size of the array and the elements of the array.
3. **Array Printing**: The code includes a function `arrprt`",The input of the array is now a function.,"This will allow <code>1000 / 4</code> numbers or <code>250</code>.

<p>What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids]. It looked like:</p>

<p>An ActiveRecord 'find' method can take an array of ids, but not a hash of values. What you were originally submitting to 'find' in this line:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(params[:name_ids])

<p>...was the value for params[:name_ids]: </p>

<pre><code>{""7""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Партия"", ""which""=&gt;""Крутая""}, ""1""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""1"",

<p>When what you wanted was:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(['7','1','4'])

<p>which is what calling params[:name_ids].keys gives you. </p>

<p>The second problem was this line:</p>

<pre><code>name.update_attributes!(params[:name].reject { |k,v| v.blank? })
</code></pre>

<p>There was no value ':name' in params, so calling 'reject' on it cause the 'no method' error -- there is no 'reject' method on the nil object. What you wanted was to update the attributes for the 'name' that corresponded to the particular name in the loop. This meant you wanted to get the values out of params[:name_ids][:id] where :id was the id of 'name'. </p>

<p>It all goes back to the way fields_for created the params to begin with. This line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% fields_for ""name_ids[#{name.id}]"", name do |name_fields| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>meant that params would contain a hash called 'name_ids', with keys corresponding to name.id, that themselves would contain hashes of attributes that ActiveRecord could use in the update_attributes method. </p>

<p>There's a good bit of the famous Rails magic to keep track of in there -- does that help?</p>
","The ""Unknown key(s)"" ArgumentError is caused by passing a hash to the `Name.find` method, which expects an array of IDs. To fix this, use `params[:name_ids].keys` to get the IDs.

There was no value ':name' in params, so calling 'reject' on it cause the 'no method' error -- there is no 'reject' method on the nil object. What you wanted was to update the attributes for the 'name' that corresponded to the particular name in the loop. meant that params would contain a hash called 'name_ids', with keys corresponding to name.id, that themselves would contain hashes of attributes that ActiveRecord could use in the update_attributes method."

18484535,maintaining cache state in different servers,"<p>If you ultimately decide to move the cache outside your main webserver process, then you could also take a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing"" rel=""nofollow"">consistent hashing</a>. This would be a alternative to a replicated cache.</p>

<p>The problem with replicated caches, is they scale inversely proportional to the number of nodes participating in the cache. i.e. their performance degrades as you add additional nodes. They work fine when there is a small number of nodes. If data is to be replicated between N nodes (or you need to send eviction messages to N nodes), then every write requires 1 write to the cache on the originating node, and N-1 writes to the other nodes.</p>

<p>In consistent hashing, you instead define a hashing function, which takes the key of the data you want to store or retrieve as input, and it returns the id of the server in the cluster which is responsible for caching the data for that key. So each caching server is responsible for a fraction of the overall keys, the client can determine which server will contain the sought data without any lookup, and data and eviction messages do not need to be replicated between caching servers.</p>

<p>The ""consistent"" part of consistent hashing, refers to how your hashing function handles new servers being added to or removed from the cluster: some re-distribution of keys between servers is required, but the function is designed to minimize the amount of such disruption.</p>

<p>In practice, you do not actually need a dedicated caching cluster, as your caches could run in-process in your web servers; each web server being able to determine the other webserver which should store cache data for a key.</p>

<p>Consistent hashing is used at large scale. It might be overkill for you at this stage. But just be aware of the scalability bottleneck inherent in O(N) messaging architectures. A replicated cache is possibly a good idea to <em>start with</em>.</p>

<p>EDIT: Take a look at <a href=""http://infinispan.org/docs/5.3.x/faqs/faqs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Infinispan</a>, a distributed cache which indeed uses consistent hashing out of box.</p>
","To maintain cache state across multiple servers, consider using consistent hashing, which assigns cache data to specific servers based on a hashing function, allowing for efficient scaling and minimizing disruption when servers are added or removed. This approach can be used as an alternative to replicated caches, which can become inefficient as the number of nodes increases.",This would be a alternative to a replicated cache. Consistent hashing is used at large scale.,"If you ultimately decide to move the cache outside your main webserver process, then you could also take a look at consistent hashing. This would be a alternative to a replicated cache. The problem with replicated caches, is they scale inversely proportional to the number of nodes participating in the cache. So each caching server is responsible for a fraction of the overall keys, the client can determine which server will contain the sought data without any lookup, and data and eviction messages do not need to be replicated between caching servers. Consistent hashing is used at large scale."

19389238,Why do the following program leaks memory?,"<p>You're not doing anything wrong. GTK widgets use reference counting, but in your programme all the references are taken care of, so you're not (manually) leaking anything.</p>

<p>So why does Valgrind claim you are?</p>

<p>Firstly, GLib has its own ""slab"" memory allocator, called <code>GSlice</code>, which is generally faster than system <code>malloc</code> for small allocations. Unfortunately, it confuses Valgrind, but if you set the environment variable <code>G_SLICE=always-malloc</code>, <code>GSlice</code> is effectively turned off.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can set the <code>G_DEBUG=gc-friendly</code>, which is supposed to help Valgrind produce more accurate results (although it my experience it generally doesn't make any difference).</p>

<p>Both of these environment variables are listed in the <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.38/glib-running.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GLib documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, Valgrind will still report that your app leaks memory. The reason for this is that GTK (and its underlying libraries) allocate some ""static"" memory at start-up that doesn't get freed until the programme quits. This isn't really a problem, because typically the programme ends as soon as <code>gtk_main()</code> returns, and then the OS frees any remaining resources, so you're not <em>really</em> leaking anything. Valgrind thinks you are though, and for this reason it would be nice to have a <code>gtk_deinit()</code> function, but sadly there isn't one.</p>

<p>The best you can do instead is to teach Valgrind to ignore these things, via a suppressions file. The <a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/Valgrind"" rel=""nofollow"">Valgrind page on the Gnome Wiki</a> has details on all this and more.</p>

<p>As for the DnD issue, in my case the cause appeared to be that I was running Genymotion 'as administrator' (Why? Complicated: Because I have an unrelated virtualBox machine using a native disk image, which requires me to start virtualbox in privileged mode, which will crash Genymotion if it's not also running in privileged mode). However when I started GenyMotion not 'as admin' the dnd issue did not appear.

3. If drag-and-drop is not working, use a file explorer with root support to manually install the Genymotion-ARM-Translation zip file and the Chrome APK. 

This approach allows you to install Chrome on Genymotion without using the GApps zip file, which can cause crash notifications.",,This is what worked for me: It's not needed and causes a lot of crash notifications.

<p>On the contrary to the suicidal <code>::dontwait</code> flag in the Problem 2 root cause, the Problem 2 root cause is, that a blocking-form of the first <code>.recv()</code> here moves all the worker-threads into an undeterministically long, possibly infinite, waiting-state, as the <code>.recv()</code>-blocks proceeding to any further step until a real message arrives ( which it does not seem from the MCVE, that it ever will ) and so your pool-of-threads remains in a pool-wide blocked-waiting-state and nothing will ever happen until any message arrived.</p>

<h2>Update on how the <code>REQ/REP</code> works :</h2>

<p>The <strong><code>REQ/REP</code></strong> Scalable Communication Pattern Archetype works like a distributed pair of people - one, let's call her Mary, asks ( Mary <code>.send()</code>-s the <strong><code>REQ</code></strong> ), while the other one, say Bob the <strong><code>REP</code></strong> listens in a potentially infinitely long blocking <code>.recv()</code> ( or takes a due care, using <code>.poll()</code> to orderly and regularly check, if Mary has asked about something or not and continues to do his own hobbies or gardening otherwise ) and once the Bob's end gets a message, Bob can go and <code>.send()</code> Mary a reply ( not before, as he knows nothing when and what Mary would ( or would not ) ask in the nearer of farther future ) ) and Mary is fair not to ask her next <code>REQ.send()</code>-question to Bob anytime sooner but after Bob has ( <code>REP.send()</code> ) replied and Mary has received Bob's message ( <code>REQ.recv()</code> ) - which is fair and more symmetric, than a real life may exhibit among real people under one roof :o)</p>

<p>The code?</p>

<p>The code is not a reproducible MCVE. The <code>main()</code> creates five Bobs ( hanging waiting a call from Mary, somewhere over <code>inproc://</code> transport-class ), but no Mary ever calls, or does she? Not visible sign of any Mary trying to do so, the less her ( their, could be a (even a dynamic) community of N:M herd-of-Mary(s):herd-of-5-Bobs relation ) attempt(s) to handle REP-ly(s) coming from either one of the 5-Bobs.</p>

For a short time after a digit is pressed, you should keep the cursor on the newly-typed character; if the same digit is pushed again, you should change the newly-typed character.  If another digit is typed, make the selected digit 'permanent' and show the cursor on the character for the new key.  If no key is pushed for a second or so, advance the cursor to the next position.

Is not due to media Query but the viewport <strong>width=device-width</strong> is returning 768 instead of the 320 it returned in &lt;= iOS6.x, when running an iPhone application in 'Compatibility Mode' on an iPad.</p>

<p><strong>Fixing on the remote page</strong>
The best solution is to edit the viewport on the remote page by modifying the value of the 'width' attribute or removing it all together.</p>

","The provided answer does not directly address the issue of a delay when loading an image from the internet into a CircleImageView in Android. However, it does provide a custom implementation of a CircleImageView with various features such as border, fill color, and overlay. 

To address the delay issue, consider the following:

* Use a library like Glide or Picasso to load images asynchronously, which can help reduce the delay.
* Compress or resize the image before loading it into the CircleImageView.
* Use a placeholder image to display while the actual image is being loaded.

38108020,"Is this pattern a service locator, or a command factory, or something else?","<p>This implementation is not the Factory because it doesn't create new instances.</p>

<p>It isn't Service Locator either, because it is not locating services - now this requires a few words of explanation.</p>

<p>Service locator should return distinct interfaces. Your method is returning objects implementing a single common interface. Here is the signature of a Service Locator:</p>

<pre><code>T LocateService&lt;T&gt;() { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the dreaded signature which has caused so much troubles to developers worldwide. The problem is that signature of this method doesn't tell what is the kind of objects the consumer may depend on. Let me show it with a longer example:</p>

<pre><code>class ServiceLocator {
    T Locate&lt;T&gt;();
}

class Golum {

    ServiceLocator locator;

    Consumer(ServiceLocator depedency) { ... }

    void beNice() {
        Preciousss myPrecious = this.locator.Locate&lt;Previousss&gt;();
        myPrecious.DoMagic();
    }
}

void main() {
    new Golum(new ServiceLocator()).beNice(); // Fails!
}
</code></pre>

<p>This piece of code is the sublimation of all evil that comes with misuse of service locators. Main function is initializing the Golum class, but it has no clue what Golum requires. Golum just asks for a service locator, any service locator, and then gets going. When beNice method is invoked, it turns that particular service locator object that was passed has no knowledge of the Preciousss class at all, and then call to Locate fails.</p>

<p>You will need to import System.IO to use methods of the File class. You can use <code>File.ReadAllLines</code> to get an array of strings; each member of the array will contain one line from the text file.</p>

<p>Next, you will want to loop through the lines splitting each line into 3 sections. Use the <code>For Each...Next</code> type of loop. You can use the <code>String.Split</code> method passing in your <code>""|""c</code> parameter. The c tells the compiler that this is a <code>Char</code> not a string because <code>.Split</code> is expecting a <code>Char</code> Now you can use the <code>.Add</code> method to add the sections to the appropriate list.</p>

<p>After the loop, you can assign the 3 list to the <code>.DataSource</code> property of the appropriate <code>ListBox</code>.</p>

<a href=""https://codesandbox.io/s/epic-swartz-iu3qp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://codesandbox.io/s/epic-swartz-iu3qp</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> use of <code>indexOf</code> in <strong>filterGender</strong> function</p>

<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong> directly compare the gender instead of <code>indexOf</code></p>

<pre><code>const filteredGender = this.list.filter(
    user =&gt; user.gender.toLowerCase() === lowerCaseGender
);
</code></pre>

<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> You are filtering records from the <code>this.state.list</code> variable and then update it in same <code>state</code> variable.</p>

<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Use another variable <code>this.list</code> in <code>constructor</code> and use it to filter the records.</p>

<p>Define variable in <code>constructor</code></p>

<pre><code>constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      list: [],
      search: """"
    };
    this.list = []; // define new list here...
  }
</code></pre>

<p>You have to assign upcoming list to <code>this.list</code> variable in <strong>getList</strong> function</p>

<pre><code>this.list = response.data.result;
</code></pre>

<p><strong><code>getList</code> function should be look like below.</strong></p>

<pre><code>getList = async () =&gt; {
    const api =
      ""https://gorest.co.in/public-api/users?_format=json&amp;access-token=3qIi1MDfD-GXqOSwEHHLH73Y3UitdaFKyVm_"";

    await axios
      .get(api)
      .then(response =&gt; {
        this.list = response.data.result; // assign list in variable
        this.setState({
          list:this.list,
          isLoading: false
        });
      })
      .catch(err =&gt; {
        console.log(err);
      });
  };
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have to update both filter function as below. Instead of <code>this.state.list</code> use <code>this.list</code>.</p>

<pre><code>filterGender = gender =&gt; {
    const lowerCaseGender = gender.toLowerCase();
    const filteredGender = this.list.filter(
      user =&gt; user.gender.toLowerCase() === lowerCaseGender
    );

    this.setState({ list: filteredGender }, () =&gt; console.log(this.state.list));
  };

  filterAge = () =&gt; {
    const ageList = this.list.map(age =&gt; {
      return age.dob;
    });

    const filteredAge = this.list.filter(

","To structure a large Rails app, consider splitting it into multiple smaller apps with RESTful resources to enable communication between them. Alternatively, use a plugin like Subdomain Fu to manage subdomains. If a single database is preferred, use `establish_connection` in Rails. Splitting the app into 3-4 clusters can also improve speed and maintainability by grouping similar functionality together.","also if your application is large enough to maintain than splitting them in two or three would be good idea, with restfull resources you can make your applications talk to each other and so.","I see the kind of problem you are facing is, trying to build an application which will have various sub domains, so account_manager a plugin can solve your problem. also if your application is large enough to maintain than splitting them in two or three would be good idea, with restfull resources you can make your applications talk to each other and so.

438105,$data findAll query in CakePHP checking values from second table,"<p>Supernovah -</p>

<p>Please clarify one thing for me: you write that you want to only have values put into $data when table1.id is found in table2.sub_id.  Do you mean that table2.sub_id is a foreign key, linking to table1?</p>

<p>I think Beau is right -- if you have the models correctly linked, using a HABTM or belongsTo, etc., variable, the findAll should automatically pull the associated records from table2.</p>

<p>The final caveat is that the model associations are affected by the value of Model->recursive.  If you have changed the value of the recursive property in your code, it would alter how deep the model relations are allowed to go on a given query.</p>

169420,Generic Java Framework to Manage Bidirectional Associations and Inverse Updates,"<p>Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism.  If your objects are JavaBeans, then you are looking at using PropertyChangeSupport and firing property change events.</p>

<p>If you do that (or have some other mechanism for detecting changes), then Glazed Lists provides an <a href=""http://publicobject.com/glazedlists/glazedlists-1.5.0/api/ca/odell/glazedlists/ObservableElementList.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ObservableElementList</a> that could easily be used to handle the association synchronization from the list end (i.e. adding A to List&lt; A> automatically calls a.setB(b)).  The other direction is easily handled using property change monitoring (or equivalent).</p>

<p>I realize that this isn't a generic solution, but it seems like it would be an easy foundation for one.</p>

<p>Note that something like this would <em>require</em> a special list implementation in the B class - no way short of AOP type solutions that you could handle it in the general case (i.e. using ArrayList or something like that).</p>

<p>I should also point out that what you are trying to achieve is something of the holy grail of data binding.  There are some decent implementations for binding at the field level (stuff like getters and setters) (see JGoodies binding and JSR 295 for examples).  There is also one really good implementation for list type binding (Glazed Lists, referred to above).  We use both techniques in concert with each other in almost all of our applications, but have never tried to go quite as abstract as what you are asking about.</p>

<p>If I were designing this, I would look at something like this:</p>

<pre><code>AssociationBuilder.createAssociation(A a, Connector&lt; A&gt; ca, B b,  Connector&lt; B&gt; cb, Synchronizer&lt; A,B&gt; sync)
</code></pre>

<p>Connector is an interface that allows for a single interface for various change notification types.  Synchronizer is an interface that is called to make sure both objects are in sync whenever one of them is changed.</p>

<pre><code>sync(ChangeInfo info, A a, B b) // make sure that b reflects current state of a and vice-versa.  
</code></pre>

<p>ChangeInfo provides data on which member changed, and what the changes actually were.  We are.  If you are trying to really keep this generic, then you pretty much have to punt the implementation of this up to the framework user.</p>

<p>With the above in place, it would be possible to have a number of pre-defined Connectors and Synchronizers that meet different binding criteria.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the above method signature is pretty similar to the JSR 295 createAutoBinding() method call.  Property objects are the equivalent of Connector.  JSR 295 doesn't have the Synchronizer (instead, they have a binding strategy specified as an ENUM - plus JSR 295 works only with property->property binding, trying to bind a field value of one object to that object's list membership in another object is not even on the table for them).</p>
","To manage bidirectional associations and inverse updates in Java, you can use a combination of event notification mechanisms, such as PropertyChangeSupport, and libraries like Glazed Lists, which provides an ObservableElementList. A generic solution would require a special list implementation and could be achieved through an AssociationBuilder that takes in connectors and synchronizers to handle change notifications and updates. This approach is similar to JSR 295's auto-binding method, but would need to be more flexible to accommodate various binding criteria.","Note that something like this would <em>require</em> With the above in place, it would be possible to have a number of pre-defined Connectors and Synchronizers that meet different binding criteria.","Unless you abstract out the setters, you are going to have to provide some sort of event notification mechanism.

","The provided code implements a 9-key keyboard logic to print QWERTY keys. It uses a 2D array `KeyMap` to map numeric keys to their corresponding alphabetic characters. The code enters a loop where it checks for key presses and releases, and uses a timer to determine when to shift to the next character. If the same key is pressed multiple times within a certain time frame (`PHASE_WAIT`), it cycles through the associated characters. When a different key is pressed or the time frame expires, the current character is committed to a buffer.",,Adapting Amardeep's answer:
